The unique point about PH7 is the view it provides through big windows of the hustle of Gachibowli and high-rise buildings around.\n","\n","FOOD :-\n","I tried lot many things here ! Here is the detailed review of every item:\n","\n","MOCKTAILS:\n","-\n","PH7 SPECIAL MOCKTAIL- It literally holds the name! The most colorful mojito I ever came across, the flavors will tickle your taste buds!\n","\n","BLUE SEA- Its so beautiful to look at! The blue shade darkens down the bottom which contains lichi cream and makes this mojito special for sweet lovers.\n","\n","PINA COLADA- You might wanna skip this one, I found the flavors not complementing each other.\n","\n","FLAVORED VIRGIN MOJITO - Most recommended drink for hot summers. Refreshing, minty and relaxing !\n","\n","SALADS:-\n","STIR FRIED VEGETABLES- The main thing about the salads is its seasoning, the taste of the cooked veggies was so good. They could go a bit less on the oil though.\n","\n","VEG SPRING SALAD- It gives you the authentic taste of the vegetables, the dressing of the salad and spices used makes it tasty!\n","\n","MAIN:-\n","\n","BUTTER PANEER & ROTI- I prefer Paneer curries to be spicy and buttery, and no doubt they nail it! Its pretty heavy, I was almost done with 2 Rotis.\n","\n","SICILIAN PIZZA - The pizza was stuffed a lot with toppings, cheese was a bit less. You can mention to add more cheese to make it better. It was okay overall.\n","\n","CRISPY CORN - The presentation of the dish was unique and catchy. The taste was anyway a bit different from my liking, as i prefer it salty n spicy, and not sweet. Could be my own preference. You can still try it out.\n","\n","OVERALL:-\n","Pour House 7 is the go-to spot if you're around Gachibowli and are hunger-stuck! I would surely recommend this place.
