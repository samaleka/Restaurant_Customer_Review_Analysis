Located inside the SLN terminus, it attracts a relatively young crowd living in the nearby IT hubs.\n","\n","I went over there to try out their Weekend Buffet. First things first, their Buffet layout was well spread. The starters were served on the table accompanied by an array of curries and rice dishes to choose from. The drinks offered by them included Mojito, Zen Zero and Mint Julep. The drinks were average and needs quite improvement.\n","\n","Speaking about their starters, I had their Chicken Tangdi, Malai Paneer tikka, Salt and Pepper prawns, Lemon pepper Chicken tikka, Mutton Seekh kebab and Veg Seekh kebab.\n","\n","Amongst all the starters, I loved their Chicken tangdi kebab. The chicken was super juicy and was cooked to perfection. The use of proper marination was quite evident in the taste of the meat. Next up, I also liked their Lemon pepper Chicken tikka. It had a subtle flavor of lemon all thanks to the dominating flavor of the pepper.\n","\n","For mains, the spread comprised of two chicken main course dishes, two veg main course dishes accompanied by Dal, Assorted breads, Biryani and Salads. The chicken dishes were Chicken curry and Chicken tikka masala. I found both the curries simply wonderful just because of the fact that they were tasting much like home cooked chicken. For veg, their was Mutter Paneer and Paneer butter masala. I liked their Mutter Paneer as it was really balanced in terms of flavor.\n","\n","Their Biryani was a slight disappointment for me. It could have been much more flavorful and the use of boneless chicken didn't really serve justice to the dish. Apart from this, I also had my hands on their Veg thai curry. It was served with steamed rice. To be honest, the preparation of Thai Green Curry was too good but the only thing which upset me was that it was sweeter than the normal version. Maybe, they can work upon the use of Cocunut cream in the curry.\n","\n","For desserts, I had their Gajar ka Halwa, Kheer and Ice cream. The desserts were pretty much ordinary and needs ample improvement all together.\n","\n","All in all, the place has got a huge potential. All they need to do is to work upon slight glitches in their drinks and few main course items. Happy eating. :)\n","Output: {'food': ['Chicken Tangdi kebab', 'Lemon pepper Chicken tikka', 'Mutter Paneer', 'Chicken curry', 'Chicken tikka masala', 'Paneer butter masala', 'Mutter Paneer', 'Chicken

\"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: We went to Cascade for Birthday dinner and opted for buffet.\n","\n","Ambiance: very beautiful. Not clustered and has a relaxed atmosphere to it. \n","Service: the moment you go in they had all the details as I had booked through a app and we were escorted to our table the service has been prompt and excellent with polite staff and courteous behavior. \n","Food: Very good spread. lot of options for salad. I went for the egg salad and the chicken salad. Very tasty.\n","Starters: good spread of veg and non veg. Very happy with the Hong Kong fish and zaffrani chicken. both were very tasty and must have. In veg crispy veg was a must have. Most of the starters were cold. Considering we went almost at the beginning not sure how it can be cold so fast. Moving on to the main course. another great spread and good options for veg and non veg. Fish was very salty so i had to pass that. other dishes were very good and mashed potato is a must try. Chettinad chicken was another must have. They had rotis and nans to order (live). I tried the Mongolian rice from the live counter. did not excite my taste buds much. Another problem with the main course some items were cold or lukewarm. \n","Some more options in main course was one veg biryani, Mutton biryani, chicken curry, Chicken curry was something I would go for again but not so much happy with the biryani but again being a hyderbadi the taste buds for biryani is absolutely different. \n","Desserts: another vast variety and i will give it 10/10. \n","\n","Overall: if not for the food being cold and fish item being salty the rating would have been better. Overall I would recommend this place for a casual dining. if you are looking for a place to have a relaxed atmosphere and have food at leisure away from the hustle and bustle this is a good place to be. \n","Suggestion: I some how feel the placing of the spread was not apt. I mean it was very confusing at time and we had to take help again and again. for example. Soups is placed after the biryani. A little more organized would be good...\n","Output: {'food': ['egg salad', 'chicken salad', 'Mongolian rice', 'Chettinad chicken', 'Mutton biryani', 'Chicken curry', 'Chicken curry', 'Mongolian

When you stay at a hotel and the hotel prepares same of similar dishes almost every day, you will be easily sick and tired of having the food all the time. Besides, India is a country where it is hard to find restaurants that serve pork or beef dishes. Furthermore, as being a Korean, cilantro or coriander are something that we are not used to and do not use in the food cooking, but most dishes in India are with this herb regardless of the type of food; Italian, Japanese Thai or Chinese. However, I find foods at this Collage restaurant at Hyatt Hyderabad is not using those herbs for Western or Asian food, and this is what I like this restaurant the best. Besides, for buffet dinner, majority of the food are daily changed. I personally consider this the most important factor for long-term stay guest just like me.\n","\n","Therefore, my food life at Collage @Hyatt Hyderabad is always happy because of so much efforts the <<chef Prashant>>, <<chef Pushkar>>, <<chef Sankhar>> and <<chef Santosh>>, are putting into to cater my taste. In addition, they study Korean food or other Asian food and cook for me as special treatment to please me. Sometimes, we even talk about food making and recipes, and they cook some special food as per my special request.\n","\n","During breakfast and dinnertime, these chefs always come to my table and ask if the buffet foods at the Collage restaurant fit my taste.\n","\n","I strongly recommend everyone that Collage is a place you must have meals during your stay at Hyderabad. Lastly, through this review, I sincerely express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart.\n","Output: {'food': ['dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: Positive:\n","1.

And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. She hasn't been off with her recos even once. But Zing's came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.\n","\n","In all honesty, when the starters arrived, I felt that the portions were quite small.

The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. The raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this Bangal!\n","\n","It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!\n","\n","THIS IS COMFORT FOOD! SANELY PRICED, IMPECCABLY PORTIONED, HONEST FOOD THAT WARMS YOU UP FROM WITHIN!\n","Output: This is a review of a restaurant in Kolkata. The reviewer had a pleasant experience at the restaurant, with the service and food being excellent. The reviewer highly recommends the dishes, particularly the Kalbi Bokum, Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns, Naga Steam Fish, and Teriyaki Chicken. The drinks were also good, with the Summer Time and Summer Lime being recommended. The reviewer notes that the portions were small but still delicious, and that the main courses were particularly good. The reviewer concludes that the restaurant serves comfort food at a reasonably priced rate.\n","<|endoftext|>\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to

Hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in India! Irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, Hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! But where to eat in Hyderabad? As an ardent foodie, I get this question asked, all the time. So to my non-Hyderabadi friends I have always been recommending legendary Irani restaurants for Biryani and or any Hyderabadi dish. Because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!\n","\n","But that has changed now. Thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. Now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic Biryani. The legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! In the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the Cyberabad area.\n","\n","One such new entrant is Hyderabadi Dawat. It is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! And its evident in their authentic Hyderabadi food.\n","\n","Hyderabadi Daawat is located at Gachibowli-Kondapur road. It is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. Just how Hyderabadis like it! The menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a Nawabi Hyderabadi Wedding reception!\n","\n","We were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! We started with a Mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker!\n","\n"," The starters started with Achari Paneer Tikka which was surprisingly good. Though not their forte, it had perfect Taste and softness! The veg Shami was another great starter! The only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!\n","\n","Then came the first non-veg starter, the Murgh Kalmi Kebab! Chicken Thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. It had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! It was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!\n","\n","Then came Seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. Because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! But this one at Hyderabadi Daawat made me feel like home! It had the perfect Hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. Had a proper Seekh Kebab after a long time!\n","\n","Tandoori Jhinga was just good! Nothing great but then no flaws either!\n","\n","Their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!\n","\n","The first one was the Sikandari Raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! It was one hell of a royal dish! But the meat could have been cooked more. In fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.\n","\n","The second khaas peshkash was Chelo Kebab Platter! A Persian delicacy that consists of Rice, a Seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! This dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! Nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. Not very spicy though!\n","\n","Finally, it was time for the king of them all, the Murgh Musallam. A Mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. Then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. It is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. See the pics and decide for yourself!\n","\n","That was our Nawabi Hyderabadi Daawat at this royal restaurant!\n","\n","I'm glad the Hyderabadi Cuisine is now going fine dine!\n","\n","Take my word, Hyderabadi Daawat serves, authentic Hyderabadi food!\n","Output: Hyderabadi Daawat is a new restaurant serving authentic Hyderabadi cuisine. The menu features a variety of dishes, including Mutton-based shorba, Veggie Shami, Murgh Kalmi Kebab, Seekh kebab, Tandoori Jhinga, Sikandari Raan, Chelo Kebab Platter, and Murgh Musallam.

And its not just the flavours on the taste buds, its almost as if you could taste the history of a civilization. And with the imprint Nizams have left on the city of Hyderabad in every aspect, it doesn't even come as a surprise as to why there are an unnumerable amount of dishes in Hyderabadi cuisine.\n","\n","Hyderabadi Dawaat is one new joint in Gachibowli area which is trying to bring back the cuisine of Nizams by serving dishes from our very favourite Hyderabadi cuisine to the best of its authenticity. From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights.\n","\n","Coming to the food, I went in for a dinner to sample out their menu with some of my friends where we began the meal with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba which was a flavour-pumped version of a simple mutton shorba and an awesome start to the meal. With every sip, the flavour became increasingly intense with the hearty mutton tartness on the back of the tongue.\n","\n","Then came an array of appetizers both for the veg as well as non veg. From the vegetarian ones, I personally loved the Achaari Paneer Tikka which had soft pieces of paneer marinated in a balanced pickle spice mix which had just the right amount of tanginess to it. From the non vegetarian menu there were quite a few who made to my favourites including the Murgh Kalmi Kebab - chicken leg pieces marinated heavy handedly in spice and finished in tandoor to perfection, Gosht Seekh Kebab - plain old mutton kebabs with juicy, succulent mutton mince and Patrani Fish - fish covered in a subtle coconut based marinade, wrapped in cabbage and finished in tandoor.\n","\n","From among the specialties from the area, the restaurant presented us with their Sikandari Rann which was a whole leg of lamb marinated with whole spices like cloves, cinnamon, pepper and cashew nut, finished slowly in a tandoor and served on a bed of fried onions and garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side. Each element of the dish was beautiful with the lamb taking the center stage - tender, juicy and delicious. In a similar fashion, restaurant also serves specialty big platters like Chelo Kebabs which is a Persion styled serving of Mutton and Chicken Kebabs on a bed of Saffron Rice and Murg Mussallam which had a whole chicken doused in a delicious ginger garlic marinade and cooked till tender, served again on a bed of rice.\n","\n","Even after the Rann, the show wasn't over and we went in for mains trying out their Gosht Masala, Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which went really well with some hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans. Nargisi Kofta was my favourite one which had the same delicious mutton keema wrapped around boiled eggs and tossed in a rich spicy onion-tomato gravy. Gosht Masala was a tiny bit more spicier that the Kofta and had flavourful bone-in mutton pieces. With the Achari Chicken, the restaurant again showed excellence in terms of balance of flavour as the dish wasn't too tangy as preparations in most of the other restaurants turn out to be. Gil-e-Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal with a sweet note, both of which were less of sugar and actually quite good.\n","\n","The service here at Hyderabadi Dawaat was just as good as their food. The staff was warm and corteous and took care of each and every need for us diners be it a glass of water or a change of plates. I was highly impressed with the kitchen which though took time to deliver the dishes to the table but also put in extreme care to provide us only what was the best. In a nutshell, if you want to experience the true cultural heritage of Hyderabad on a plate, Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list!\n","\n","instagram.com\n","Output: Hyderabadi Dawaat is a new restaurant in Gachibowli, offering delicious dishes that showcase the rich culinary heritage of Hyderabadi cuisine.

The fried green tomato BLT is awesome. Even more so is the duck, cashew peanut butter and pepper jelly sandwich. Just amazing. I get it every time I go there.

Yes. Please. I don't really need to say more. But because I am me, I will.\n","\n","Came here on Wednesday night with a group of friends to play trivia. We arrived at 8pm, thinking we were smart early birds. However, we soon learned that our complacency was ill-advised. A waitress informed us that avid trivia-players typically show up around 6:30 to claim tables, but that we could stand a round a high-top if we so desired. We figured that was better than nothing (and it was really really cold), so we stayed put. As it turned out, we were able to hoard a few stools and put together a nice little setup for ourselves. Soon after, we realized that the place had filled up considerably, so our timing wasn't as bad as we initially thought. So my advice is definitely to show up early, 8 at the VERY latest, if you want to sit comfortably while trivia-ing. \n","\n","The space itself is pretty standard for a pub. A good number of tables in back, three or four high-tops in front, and a handful of seats at the bar. It can get a bit tight at times, but the servers do a good job of keeping everything relatively contained. \n","\n","Can't speak much to the food here, as we just got a couple things to munch on--fries and the Mediterranean platter. Both were fine. I wasn't expecting to be wowed by either--that's pretty much as standard as it gets. Hummus? Good. Fries? Good. Can't complain. \n","\n","The drinks were a different story, though. The two specials were enough to impress me, though one was just a crappy light beer. So crappy, in fact, that it tasted like soda (it's Bud Light Lime, for anyone desperate to know). But for three bucks, I'll take it. As I mentioned, the chocolate stout was superb. Rich and flavorful, and again, only $3! Plenty of places would charge two or three times that amount. So I was very pleased with this.\n","\n","Finally, I must mention the trivia. Props to whomever comes up with these questions, because they were really damn difficult. There were a few throw-aways (i.e. Alan Rickman was the answer to a Diehard question), but most of the stuff was impossible. Quite humbling, really. The music round was \"90s grunge\", which is possibly the most difficult genre other than jazz/classical to identify, if you've never been a fan of that music. I think I got the Pearl Jam and Nirvana songs right, but I was otherwise useless. Still, a good time was had by all. Would definitely recommend!\n","Output: The restaurant has a standard layout with tables, high-tops, and a bar. The food is average, with some decent options like hummus and fries. The drinks are a bit pricey, but the chocolate stout is worth it. The trivia is difficult, but the music round is a fun challenge. Overall, it's a good place to go for a casual night out.\n","<|endoftext|>\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: Black Sheep is right next door to my office and I never knew it existed, until today when we went there to celebrate two of my coworkers' birthdays. For someone who doesn't fancy beer but enjoys cider, the cider list was pretty stingy. Magners? Really? How about I just drink water. I went with \"ol' faithful\" Angry Orchard but wish there was a wider selection of cider considering the typical pub atmosphere. After a few drinks, we ordered some apps for the table. The cheesesteak spring rolls were good (but not as good as the ones at Ladder 15). I enjoyed the fries we got with the spicy mayo(?) dipping sauce. Nachos were different, but decent. Our waiter wasn't the best. He spilled one of the cups of water on the table (and my iPhone and Kate Spade wallet). Usually I chalk things like this up as a mistake, but he was continually careless and reaching over me instead of to the side of me to place things on the table. The ceiling next to us was leaking through patched plaster. Looks like they're gonna have to get that fixed... Again. Black Sheep would be good as a short stop on a bar crawl, but overall not somewhere I'd choose to go back to.\n","Output: {'food': ['cheesesteak spring rolls', 'fries', 'nachos'], 'drink': ['water', 'ol' faithful','spicy mayo']}\n","<|endoftext|>\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: The Cheese \"hold the beef\" burger was phenomenal!

We had to leave before desert in order to make the Tony Bennett concert, and the staff asked us to return after the concert for desert.  So, we did.

They are all also very knowledgable about the dishes, never having to run back to the kitchen when you ask what the side sauce is made of.\n","\n","Best times to go: brunch or week night dinner. Happy hour gets a little crazy and filled with bros ordering burgers. The burger is incredible, but there is more to gain from trying whatever weird paté is in the starters section or the beet salad. Same goes for brunch, go with something you wouldn't normally order - you won't be disappointed by any of the food (unless you're really sensitive to salt and seasoning, nothing is tasteless here).\n","\n","Drinks are steep - unless you're getting beer during happy hour, but that's typical given the neighborhood.

We came well stocked with wines and beers to supplement a multiple course dinner!\n","\n","After covering ourselves in towels and washing our hands, it was time to get down to business. Towels were great since eating with your hands is not an easy feat, at least not for me. Course after course, we indulged and explored new and interesting tastes. We all raved about the first 3-salad course of eggplant, carrot, and cucumbers. Don't hold back on the pita. Grab 3 or 4 because you'll need them to help grab the veggies! The second course of B'stella was great! By looking at the towels around me, this was the messiest dish. The third course of spicy chicken literally fell off the bone, and was very flavorful. It came out super hot, so the pitas that came around helped. For our fourth course, we chose the lamb with almonds and honey over the beef. The lamb did not disappoint, and the honey definitely added just the right amount of sweetness. By this time, all of us were stuffed, yet we had two more courses! The couscous was probably our least favorite since it had to follow some strong dishes. Thankfully, the fruit and delicious mint tea helped slow things down. Baklava was also a nice treat, thought it wasn't anything to write home about.\n","\n","Overall, I'd recommend this place. For date nights, group dinners, and large celebrations.

Well, just that day, they were receiving a small shipment of 6 boxes of Mama Bella's meatballs that were very popular and in demand considering how unoften they have them available.  A nice lady put it in as an order for me so they would hold them.

For years, when I go from Jersey to Philly I always made it a point to stop by to find some rare bottles or just breweries that do not distribute outside of Philly.  Last night a few of us had a great dinner in Philly (we drank Petrus Pale, Sixpoint Resin, Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA, New Holland Dragon's Milk Imp Stout).  The friends I went with have really been getting into learning about beers and trying new styles and breweries.  We drove over to the Foodery and my friend's wife joined me in the store.  She was looking for Imp Stouts/RIS/Barrel Aged stuff and wanted to get her husband some Double IPAs.  We looked around and I gave her advice as to which bottles she would like, which were rare and pricey, and which ones she could get in NJ near her home.  She had great questions and we were having a good time.  \n","\n","What happens next, the guy behind the counter starts mocking us!!!  Seriously!  She was asking me where certain breweries were located and where she could purchase them.  The guy behind the counter (white guy, short black hair, little preppy in a disheveled way), in a pompous, condescending voice started saying to a friend sitting behind the counter, \"Well I know about beer.  I'm the smartest.  This beer is from Maryland, and it is wonderful.  This one you can only get in Philly.  This one is perfect, you need to get it.  Beer, beer, beer, I know everything about beer.\"  This went on for almost a minute and we just ignored it.  Why?  Why did he need to be such a D-bag!  Why mock customers.  Then when we went to the counter to pay he was acting like such an arse!  He kept looking at the credit card and referring to my friend by her first name, not hitting on her, but acting goofy like he had more than a beer or three in his belly.  Not to mention it took him more than a few minutes to process the purchase and ring us up because he kept messing up.\n","\n","This is just rude, obnoxious and bad customer service.  We had such a good night until the service at a bottle shop ruined it.  My friend was very excited to be introduced to this shop as we got there, but now will never set foot in there again.  She is usually very mild mannered, but after we left she even said she wanted to give the guy a d-ck punch.  And I have never heard her use profanity that way before.\n","\n","Gave one star for good bottle section.\n","Output: {'food': ['Imp Stouts/RIS/Barrel Aged stuff'], 'drink': ['Petrus Pale', 'Sixpoint Resin', 'Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA', 'New Holland Dragon's Milk Imp Stout']}\n","<|endoftext|>\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: Huge slice, one is enough.

\"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: Decided to come here for a mid afternoon brunch for hangover relief.  I previously purchased the $15 for $30 groupon and decided today was the fateful day to use it.  Arrived at La Creperie around 2:00pm only to find it empty save for two or three tables.  Come to think of it, every time I've walked by this place or eaten here, no matter what time of day, it's EMPTY.  Dying restaurant?  Perhaps.\n","\n","In defense of La Creperie and in disagreement with previous reviews, service was fine.  Guess it's hit or miss.  Our crepes came out fairly quick.  I had the La Gitane--bacon, some kind of cheese, onion, and herb de provence--and my gf had one with mushrooms, ham, some kind of cheese.  I can't remember exactly what we got simply because it wasn't memorable.  It was good, just nice, simple, and flavorful.  However, for what it was, I think the price points are too high.  At the end of the meal I was satisfied, but maybe even still a slight bit hungry?  In comparison, go to the crepe place on Penn's campus and you get a monster sized crepe for $7.  Granted, it isn't as tasty and delicate, but it serves me TWO meals, a feat that should not go without praise.  So is 75% of a meal worth twice the price of a meal worth 200% stomach full-ness?  Everyone still with me?  haha.\n","\n","Unfortunately, the answer is no.  The price is just above the line of what I'd be willing to pay given quality and size.  So is that what keeps La Creperie empty?  I think that's part of it.  The reasons why I give this place three stars ends here, but I will offer up my opinion on what other factors might be making this a less than appealing dining spot given its populated center city location.\n","\n","1.  I'd rather go here on a cold rainy day than a warm and sunny.  It's sooo stuffy in there, the windows don't open, and air circulation is poor.  I feel like a caged animal in there when the weather is nice.\n","\n","2.  Location.  Sansom street has a lot of hidden gems on it, but I don't think it gets the walking traffic that it deserves.\n","\n","3.  Decor.  The tables will rock back and forth with the slightest touch of an arm.  My girlfriend commented that she felt she was in the Caribbean, not France.\n","\n","4.  The double edged sword - I think when people see an empty restaurant, they wonder what's wrong with it.  And they will skip over it.\n","\n","In conclusion, if you read this essay on La Creperie, bravo.  I hope you find it useful.  All things considered, this place is the definition of mediocre.\n","Output: La Creperie is a mediocre restaurant in the heart of the city. The food is decent, but the price is too high for the quality and size. The service is fine, but the atmosphere is stuffy and the decor is tacky. The location is not very walkable and the restaurant is often empty.\n","<|endoftext|>\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","/tmp/ipykernel_47613/2366552114.py:21: SettingWithCopyWarning: \n","A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\n","Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n","\n","See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n","  subsample_df['ner_results'] = subsample_df['text'].apply(apply_ner)\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Subsample saved to yelp_NER_sample_18.csv\n","Processing subsample  19\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: I had a large bowl with rice and mixed green base, salmon and octopus, seaweed, tobiko, ponzu, jalapeno, and sriraca with sesame seed.

In my experience, the pasta here has been pretty delicious. Creamy and rich, as well as super filling. If you're ordering one of the pasta dishes and you don't have a bottomless pit of a stomach, it's likely you're going to have leftovers (which I love). The mushroom ravioli is SO GOOD. And so is the sweet potato appetizer! A word of advice though: the asparagus salad does not feel very salad-like. Its just a couple of eggs over easy sitting on top of cooked asparagus with some bacon. Not particularly flavorful or wowing. \n","\n","The ambiance of this place is pretty on point if you ask me. The first time I went there Eta James played quite a few times, along with other calm, but soulful music that was never overpoweringly loud. The restaurant is fairly low lit and there are cute fake candles on all the tables. They also keep the front door to the place closed, so there's no background noise coming in from Broad St. They do have a TV in there, but it's mounted near the entrance and it's the only one. Overall, it's a nice restaurant but not pretentiously so. \n","\n","If you're not ordering pasta, I might be a little more critical of the food. I recently ordered their \"Hanger Steak,\" asking that it be done \"medium rare\" and there was only one piece of steak that had some pink to it. All the other pieces were well done. Disappointing for a dish that was $23. I've also noticed that they tend to overcook asparagus, until it's soft, easy to bend, and a nuisance to cut through (the Hanger Steak came with asparagus, as well as another dish my partner's mom got- same issue with her asparagus). \n","\n","As for the garlic knots? Sometimes they're awesome- warm and soft on the inside. When they're room temperature you realize they're nothing crazy. BUT the garlic oil is delicious and I personally want to try making some myself. They lightly boil the cloves in oil till they're tender and as easy to spread on the knots as butter. \n","\n","Oh! Something else I noticed that was kind of weird. They use the square app, so your server will just come up to you with a tablet in hand once you've given them your card. They don't leave the tablet there for filling out, they just hold it out in their arms and wait for you to finish filling the form out. At first I thought it was nice (fan of the paperless route), but then I felt kind of awkward not being able to take a second to consider how much I wanted to tip. I didn't notice this myself, but a friend of mine mentioned that the standard options for tipping also start at 18%. While that doesn't necessarily bother me, I could see that being a nuisance for others that might prefer 15%. There's also a 2 card max to the table, so venmo is your friend if you want to eat here with other people. \n","\n","Last time I went there I made a reservation and still ended up waiting around 15 minutes. Maybe this was just because they had two really large groups of people with reservations for the night, but it was kind of off-putting since they had tables open. \n","\n","TL;DR: order pasta if you come here.

So I've been on a small hiatus from Yelp but now I'm back and reeling on the new flavors landing in Philly. And speaking of new flavors, the Ramen scene seems to have gained popularity in Philadelphia.\n","\n","So, it's hard for me to dis on a place and especially Cheu since I love Ben Puchowitz's restaurant Matyson. I also really want to like Cheu because its ambience reminds of the BEST noodle bar in D.C. Toki. \n","\n","But the ambience is all it has going for it right now, especially after being charged $14 for a large bowl of a minimal amount of noodles in my Cold Sesame noodle order.\n","\n","How do you mess up Cold Sesame Noodles? And how do you warrant charging $14 for half the bowl of noodles? Was I paying for the ambience alone?\n","I ordered Cold Sesame noodles on a really hot day in July thinking its your basic Asian meal, not too much can go wrong there and it won't break the bank. BOY was I wrong!\n","\n","First of all, the point of a noodle bar is overflowing noodles in your bowl not the other way around. And even though you don't want to stay authentic to a tradition of cooking ramen, the basics are still important. \n","\n","My noodles were too al dente. The pork belly was a nice touch but if that was the reason for the $14 bill then no thank you. The kimchee cucumber on top covered with chili oil was a nice touch but it was poorly done,the kimchee lacked the original balance of just enough sourness to just enouph spice to give it its umph. Instead it was doused with chili oil that took away from the flavor of the noodles. And even though Laban praised this dish as close to authentic my authentic asian palette states otherwise.\n","\n","For now I'll stick to the lesser of two evils and frequent the Ramen chain that is Terakawa. It's broth is on point and its noodles overflow the bowl. \n","\n","Ben, a small suggestion, don't stray too far from traditional flavoring when your dealing with oriental cuisine and don't rush to add too many culinary delights to the menu before mastering what your \"noodle bar\" is named after.\n","Output: The food items mentioned in the review are:\n","- Ramen\n","- Cold Sesame noodles\n","- Pork belly\n","- Kimchee cucumber\n","- Chili oil\n","<|endoftext|>\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: I love, love, love this place! I always try to stop by whenever we are in Philly, we actually came here a few times from NY just to have dinner here.  Did I mention that I love this place?  My ultimate goal is to try all of the dishes on the menu, which has been difficult as I always order the same 2-3 dishes each time.  See below for the dishes I have tried, which are ranked based on my preference:\n","\n","Prah-Hok Kateeh - My absolute favorite dish and I have to order it every time I come here.  It doesn't look much in pictures, but trust me, you will love it.  It is basically ground pork that is flavored to perfection and you eat it with an assortment of vegetables.  I can eat this dish everyday!  Actually Khmer Kitchen inspired me to try to replicate this dish at home, I have tried a bunch of different variations of this dish using recipes from the internet, and none have even come close to the ones served here.\n","\n","Sah-Law Machue Yuin - Another dish that I always order. It is a sweet and sour soup that comes with either chicken, fish or shrimp.  My personal favorite is the fish version.  Due to the fact that there are no Cambodian restaurants in NYC, I try to order a similar dish when I go to Vietnamese restaurants, but needless to say, none have come close to this dish.  I love the fresh pineapples (most other places use canned ones), and the gourd melon, which I have never had before I came here, now I love it!\n","\n","Cha Throp - stir fried eggplant that comes with either pork or chicken.  I love the pork version, the pork just melts in your mouth.  The flavor could be similar to eggplant with garlic sauce from Chinese restaurants, but Khmer Kitchen uses big pieces of perfectly flavored pork instead of group pork, which I think makes a huge difference\n","\n","Cha Mussels - The sauce for this dish is out of this world.  True story, my friend actually took the leftover sauce to go so that she can eat it over rice for lunch the next day, no mussels, just the sauce.  The mussels are great too, but the sauce this the star of this dish, and I kind of wish they serve bread with this dish so I can sop up that delicious heavenly sauce.\n","\n","Pleah Sak-Koe- It is basically a rare beef salad.  For people who are a bit squeamish about eating rare beef, this is probably not the dish for you. For the more adventurous eaters, give this a chance.  It is super refreshing, particularly during the summer.  Could be a bit spicy, so be forewarned!\n","\n","Sah-Law Machue Kr'ung - another soup with either chicken or beef.  I liked the aforementioned sweet and sour soup better, but this one has my favorite protein, i.e. beef.  The beef is super tender and flavorful.  I picked out all of the beef while everyone else was busy talking (no, that's not rude at all)\n","\n","Kuh-Puh Ch'in - Shrimps that are lightly battered and fried to perfection.  I am not a huge fan of shrimp, but if I have to eat shrimp, I would eat this any day.\n","\n","Cha La-Pauh - stir fried pumpkin with either chicken or pork.  I don't like pumpkin, but the pork in this dish is so yummy.  I had to be sneaky and pick out the pork as I did with the previously mentioned soup.  Everyone that liked pumpkins at the table raved about this dish.\n","\n","Cha Kr'ung - stir fry dish with celery and pepper, comes with either chicken or beef.  It was just ok, nothing too spectacular to report.  \n","\n","Cha Lok-Lak - my least favorite dish.  It is basically beef cubes on a bed of lettuce.  Perhaps I should've dipped the beef in the sauce longer, but it is not as flavorful as the rest of the menu.\n","\n","This is a family restaurant with the mother and grandmother in the back cooking, and coming here feels like going home to mom's cooking, well if your mom is Cambodian and an amazing cook.  The waiter is super friendly, I assume he's the son/grandson to the chefs.  He's always very patient in answering whatever questions we have, and always accommodating with all of the annoying requests I have (i.e. more vegetables for the Prah-Hok Kateeh, more napkins, takeout containers for the leftover sauce).  The only downside is that the hours can be unpredictable, so definitely call beforehand.  I have been disappointed numerous times because they had to close early, or open late for various reasons, as I don't live in Philly, I couldn't wait around for them to open.  It has been a running joke between us that we are 'lucky' if the place is actually open when they say they would.  However, they have a loyal customer in me, I will come back here again and again!\n","Output: {'food': ['Prah-Hok Kateeh', 'Sah-Law Machue Yuin', 'Sah-Law Machue Kr'ung', 'Kuh-Puh Ch'in', 'Cha La-Pauh', 'Cha Kr'ung', 'Cha Lok-Lak'], 'drink': []}\n","<|endoftext|>\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: My family and I had a really terrible experience at Farm and the FIsherman, and I feel compelled to share it with you.  \n","\n","First of all, the service was terrible.  They seated us an hour after our reservation, and didn't give us anywhere to sit while we waited, or any food or wine glasses (it's a BYOB) to tide us over.\n","\n","The food was not great.  The bluefish appetizer was served cold, which was not indicated on the menu, and was a little undercooked.  I had the pigs ear salad, which was way too salty, and the pigs ears were basically inedible.  Normally, I love pigs ears, but these were tough, chewy, and didn't sit well in my belly.  The farro piccola soup was fine, but was more like a hearty chicken soup than an outstanding appetizer at a boutique fancy restaurant.\n","\n","On to the main course.  I had the old spot pork, which was chewy and overdone, and got cold right after coming out.  Honestly, I've had better prepared pork from my local butcher.  The farmer's cheese spaetzle had no cheese on it.  The steak was good, but my dad ordered it medium rare and it came out rare, practically bloody.

Pricy but without the value, and in a sort of odd location across from the old Penn ice rink, St. Declan's has much promise but based on how dead it was on a recent Saturday night, is going to have to change some things up fast to fulfill that promise.\n","\n","The decor looks like it was expensive buildout - they joined together the former sushi place with another space to make a bigger joint, with a bar on one side and a restaurant area slightly screened from the TV/bar, complete with stone pillars - and they put in nice tables and chairs. But the decor is awkward: some Irish scenes in oil paintings (see pictures) and a few knick knacks, so it's sort of a cross between your TGIFriday's ambiance and the intended neighborhood pub feel. So it's spacious, which is nice and what brought us there - good for groups, for now - but really feels weird, almost too nice and a little empty in a way. Just not your let's-go-hangout-and-get-some-color joint at all.\n","\n","The menu is a mixture of standard American bar food, a few attempts at pub food (bangers and mash, for example), and some low-end entrees (salmon, eggplant parm, et alia). The bar features a lot of single malt scotch and irish whiskeys, although I did have to explain to the server that the number next to the scotch referred to its age, not the price. (Seriously). They are quite pricy by the glass, and oddly feature more Scots than Irish labels. It's not really the place to graze authentic single malts, unless you're made of money and just don't care about trying more than a half dozen or so.\n","\n","The beer list is decent but again, a bit pricey.\n","\n","The advantage of going with a very large party, many of whom are on their Nth repeat business is you can get fair warning about the food. Basically, the sandwiches and the appetizers are fine, and the higher end entrees extremely hit or miss (\"disappointing\" was the description of our friend who was on his Nth repeat visit). So avoid the large plates and stick to the standards. Larger entrees are about $15 and up, standard sandwiches in the burger-Reuben range are $10ish, so it's not cheap.\n","\n","Service was attentive and prompt, as was the kitchen service, but done without a lot of knowledge or flair. They put up with a large group quite well (but with a number of mistakes), which, again, is what brought us there.\n","\n","It's the sort of place you're kind of rooting for but you have the sense it's not going to end well unless they gussy it up somehow - either give it character, or get the menu under control. As such it may be worth checking in on every now and then, fwiw.\n","Output: Faux Irish Pub Review\n","\n","I went to a Faux Irish pub in the city with a group of friends. We were hoping for a fun night out, but we were let down by the experience. The decor was nice, but it felt too expensive and not quite fitting for a pub.

First impression...very traditional decor with carpets decorating every part of the dimly lit rooms. Low seats and low tables. Promising.\n","\n","LOTS of food. No silverware, no flatware. Oh well lets go with it. The novelty was cool but wore off once the food that came out wasn't so finger friendly.

I developed a skill in pita scooping but still not as convenient as I would like. \n","\n","The next couple of courses were varieties of chicken, lamb couscous etc... The standard Moroccan fare. Tea, baklava and fruit for the final two courses. Some courses were definitely better than others. Doesn't matter you don't really have a choice as you get all of them. Baklava stands out in my mind though. Really enjoyed it. \n","\n","The redeeming factors here were the wine and prices. We had the wine flowing all throughout dinner and at the end of the day it was only 50 or so a person. We were all stuffed and buzzed upon exiting. Good deal.

Jones seems to be an institution, we come here at least 3-4 times a month for years. What they do well, they do well. I.E. Comfort food and milkshakes, Mac 'n cheese, cheeseburgers, brunch items are all good, albeit expensive for what it is.\n","The noise level is less than it was. I am not sure why, but perhaps the incredible turnover of servers who had to yell in order to make themselves heard, and multiple complaints from patrons may have something to do with the fact that you can actually have a reasonable conversation these days. Actually, I almost wonder whether complaints were made to OSHA about the noise levels, because they were awful. Much better now.\n","Great.\n","Not so great. Poorly trained servers. She brought me tea. Cup of hot water and teabag. No spoon, no sweetener, no offer of cream or lemon. We had to ask and there were only 3 tables full in the restaurant at the time. So it's not like it was hopping.\n","We have always loved the Cobb salad. I'm not sure what has happened to it, but mine had 2 pieces of chicken in it. My husband's may have had 3. Bacon was clumped in a big ball. I had two big bacon balls and my husband had one. Huh?\n","We told our spoon-less waitress that we were disappointed with the salads and she looked at us blankly, never asking us for details. I called her back and she listened impatiently and said she would tell her manager. On the way out, I spotted the manager and told him. He totally blew me off. Didn't even make eye contact with me. Listened (I think) impatiently while making notes and perfunctorily said he was sorry. Guess what? He wasn't. It was so obvious he could not have cared less. \n","Stephen Starr needs to visit his restaurants a bit more to supervise staff training.\n","Output: {'food': ['Cobb salad', 'Mac 'n cheese', 'Cheeseburgers', 'Brunch items'], 'drink': []}\n","<|endoftext|>\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: Upon reading the description of the 'Ziggy burger', (there was no warning of pickles) I ordered it and was disappointed.

This was great advice! The food was delicious, the experience is a lot of fun, and the price cannot be beat. (Believe me, I made a lot of phone calls when planning this dinner... nobody else even came close!)\n","\n","While the restaurant has a full bar, they also allow you to BYOB with no fee. They brought us a cooler for the wine and glasses right away and were very patient as it took quite a while for our whole group to arrive. At the beginning of the meal, your hands are washed with rosewater - this is not just a nice touch, but necessary since you'll be eating with your hands! We then enjoyed 5(+) excellent courses... the menu has stayed the same since my last visit 5 years ago, so I'll let you read other reviews for a detailed description. Suffice it to say that the food is still delicious! I am so grateful that our group spanned 2 tables, because any time there were two options we ordered one of each and shared. They were also vegetarian-friendly and provided meat-free options to the vegetarians in our group seamlessly! \n","\n","I'm so glad I made it back to this hidden gem before leaving the city.

My days started and ended with La Colombe's cappuccino, enjoyed in either the Rittenhouse Square or the cafe itself. I've found only one other cafe, Cafe Trieste in Berkeley, whose cappuccino matches La Colombe's.\n","\n","At first, I only studied at La Colombe. (To be honest, I still haven't found another cafe where I feel comfortable studying as I had at La Colombe. Must be something about their seating...) As I became a regular, I found myself drawn into intriguing conversations. La Colombe remains my dream cafe: an excellent team of baristas serving great beverages to interesting patrons studying, reading, doing crossword puzzles, drawing, and engaging in witty conversations.\n","\n","******************\n","\n","In reading the reviews thus far, it seems there has been plenty of coverage about the coffee but only mostly negative feedback for the cafe. So here's my lowdown. Decide what you will:\n","\n","*Opens and closes early: 7am-6pm ish. There are usually a handful of people already waiting at the door before the barista is ready to open. On the weekends!\n","*The baristas are amazing. The best I've seen anywhere. Incredibly efficient and fast! It helps that most patrons are regulars and know what they want. If you become a regular, the baristas will remember what you usually order and ask you if you want your usual. I varied and hence they never presumed. However, I've seen them notice regular patrons standing in line, serve up their drinks by the time the patrons reach the bar, and off the patrons simply pay and go. It reminded me of a well-choreographed dance. Tip them well if you become a regular. You may get free beverages and useful connections out of it.\n","*The baristas are all very attractive. They are all people who've other lives, for which networking at La Colombe comes in handy. They know who's who. I consider them to be, to some degree, involved in the weaving of a particular Philadelphian scene. They've never snubbed me. I've never seen them snub anyone. They've always been super professional and discrete.\n","*There is no menu. Can be intimidating for newcomers and those who like to know how much things cost. Order what you've liked elsewhere. The baristas will make most drinks people would ever want, and they'll let you know if they do not make/have a particular drink/ingredient. Just don't ask for soy milk. Skim is as far as they go. Remember, you're at a cafe owned by a Frenchman. Don't balk at the price. It'll be worth it.\n","*The iced cappuccino is crack.\n","*In terms of food, they only offer a limited quantity and variety of pastries. The almond croissants are fantastic. Less a fan of the scones. All can be gone by midday. There's a day (Mon?) when they have no pastries due to logistics. The baristas don't mind at all if you bring your own food. The regulars can be seen eating burgers from Loie's next door.\n","*Only cash.\n","*The place can get packed. Then, take your drink to go and stroll through Rittenhouse Square if you were planning on lingering. Or ask someone if you might share a table. People have always been obliging. Then, table hop when one becomes available. I've spent entire afternoons table hopping to my preferred spot or from one conversation to another.\n","*I tend to see two types of patrons: those who want conversations (i.e. are networking/socializing) and those who want to study. If you plan to study, don't sit near the front. Sit as far away from the bar and door as possible. Generally, although not always, this is where the studious sit whereas those who want conversation, the regulars, choose tables closer to the bar and the door. Invest in noise cancelling headphones, although they'll block out the music but definitely not conversations. If you're an attractive woman or man who comes regularly, the regulars will strike up conversations with you sooner or later. If you don't want that to happen, good luck.\n","*The baristas and the regulars are characters. Interesting to get to know. Consider yourself warned.\n","\n","La Colombe Cafe off Rittenhouse Square can be more than just a cafe. Your experience of La Colobme, ultimately, is what you make of it. I chose to make it one of my networks/a scene. Those who prefer otherwise need not. But I do hope you'll really appreciate its contributions to the vitality of Philadelphia.\n","Output: La Colombe Cafe is a great place to study and network, with friendly and professional baristas, attractive regulars, and delicious coffee. The cafe is a bit pricey, but worth it for the quality of the drinks and pastries. The cafe can get crowded, so be prepared to share a table or take your drink to go. The cafe is also a scene, with interesting characters and conversations.\n","<|endoftext|>\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: This place is extremely overpriced for their McDonald's equivalent food.

(Thx Yelp for help w/ the tag line ;)) My husband and I have been wanting to dine here for a while, however, a weekend reservation requires planning months in advance.  We decided on short notice to get married on a Wednesday, and thought, \"Hey, this is our opportunity to try Vetri\" and try we did!! They serve a prix fixe tasting menu that the chef selects for you.  The meal was creative and outstanding. They customize the tasting to your food preferences. My hubby and I were each served different dishes, as well as a unique wine pairing for each course. Be prepared to open the purse strings- the meal will set you back $400 for 2 ppl w/o drinks or $800 w/ a deluxe wine pairing and gratuity. The cost was $155/pp for food and the deluxe wine pairing was $135/pp (if I recall correctly, the standard wine pairing was $95/pp). If you enjoy wine, I highly recommend the pairing. The food was creative and delicious! Though I wasn't blown away by the dessert, it still gets 5 stars overall for food, service, atmosphere, etc.  I would definitely go back for a special occasion. Vetri is on par with other less expensive Philly restaurants, so it wouldn't be my first pick due to the cost.\n","Output: {'food': ['dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish', 'dish',\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: What's up, hipcityveg?

First of all the service is excellent and most of the time quick. As for the food, everything is great! The scallion pancakes are a must for an appetizer. The way they make them is so crispy and pretty lite. Their smoothies are delicious and nutritious. From observation, the way they make their mango smoothie is they cut mangoes, add ice, and blend them together. The texture is thick and the taste is sweet. As for the entrees, Empress Garden never disappoints. The Indonesian rice or lo mien is recommended. The flavor is spicy and rich. In addition, the beef soup is tasteful. Even the Americanized Chinese dishes like General Tso's chicken are delightful. One of the best General Tso's chicken is my opinion. Another plus is that the portion size is reasonable for the price. If your looking for a new place to try Empress garden is a must. It has a versatile menu for meat eaters and vegetarians, as well as those looking for a nutritious/healthy meal.\n","Output: {'food': ['scallion pancakes','mango smoothie', 'Indonesian rice or lo mien', 'beef soup', 'General Tso's chicken'], 'drink': []}\n","<|endoftext|>\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["An exception occurred for text: Instruct: Perform Named Entity Recognition to return only dish and drink items in following format \"{'food': [], 'drink': []}\" from: Visited here for brunch on  Saturday and was definitely impressed!
