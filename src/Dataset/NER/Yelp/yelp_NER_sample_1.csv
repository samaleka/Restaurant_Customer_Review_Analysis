As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me ""I guess it would be fine"" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the ""couldn't be bothered"" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. 

Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring ""last nights waiter"" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. 
I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",2015-03-05 03:37:54,"{'food': ['bacon wrapped dates', 'chocolate cake'], 'drink': ['cocktails']}"

I was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes. 

We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.

For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.

One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late).

All were pretty good. Definitely satisfied the ice cream craving. I thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker, same goes for the chocolate.

No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums. 

My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.

To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience.

The Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. 

The fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries

The onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). 

Spanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good

Baklava - VERY GOOD! 

Signature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!

The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki.

Today while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant.

I love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.

My husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.

I was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.

Lunch has been very strange for me since HipCity opened. Because here's the thing: I am a meat eater. I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or, just maybe, the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.

Haven't had everything on the menu yet, but everything I have had has been great.

The groothie is also delicious, and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.

Okay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly, and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.

My only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door.

Service was sufficient for dinner.  We tried the mac and cheese appetizer that had just the right amount of breadcrumbs on it.  It was served hot, but with average taste.  We also tried the cheeseteak egg rolls - decent, but not a lot of meat in them.  Some of the bites I had of the egg roll were merely the fried dough without getting to any of the cheese and meat.   They were served with ketchup and a special mustard that had some horseradish in it for a bit of a kick!  I must say, it is a neat thing for a Philadelphia Pub to have on a menu.  

For our main entrees, we both had the chicken pot pie.  The vegetables were plentiful, and the chicken was all white meat, though there was not that much of it.  The crust was somewhat flaky, but there was a section of my pot pie crust that didn't seem like it was cooked all the way through.  

Dessert portion sizes were huge!  We had the bread pudding which was average in taste, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was served ala mode with vanilla ice cream as well.

Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.
But whats this? 
There are whispers that he no longer cooks for ""Best Taste of Asia,"" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.

No.
No, it can't be! 
I need to score - one .. final .. hit..

Life ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?
Why am I here?
What is Cheeze Wiz?
Its done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.

Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. 

Zaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.
 
I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.

The menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.
Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. 
The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.

I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.

The bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for ""Best taste of Asia,"" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. 

Only good things can come of this, only good things.

P.S.
ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. 
However, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available.

The chicken (breast, wing, thigh, drumstick) is drizzled with lavender honey and sprinkled with salt and ground pink peppercorns.

Please allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. 

As my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to ""make me something awesome with whiskey in it."" ""What kind of drink do you want?,"" he inquired. ""I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these."" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the ""The Commodore"" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.

When our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.

Warning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. 

All in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.

Still dreaming of that burger,

I got the slammin' salmon and my wife got the crunch. I'd say they both definitely had fresh ingredients, and definitely tasted fresh, but I think the balance of flavors wasn't quite right for the slammin' salmon. Way too heavy on the sauce, completely overpowering the crisp fresh veggies and salmon. 

We tried the Japanese fried chicken. Sauce is a little sweet and sour. And the chicken was a little dry. 

We also tried their green tea and lemonade, which were pretty good, but you don't come to a place like this because their green tea and lemonade are their best things on the menu. 

Overall, you pay a high premium for a gimmicky meal. With this location being essentially at a revolving door of new customers on the corner of Penn's campus, I think they have the potential to do well. But I don't think I'll be coming back. We'll take our $34 elsewhere.",2015-03-05 01:59:10,

I found myself in the area again and decided to give it a try. I usually don't write reviews until I've been to a place a few times but I think my experience was a complete one. I ordered the special and sampled each type of chicken, the modern BBQ sauce, mac&cheese (which the woman behind the counter was very proud of), 
a bananas foster pie, and the new hope birch beer. After finishing everything, I just wanted my $16.20 back. Individual reviews: 

The chicken: It was very average and that is being generous. It wasn't incredibly flavorful but it wasn't dry so it could have been worse. 

The sauce: It had the tang of a traditional North Carolina BBQ sauce, mustard and vinegar based. I can't eat mayo so I was limited with sauce choices but the mayo sauces were recommended. 

The mac&cheese: Salty and mediocre. It combines all of the things I like but makes a mess doing it. The pasta was well cooked but the cheese and bacon combo made it taste like I just licked salt off of my hand without the nice shot of tequila after. 

The bananas foster pie: The crust of the pie needs no improvement but the filling could use an overhaul. I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. 

The new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.

I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because nothing was horrible.  I think the concept works, the decor is nice, and the menu is good but they need to work on the quality of their food because it currently doesn't match the cost.",2014-05-07 20:24:38,"{'food': ['chicken', 'mac&cheese', 'bananas foster pie'], 'drink': ['new hope birch beer']}"

I got ""the veg"" and the spicy fries.  ""The veg"" is a portabella burger, with grilled mozzarella, picked veg, arugula, and gauc.  Wholly non-cow is this thing spectacular for a bella burger!  The bella is on bottom, then the mozzarella is directly fused on top of that.  I actually thought the cheese was halloumi at first because it wasn't super melted (a good thing). The gauc and pickled veg are slightly citrusy and vinegary, but are contrasted by the bitterness of the arugula.  There's a nice bun to contents ratio, and for bonus points it's a potato bun.

Wasn't sure what to expect with the spicy fries going in - are they hot sauce fries, etc?  Turns out they are of the crab-fries variety with some subtle other spices added in.  Nice portion - not too big.

Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). 

I've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The ""onion rings"" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!

Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (""Cookie Jar"" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.

Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there.

Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions .

The two things I will surely go back for more of is the Sausage and Pepper Pizza (capitalized - because I mean business) and some sort of puff pastry that has a white cream in the middle - I'm sure it has a name but it escapes me.  The pizza was perfectly flavored and the sausage/peppers had a nice kick to it.  Im sure it would make for great leftovers but unfortunately (fortunately?) for me it was gone well before it found the refrigerator.  The cream puff cream was just awesome - couldn't pin-point the flavor (vanilla?) but I would prefer it to top every dessert I get from this point forward.

I also got a bunch of the other sweets (salted brownie, blondie, red velvet crumb-cake) and a few bagels.  All were good, but not great.  Was pleasantly surprised by the wheat everything bagels - whole wheat bagels usually suck.

What I didn't really like was the pepperoni pizza.  It was pretty bland for my liking - in complete contrast to the sausage and pepper pizza - and the pepperoni was pretty sparse. I also didn't like being told 25 minutes, showing up in 25 minutes and then standing there for 25 minutes waiting for the pizza.  The small shop + no chairs = awkwardly standing there for almost a half hour.  

Since it's close to me and has so many tasty looking treats yet to try - I'll surely be back.  Hopefully I'll get more 'great' than 'so-so'.",2013-09-04 00:55:48,"{'food': ['Sausage and Pepper Pizza', 'Wheat Everything Bagels'], 'drink': []}"

The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like ""why are you here. I have better things to do""?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just ""Hey man, what can I get ya?""  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, ""We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?"". The manager says ""Sure."" The guy then says, ""Can we get few beers down here""? (paraphrasing). The bartender says ""Sure!"" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, ""Hey, just shout and I will get you something"", or ""Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you"". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! 

Long story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it.

But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend, I trusted their better judgement.  In the end, I'm glad I did.  This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say, a contender for the best) brunch in Philly, the staff really make you feel at home.  They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food, delightful presentation, and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains.

Their specialty, and they're not shy to tell you, is the Cyprus Breakfast.  It's a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs, meat, and starch.  The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs, fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely.  It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham), two pieces of salty, crisp fried halloumi, warm bread, and tomato, cucumber, and onion salad.  The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono, Moussaka, Pastitsio, Shaksouka, and Malohwa to name a few.  They even serve Greek Coffee and Frappes!

The service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome, but it's much appreciated, especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food.  One other tip: reservations are highly recommended, if not required.  Because of Kanella's small space, getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list.

I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. 

I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... 

The guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entrée had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. 

I should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  

The prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.

Every Valentine's Day I try to find some cute, new little BYO for me and my boyfriend to try out and I spend weeks scouring menus and Yelp reviews. 

Every year SOMETHING goes wrong and I get frustrated and pissed off and he always says ""Let's go to Jones"".

This year was no different. We went out last night (2/12/11...the weekend before Valentines Day) to the BYO I picked out and when I made our reservations, no mention was made that they had a special fixed menu that night consisting SOLELY of seafood, which I am allergic to. As I started to get upset at our table, my boyfriend said ""Let's go to Jones"".

We got there, were told there was a little bit of a wait, so we sat at the bar for a drink. About 5-10 minutes later they came and got us and sat us at our table. Our waiter (who was WONDERFUL and looked like Jared Leto - extra bonus-) came over and took our order and the food came out perfectly (as usual) and right on time.

The ATMS are no surcharge (yes!!!)
They place really, really cool music!

(OK, so I just glanced over at Simon E.'s review of this same WaWa and he says the vibe is upbeat, and that is def. true!  Friendly staff who seem happy to work there!  And getting a wave in the ALWAYS packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence.)

Gripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  

Gripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.

Major points for:  
*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  
*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!
*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks/protein bars, drinks, etc.
*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!
*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.

I do not eat any of the hot food.  Low quality, I steer clear.  


For a convenience store that is open 24 hours, WaWa is awesome!  

Does this one have a bathroom?  I never used it, I never checked....but maybe there is no bathroom for customers there!  Maybe it is around back?  Hmmm.  I would avoid using it anyway.  
Also, this WaWa could never have gas pumps, traffic is already congested between Allens Lane and Mt. Airy Avenue along Germantown Ave.  (Between WaWa and the Bank of America on the corner.)

I walked in to Cactus this Monday with a friend from work, and the bartender had a pitcher of 'ritas going before we even sat down. Point to Cactus: The staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers.

The service can be a little slow at times, but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful. The 'ritas themselves aren't the most consistent (this week's were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 I'm not complaining. And, to reply to one of the posts, they definitely don't skimp on the tequila. In fact, the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher.

So, the food: if you have it on the menu, you better have it in the kitchen. They were missing a few things which was very disapponting. We shared the scallops which were the best part of the meal- but for $3.33/scallop it better be good. I settled for the salman which was nothing special (salmon is usually a fail safe for me, I always get it if nothing else jumps out at me on the menu- so I've had a lot of salmon throughtout my life.) It was accompanied by heavily peppered carrots & green beans and a ""root puree"" which was just a fancy way of saying mashed potatoes.... which was a tease because I was expecting sweet potato, parsnips or SOMETHING better than a root vegetable I am already fully aware of. Drinks were decent: my bf had a bourbon/cherry martini & I had my favorite- a dry, dirty grey goose martini. Hard to mess those up , though.

I work nearby so I have ordered here many times. I recently learned that there was an online ordering option, which I thought would be perfect because I am busy throughout the entire day with appointments and don't have a lot of time to wait and order at Cosi, especially during their busy hours.

A couple times I have online ordered there were no issues. My food was ready when it was supposed to be, and I was able to avoid the long lines. The other times, the service was horrible. When you online order, the estimated wait is always 20 minutes. I always give Cosi 25-30 minutes to make sure everything is ready so I can just pick it up after prepaying online. A few times I have had to wait 50 minutes total from when I online ordered because the employees did not look at the online orders as they were coming in to prepare them. My question is, what is the point of online ordering if it takes longer to get your food when you online order than when you walk in?

Today I online ordered from Cosi. Not only was my order not ready after 30 minutes, but the service was horrible and the employees were incompetent. I went through the normal line and told the employees I online ordered. The employee, without checking my online order receipt that they should have already looked at, asked me what I got because they clearly had not made my order yet. I was ordering for multiple people so I told him I couldn't remember, so he went in the back to get my order receipt which is what he should've done earlier. I ordered coffees so I went to the coffee counter while I was waiting for my order to be prepared. There was an employee busy preparing someone else's order so I stood there waiting. An employee from another register asked if she could help me. I told her that I had 2 coffees with my online order. She then said okay and just STOOD THERE. I had to ask her, ""So should I just go back to the register I was just at and wait for someone to help me with my coffee?"" She said yes as she continued to stand there not doing anything. So I went back to the original register I was at and the woman who was still busy preparing an order asked me what I needed. I told her that I ordered 2 coffees. She then asked the employee who I had just talked to and was not doing anything to prepare the 2 coffees! The employee who was now helping me did not understand the coffee sizes. The coffee sizes online are grande and gigante, and she didn't know what those meant. Don't use those coffee size names if your employees don't even know what they mean. In the meantime, the person who was preparing my food order had to come ask me again what I ordered while showing me my order receipt. He clearly did not know how to read the order receipt, which honestly a 1st grader could understand. He asked me if I ordered 2 squagels, and I said yeah that's what the online receipt you are showing me says.

Mainly because most people have at best, two reference points for donuts, Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. Neither of which really makes truly great donuts.  So after waiting for the crowds to die down a little, I traveled over to see for myself last Saturday.

It's a small shop that blends into the surrounding neighborhood. Inside there are a couple of seats at the counter and a wide window well that two people could sit in. I ordered my donuts. I went with the Indian Cinnamon, the caramel banana, the pina colada, and the halva pistachio. The ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in. My order was processed quickly, and I got my coffee right after I ordered it. The coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating.

 Since there was no room to sit, much less stand I took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of Federal between 3rd and 4th St.
The donuts were truly transcendant.  Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.

The Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon, coated with sugar. Hot, fresh, and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.

The caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I""d imagined.

The pina colada-The donut I though I'd enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven's 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations, I don't use that term lightly.

The halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well. I'd never had halva before, but I liked it.

Having had a date last Saturday, I thought it would have been a good opportunity to try it out. 
The layout of the restaurant left some to be desired, as the host stand is at the back, and the place is very small save for the upstairs, but they were able to sit us almost immediately in the upstairs dining room which was small, yet charming, and slightly more roomy. A gentleman who I am guessing was the co-owner was very friendly and ensured our 8:00 reservation was filled and the wine poured. The service wasn't slow, though awkward. It seemed that our server was there when we didn't need her, yet not there when we did, though she had a very friendly demeanor and was not rushing us in the least.
The food was delicious, though a few things stood out to me as peculiar, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. This was a legit Italian restaurant, yet they had ravioli as an antipasto. Anybody who knows Italian knows this means ""before"" the pasta, not the pasta itself. Secondly, the bread, which was very good, came with butter, and not Olive Oil. Again, this was an Italian restaurant, not an Applebee's. 
For our appetizer we ordered eggplant, which was okay. Was sliced a bit too thin, though this may have been personal preference, but in doing so was masked by the (delicious) red gravy and (addictive) mozzarella, which was very fresh, so while I may not have been tasting the eggplant, I was tasting some very delicious flavors. 
Our main courses came in due time afterwards, enough to let our eggplant digest, but not enough time to make us forget. I ordered the special, linguine in a light vodka cream sauce with salmon and capers, my date ordered the canneloni. Both were inspired. Not the gigantic portions known to most frequent Italian restaurant goers in Philadelphia, but just enough. The flavors were subtle, yet plentiful. 
We did skip dessert in favor of coffee. I ordered a double espresso, my date a cappucino (I know, but she was cute, so it's okay). The waittress came out with a regular and double cappucino. Wasn't the end of the world, so I just enjoyed it, and it was good, but just speak up if you want an espresso.

We were pretty pumped to go here since we live right down the street and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Fat Ham a few weeks ago.  The food was good but not show stopping.

This place underwhelmed and now I have to deal with my fiancé who is still raging with last nights experience.  Thanks Spraga.

Issues:
1.  Soups came before cocktails.  I finally had to ask a manager where our cocktails we're because it so long.  - not in my world if I'm paying $180!  
2.  First course came while we were still eating our soup..so we had 2 plates in front of us on a cramped table.  Hello serving 101 at like the most basic restaurant in the world..Don't bring the next course when people are still eating their first!  Again I would expect shit like this to happen if I were at TGI Fridays but I wasn't at TGI Fridays.  I was at SPRAGA.
4. The waiter tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them.  Say what?  Not when I'm paying $180 on a meal son!  You leave the plate until I am finished!
5.  The waiter would awkwardly come to the table and just stand there.. Obviously we know he came to take our food order or dessert order but you say "" Is everyone ready?.. I'd like to take your order"" etc.  WTF.  Nope he just stood there... Weird!

My wife and I arrived at 8:00pm and was told there was a 2 hour wait.  I read reviews prior to arriving so I was prepared to wait.  I was still a little surprised at how small this place is.  We decided to wait around by the bar.  After waiting for roughly 25 minutes, a spot opened up at a sit down counter, adjacent to the bar.  

For starters, we ordered the pickled red and golden beets along with turnips and black kale from their pickled section.  We liked the pickled beets but the turnips and black kale surprisingly where our favorite.  The acidity was mild and the black kale was crisp.  The toppings I ordered on my burger were Rogue Smokey Bleu, caramelized onions, bacon, and a fried egg.  I had high expectations for my burger and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked to perfection.  I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor.  I was underwhelmed with the duck fat French fries.  They were okay, but nothing exceptional to me. The S'more milk shake was excellent!  The homemade marshmallow had all the characteristics and nuances of their camp fire cousins.

I've been to the Capital Grill and I enjoy their beef as well as their service and decor, I just didn't want to spend $250.00 + for the 3 of us (call me cheap).  Not really knowing what to expect at the Marmont, we took a risk.  

The Good:
I have to say that the NY strip steaks and rib eye were very very good and cooked perfectly (medium rare and medium).  They were about 1-1/2 thick (forgot to bring my calipers) and well trimmed; very little fat was left. I would say the meat was prime, not choice.  We all enjoyed them as well as the fries which were cooked crisply as we requested.  the sauces were meh; why cover up the wonderful taste of the beef?  Service was good, prompt, and polite.   

The Not So Good:
The decor is awful.  The floor looks like painted OSB with the paint half worn off, the tables are painted plywood, lighting from K-Mart, and walls have a few giant old signs hanging on them.  The place is a visual dive. I felt like I was in a Tom Waits song.  How hard would it be to make it a nice warm and inviting space? I don't get it.   Want to make more money? Spend the 5K, it will pay off. But please find someone who knows what they are doing.  You serve delicious steaks; I'll bet your decorator doesn't do the cooking, so why ask the cook to decorate?

The people that work at Spot were very friendly and helpful. They explained the specials and helped us with suggestions. I was surprised that Spot has other items such as Fish & Chips and Muscles in addition to burgers, sloppy Joe's, pulled pork and cheese steaks. Mental notes for my next visit.

I went with the Spot burger; which had hickory smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles, coleslaw and Spot sauce. This was a great burger. The bun was excellent, fresh and toasted just right.  The burger was moist and juicy. The bacon was great and the slaw and sauce really made this one darn tasty burger.

Salt and pepper chicken wings- Very good, not quite as fried/crispy as other places' salt baked wings, but still good.

Scallion pancake- Very good. Fluffier than most places I usually have it. They serve it with a sweeter sauce. I think it tastes better with soy based sauces.

Taiwanese beef noodle soup- Delicious. Very flavorful broth. Noodles are really good. My only complaint is that they should cut up the beef into smaller pieces. The beef portion in the soup is generous, but I'm trying to eat soup, not a steak.

Beef chow fun- Pretty good, a little glutinous for my taste. I like the noodles a bit wetter in sauce. Beef portion is solid.

Service is fine and friendly. Their English isn't great, but it's fine. I did have to explain several times that I wanted the rest of my food wrapped up to go.

On saturday I went with a group of 7 people. Since Honeys is one of our favorite places to get brunch, we knew that we would have to wait up to an hour for a table. Since they have such good food, it's worth it.

But this is why I'm no longer going to go there, and the reason for the two star rating:

The hostess was horrible. There is only ONE table that can seat up to 8 people. We went in, she told us that the previous party has been sitting there for a while and would be done at any minuet. She also told us that we would be the next people to sit down. We thought, great! since they were putting on their coats and getting ready to leave.

After the staff was finished cleaning up the dishes from the table, the host sat down A PARTY OF THREE PEOPLE. that also, CAME AFTER US!!! I just don't get it. There were plenty of other tables available, so why sit a party of 3 at the only table that can comfortably sit 8? 

I understand going to Honey's with a party of 7 isnt the smartest idea, but when the hostess tells us that we would be next in line for that large table,and then sits 3 people, that is the dumbest thing ever.

I've been excited to know a Top Chef winner has opened up a restaurant a few blocks down my place but I haven't gone for months because I felt somewhat intimidated. The price is of course a little higher and I've always had a distaste for restaurant that only offers taste and not fulfillment. So when it was a few days before X'mas and the few restaurant newsletter ever so ""gently"" reminded me that the New Year's Eve dinner is actually a big deal, I started soul searching for a restaurant that I always wanted to try but haven't had a chance to do so, my mind landed on Sbraga.

The place has the very same decor that the hipper restaurants in Philly and New York favors, walls lined with wood planks, the very urban wood cabin feel. Silver and black balloons filled up the ceiling for NYE, the place was packed with people. 

On New Year's Eve, they offered a 4-course champagne menu. While it is nice, it's 3-times more expensive with no selection whatsoever and I'm a light-weight drinker, and it was early and I like to choose, so we opted for the regular four-course menu.

I indulged in the rich and surprisingly sweet Foie Gras Soup. It's velvety, almost like a sabayon. For the second course, I had the Sea Bream which I recommend the dish wholeheartedly. The Sea Bream has a really crispy skin, the fish is well cooked. The same can be said about the piece of pork belly in the dish. I also love the squid ink sauce and the calamari ""noodles"". Love it. would eat it again, would even try to make it in my own kitchen. For the third course, I had the fettucine with the perfectly cooked 62 degrees egg. the egg is indeed perfectly cooked, but it's not much different from a pasta carbonara. Maybe even less, since the amount of pasta is little and the dish is recommended to be mixed up, the pasta to egg sauce ratio is a little out of whack. The whole dish is a little more ""decomposed"" than I like it to be. The churro/coffee creme brulee is a nice finish to the meal. 

I wish that the whole meal is more filling, but at the end it wasn't too bad. Me and my friend was debating whether we wanted a sandwich after the meal, but it was fine. Service was good, our server is charming even though he spilled some water. I had a Sbraga Punch which to me tasted very much like cough syrup and he had no problem switching it to the Bell Hop for me which was quite unique and pleasant. Being sat right next to the kitchen also has its perks, other than being right in Sbraga's face, occasionally you'll hear they yell ""Service!"" which it's almost like they're putting on a show for you before you hear it enough and you wonder whether they are having problems with their wait staff. The couple next to us were obviously not a Top Chef fan, since their waitress told them that she'll ""relay their compliments to Kevin"" and they were murmuring to themselves that they had no idea who Kevin was.

Will I go back? I would probably, if a friend hasn't been and suggest to go. Personally, I still like to have a meal that fills me up, especially if I have to pay almost $100 per person.",2013-01-03 18:04:53,"{'food': ['Foie Gras Soup', 'Sea Bream', 'Pork Belly', 'Squid Ink Sauce', 'Calamari Noodles'], 'drink': ['Bell Hop']}"

I've been here twice but both were absolutely incredible dining experiences. Both times I visited were during brunch hours so my reviews will be based on that menu. 

My first bit of advice is, if you haven't been before and want to know what to order, the answer is the Cyprus Breakfast. This meal, and it is quite filling, has everything you could want for a brunch. Two extra crispy fried eggs, a big slab of ham, two pieces of a fried Mediterranean cheese, some delicious bread and a salad, all together on one glorious plate. My fiancé and I both ordered each time we went because it is that good!  This past trip, I also ordered the lamb sandwich, which was also amazing. Large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll.  Another menu item I'm dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special. The way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach. For dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko. I know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala they'll know what you mean. It's a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom, drizzled in orange infused syrup. It's outstanding. 

Kanella is special because of more than just the food. They have an amazing staff. We had the same young waiter both times we went. He was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Usually you don't remember the waiter and if you do, it's never for good reasons. The service here actually enhances the experience. On top of that, there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating.

Han Dynasty serves food in very large, family sized portions.  It's most fun when you are with a bit of a group, so you can order a number of different things, and try them all.

On their ""specials"" menu, they have Spicy Aroma Fish which is just absolutely beyond this world.  SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans, so we get shrimp as the protein, but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.

They have numbers on the menu, 1-10, beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It's really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn't the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong, but it's all flavor.  

Dry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.

Several reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful, but they are indeed rather oily.  It's just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared, one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.  

Absolute top notch rating for this place.  Love it!",2015-04-01 15:55:54,"{'food': ['Spicy Aroma Fish', 'Dry pot style'], 'drink': []}"

We liked the idea of ordering a bunch of small plates to share.  It didn't disappoint--everything was delicious and lovingly presented.  We ended up ordering the goat cheese and basil bruschetta (mild but tasty); figs stuffed with blue cheese and served over prosciutto (rich and pungent); calimari (which I didn't try); fennel sausage (tender and flavorful); two of the cheeses (one was an amazing triple creme; can't remember the other one); and the chocolate torte.  The cheeses (which are listed on a separate part of the menu--make sure not to overlook them!) are served with sliced bread and are paired with various toppings.  Ours came with fresh honey and some kind of tapenade.       

It's somewhat pricey but not exorbitant, which we had anticipated.  The bill came to $80 for five small plates, a cheese board with two cheeses, and two glasses of wine (i.e., a moderate amount of food for dinner for two people).  You could obviously tweak this depending on your appetite, your budget, or your mood.  It would be a great place to just drop in for a snack. 

We ate at one of the cafe tables on the sidewalk, which made for a really pleasant evening.  The service was good but was attentive to the point of being slightly overbearing.

Total slime balls!!

Note: there are no prices listed on the truck.  (At least not during the 2nd Street Festival in NoLibs.)

My friend went there and ordered the fried chicken platter with an extra side of yams.  The guy working there told him it would be $14 for the platter and $2 for the side.  He said ok, I'll be right back and left to go pick something up really quickly.

He comes back to pick up the food and forks over a $20 bill for he order.  They take it and he asks for his change.  (Should be $4.)  Instead of giving him his change back, they tell him it is $20 - $16 for the platter and $4 for the side.  (Sudden price increase?!?!)

My friend argues with them briefly and tells him that isn't what they agreed to before and he just wants the change.  The guy refuses so my friend leaves, having paid an extra $4.

Bottom line: don't eat here!  They're dishonest and completely rude.

Oh, and on top of that, the food was bland.  Spent $20 for bland food.  Shame.

We had a very nice (very obviously not Ethiopian) waitress with multiple visible piercings.  She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she's not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I'm jealous!  

As is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one's hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two ""stalls"" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!

When the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia's injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I'm not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It's a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.   

The dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.

Plus, if you find a purple center in your cupcake, you can get another one for free. (Definitely NOT a marketing scheme, but I admire the game even though we're being played.)

To get to the point: the first thing I tried was the icing.. it was literally so hard I had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite. I feel like I would've like it if it was softer and more like icing? The chocolate cake was like any other. My fiancée's cupcake was strange!! The icing literally tasted like stale, natural butter (or maybe more closely similar to lard!? If you ever tasted lard, you'll know that distinct flavor it has.) The icing was also hard as a rock.

What?  An hour+ for three sandwiches?  They said they were slammed.  We could see three open tables outside and two other tables seated after us had already received food.  Lots of ""I'm sorries"" from the wait staff.  We insisted on a complimentary round of drinks (which they did agree to).

When the food finally came, the Roast Pork sandwich and fries were completely cold (guess that was the half that was done on time).  The pork was fine, but the roll just average and the gravy was awful.  Fries, meh.  Cheese Steak filling looked like ground beef and was a miniscule portion in a large grinder roll.

Out of probably 200 sushi bars I have been to, there are only 9 places in the world that I have been to that meet my criteria to be called a ""good"" sushi bar. Three are in Japan, 2 are in Los Angeles, 1 is in San Francisco, 2 are in New York, and then there's this place in sh*tty old Philadelphia, a 5 minute cab ride from my apartment in Center city. Izumi is nothing short of excellent in every way.
Any good food starts out with good ingredients. Making good traditional sushi is very simple: use good quality rice, prepared properly, excellent fish, and a dab of some good home-made ""wasabi"". Most places suck at all or some of these things. Not this place.
Small restaurant with maybe 4 staffers including one in the front-of-house. Hardest working people in the restaurant industry, those FOH guys. Probably only 30-35 seats, but when the place is full, they are running around like crazy, serving food, taking orders, busing tables, and seating new parties. The wait can be long, but it is worth it.
All of the fish I have had there (virtually every fish on the menu) has been perfect as sashimi and sushi, and their maki rolls are good as well. Special shout-outs for the tuna, salmon, super-white tuna (don't eat too much because of high wax content and digestive issues), and the oh toro. All are excellent in texture, quality, taste, and preparation. If you like spicy tuna rolls, you won't eat them again at your local neighborhood sushi joint. Each order is prepared individually from a filet of tuna scraped with a spoon. There's no giant tub of tuna scraps in the back mixed with mayo and a little sririacha served all day. 

The good food doesn't stop at the sushi, though. Their slow roasted beef shortrib is nothing short of ""oh-my-goodness this is amazing"".

- The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.

- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?

- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.

- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.

- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.

EDIT:

- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.

- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice.",2014-01-17 21:10:17,"{'food': ['Dan Dan noodles', 'dumplings', 'entree'], 'drink': ['water', 'tea']}"

I dined here on a Saturday evening and ordered the four course tasting menu with some friends. We were seated promptly and the service was great. I ordered the fried green tomatoes with smoked shortbreads and cumin aioli, sea bream with rustic bread salad and hummus, meatloaf with bacon marmalade and the chocolate mousse taste with pistachio ice cream. My first two courses were excellent. It was my first time eating shortbreads, and I was pleasantly surprised. The sea bream dish was light and very tasty. However, I felt things fell short with the meat course and the dessert. The texture of the meatloaf was too crumbly, and I think I prefer my meatloaf to be a little more solid. It also seems that they included olives in their bacon marmalade and the taste of the marmalade was just too vinegary for me. And as for the dessert, it was just ok.

This is a fast, spacious, bright, comfortable, spotlessly clean, well managed, counter-service local Vietnamese chain (also locations in Bryn Mawr and Springfield, Montgo. Co.). They take your order via touchscreen and serve reliable Vietnamese standards: pho, bun (vermicelli), banh mi, and broken rice plates. Service is friendly and speedy. Portions are on the large side. It's a little more expensive than the Viet dining options you would find on Washington Ave., but you're paying for convenience and speed. The pho is delicious, the vermicelli servings are generous and topped with crunchy fried shallots, and the banh mi are stuffed full of crunchy, brightly colored carrots and veggies. You can add on typical toppings like sriracha, hoisin, nuoc cham (fish sauce), and crushed peanuts. Everything looks even better in real life than on the touchscreen menus. Even if there's a bit of wait, it's still quick and definitely worth it.

This is a such a dependably tasty place to go for lunch, if you're anywhere near JFK Blvd. or Market, or on the west side of Center City, or even if you're visiting from out of town and walking up to the Parkway from the Rittenhouse area. For folks who live in CC or Fairmount, it's conveniently located across from Trader Joe's and easy to get to in just a few minutes by trolley from University City or West Philly. Thank God they opened a Center City location. I could pretty much stand to eat lunch here every day!

Its location is convenient for daytime Vietnamese eats, but it would be awesome if a Vietnamese place like this were open during late-night hours around the 13th St. corridor, on the east side of Center City, or within walking distance of Center City bars.

They claim to serve Mexican and Texas food, on a somewhat authentic basis. This is not true. I've never seen plantains on a taco in a Mexican restaurant in Texas. Also, Texas barbecue is largely smoked brisket served sans bacon in a sandwich. Or taco. Simply having Texas toast and Tequila (albeit a fabulous selection) does not make you an authentic Texas or Mexican food establishment. And plantains certainly don't. 

Plus, their customer service hasn't been good after going there three separate times. Each time and shift, the manager has been dismissive and the waiter or waitress has been over-worked. Which is why I wasn't too upset that after 20 minutes of having no ice tea refilled, I wasn't upset when I got attitude from my waitress when I finally saw her to ask.

At first, I thought it was a farmers market. I texted my friend asking her what time we should go so I knew when to cook dinner and she told me to hold off dinner - I was going to get stuffed at this event.

She was dead wrong.

When we arrived around 7:30 we found it super packed. Long long times, tight crowds, lots of dogs and babies. We circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in, and decided on the Jamaican truck. After an hour of standing in line, and having other line go-ers friends casually jip us, we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options.

So you know what I had for dinner the evening of Night Market? A bag of chips from CVS.

This event had it's potential. But I guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people. Most trucks were placing ""SOLD OUT"" signs just as we were arriving.

The sea weed salad was nasty - although I felt like the waiter prepared us for the - others must have complained. The ginger chicken took a long time to cook but I am not sure why as when it came out it was still pink.  The flavor was ok but for $21 I would have expected to get more than an appetizer size portion of chicken. It was accompanied by a risotto which was flavored as salt.

Luck smiled on my party of three, as we snagged a last-minute reservation at noon (you should plan further in advance than we did). I echo other reviewers' sentiments concerning the decor at Kanella; as I walked in, the antique exposed brick and blue/white color scheme tempoarily transported me back to the Cycladic Islands. Chef Pitsillides kept the illusion going with his typically Mediterranean hospitality. He checked on our table thrice to make sure we felt welcomed, and indeed the constant attention and care we received has earned Kanella a return visit on that merit alone.

That isn't to downplay his Cypriot fare; the food is absolutely delicious. One can only indulge in so many variations of french toast or eggs benedict before growing bored, and Kanella's vibrant, rustic plates certainly enliven the palette and restore one's faith in brunch. We commenced our meal with the obligatory dip trio, which served up pumpkin-feta, spicy tomato, and white bean dips in lieu of the stereotypical hummus and baba. Each scored high marks from the table, with the pumpkin cruising into first with an interesting briny-earthy-sweet interplay. 

Other dishes ordered included the baked duck egg, potatoes with tzatziki, and a special lamb tongue stew. Though small in portion, the duck egg showed deft execution with a crispy but ever-so-slightly-creamy fried egg crowning well-seasoned, toothsome greens in yogurt sauce. The potatoes had a similarly crisp texture with fluffy innards, and paired beautifully with accompanying minty, rich tzatziki. The tongue stew offered a heaping plate of creamy giant beans and tender, pleasantly funky lamb tongue pieces in a vibrantly flavored sauce. With a squeeze of lemon juice, a dollop of accompanying Greek yogurt, and a last-minute side order of extra grilled pita, the dish served as a hearty, memorable combination of flavors and textures.

For a change of pace in the Philly dining scene, or simply for Chef Pitsillides welcoming demeanor and crazy-good plates, head to Kanella and get whisked away to the Aegean for an hour or so.",2013-10-15 18:34:34,

It is actually quite complex and involves solid negotiating and compromising skills with your fellow table-mates to ensure that you get a bite of everything you wanted to try!

For the first course I got the Foie Gras soup.  Unless you have some animal rights hang-up about it - you should get the soup.  It's probably the best soup I've ever had.  I also tried the pork belly.  It was just okay - almost like a pork belly carpaccio (in texture and thickness).  

The second course I had the calamari.  In my head I was thinking crispy calamari - just because that's the only calamari I've ever had.  These were large calamari with an almost scallop texture to them.  The salsa verde was good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the calamari itself.  Also tried the salmon which was good - not great.  

For the third course I had the meatloaf - it was excellent.  Perfectly tender and seasoned.  I also had some of the pasta someone got - it was also very good.

For dessert I had the pistachio bread putting which was a deconstructed dessert with the ingredients all separated on the plate.  It both looked stellar and was tasty.

Surprisingly - I felt full despite the rather small portions.  All in all there were some excellent dishes (get the soup I tell you!) - but there were also a couple 'so-so' dishes.

I was told by all my Philly friends that I had to go here for crab fries when I was town.  Friday night during the Phillies game we went to Chickie's and Pete's, we were immediately seated at a two top table.  While delivering our beers and crab fries, the server asked us if we were ready to order.  We explained that we would be there for the game and we were pacing ourselves and her response was ""the whole game, well you better be constantly ordering if you are going to take up my table.""  I totally understand her concern, and we assured her that we would in fact be ordering beers and food throughout the game.

A few moments later she walked through her section complaining and cussing about the $1.00 tip she received from her table, again, I understand her concern, but there is a time and a place.  She then cleared a table and came to take the order of the people next to us, and placed the dirty plate of shrimp peels on the table, gross.  While our beers sat empty she sat down a few tables near us and had a 10 minute conversation with her friends that were dining there.  Another table sat down and again we heard the same speech about not talking up her tables and that they had to order all night (glad it wasn't just us).  At this point, our beers had been empty for 20 minutes.  

My friend went over to the bar, found 2 empty chairs and I asked her for our check.  She knew we had planned to stay all night and asked why we were leaving, and I was happy to tell her that we were not going to take up her table.  Our check was $14.00 and I left $24.00 hoping that she would take that act of kindness and extend it to the poor patrons who had to deal with her next.

Now.... Onto the experience at the bar... TOTALLY AMAZING.  The bar staff that was working on Friday 4/19/13 made our night.

The falafel sandwich that took its place was served on a rather hard bun, rather than traditional pita, which smushed the falafel as you ate and generally overwhelmed the flavors of the tzatziki sauce. (There are plenty of delicious falafel spots in the area that quite simply do it better.)

The drop in rating comes from the ""Express Lunch"" taking 45 minutes to get to the table (we had 8 people, most of whom ordered the Express Lunch, assuming it would be quicker than the regular menu). 45 minutes is not express and not at all useful when lunching on a time limit. It would've been nice if the server had noted that because Express Lunches are served all 3 courses together, they do not come out as prepared (they're held under a heating lamp till all pieces are ready) and therefore it might be faster for a large group to order off the regular menu. We saw other groups (including some of our colleagues) come and go in the time it took for us to get our food.

Village Whiskey's biggest weakness is actually its high price. Taste-wise, my medium-rare burger with goat cheese and egg is comparable to BBP or 500 Degrees. The meat and egg were prepared the way I like it, and the toppings were of high quality, especially the cheese. (Note that the egg yolk is runny! If you don't like that or are afraid of salmonella, let them know.) The only thing I did not like as much was how heavily the hamburger buns were buttered. That was just a little bit too much for my taste, but I know many people who would love the slightly sweet, buttery bun. However, the burger I got was 16 dollars (11 for the burger, 3.50 for the cheese and 1.50 for the egg), which is exactly the price of the burger at Craigie on Main. In case you don't frequent Boston as much, Craigie's is a 'real' gourmet burger where French fries and a small salad are included in the price. At VW, we had to order French fries for 5 dollars on the side, which were delicious and came with a well-spiced ketchup.

I like the atmosphere of the place, and the location which made seating outside more pleasant than at BBP's right on Walnut Street. The service also was excellent (very much unlike BBP). The staff appears professional, they are attentive and fill up your water very regularly.

All in all, it's a 3.5 - the good burger, atmosphere and service warrant a high rating, but the extraordinarily high price (for what you get) is rather a downer, and I can't give 4 stars to a place where I am unsure whether I'd want to come back. I do like the concept of letting the customer choose their own toppings, which allowed me to choose a combination of toppings you never see but I personally enjoy. On the other hand, the menu of this place is largely uninspired and boring, which in turn is Bobby's Burger Palace's strongest point. If you are in the area, this is probably the highest quality burger + fries you can get - but it comes at a steep price.",2012-06-26 18:57:00,"{'food': ['BBP Burger', 'Craigie on Main Burger'], 'drink': []}"

Our waiter was very courteous and we felt very welcomed the instant we stepped into the restaurant. There was about 8 of us which is probably the ideal number (8-10) comfortably sat around a round table. 
They started with the hand washing and distribution of towels (yeah we were dressed all nicely which is fine, but keep in mind that your pants might get dirty). The cucumber and eggplant portion (it tasted like beef lol) was delicious, the chicken/egg plate was odd but we liked the flaky stuff as we all choked on the powdered sugar on top haha Then came the meats; we had the mild chicken with olives where, its true, the meat just fell right off the bones, and we had half of the beef kebabs and half of the lamb. The lamb was dry, definitely go with the beef kebabs. The couscous was ok, not really great but it probably would have been better to give that before the meat courses because we were getting stuffed. The desserts were fabulous; incredibly fresh fruit,  yummy baklava, and tasty mint tea. The courses were nicely paced and we were finished dinner in a little over 2 hours. All of this for $25 a person! And if you get the wine carafe ($12), get the white wine. 
Now for those of you interested in the belly dancer, our dancer was not that great. She seemed nice but we weren't really into it. However, the other incredibly drunk parties were (luckily we only had to deal with them for a few courses).

Federal Donuts opened up in my neighborhood 5-6 years ago and I never stopped in to try it out. After hear one raving review after another, I said enough is enough and took a walk over...and I was not disappointed (except for one minor factor).

Upon walking in the women behind the counter were so sweet and patient. I told them it was my first time and they were more than happy to work with me while I surveyed the entire menu. Eventually I ended up ordering for my dad and I two chicken sandwiches and two cinnamon sugar ""fresh and hot"" donuts, and a cold brew coffee for myself. This is where the one bad part of my experience comes in: the price. These five items came to $21.60, which I believe is quite expensive.

The cold brew coffee is soooo good. I feel like most places try to nail it down and can never get it right, but Federal Donuts sure did! It had a very robust coffee flavor.

The chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious; the chicken was juicy with a crispy battered outside, the seasoning was nice and balanced, the touch of sauce was just right, and the potato bun was very fresh.

The cinnamon sugar donut...just, wow. These people don't lie when they say it's ""hot and fresh."" It was warm, soft, moist, and loaded with cinnamon sugar. I could easily eat 3-4 of those things in one sitting. At $1.50 a piece you are paying a premium for quality.

Their selection is truly outstanding. You have your choice of patties, cheeses, toppings and condiments to build whatever burger your heart desires. I believe there are some suggestions as well if you're not feeling particularly creative that day. 

The last time we were there, my boyfriend got the Kobe beef burger, thick cut applewood smoked bacon, a fried egg and Vermont cheddar cheese.

If you're tired of all the fancy Stephen Starr joints around town and need to try something new, Marrakesh is the place to see. Located off South Street, its entrance is a dark maroon door complete with an iron knocker. Please be sure to come with friends; as other reviews have stated Marakkesh's six course meal really packs a punch. 

The food was mouthwateringly GOOD. I came here with one other person (rookie mistake) on a quiet Thursday evening, and the waiters were very attentive to us. Everything was delicious without being overly oily. For our first main course we ordered the Spicy Chicken in Cumin Sauce, and for the second Tajine of Lamb. These dishes are meant to be eaten by hand, which we did, but I saw some tables eating with cutlery. Full disclosure, the fruits do come with their labels unpeeled, though I wasn't too worried about that because they were the juiciest, sweetest batch I've had since coming to the States. 

We were about to leave when the manager (owner?) emerged from the backroom and told us to stick around to see the belly dancer. I thought this was a really nice gesture, as the dancer had been hired by a large group upstairs and he really did not have to share this information with us.  

My one critique, if you can call it that, is directed at Marrakesh's decor. True to its Moroccan roots everything from the furniture to the walls is covered with dark, heavy fabric.

First, Cheu is a small location. There are only three tables crammed into a small nook which should onlyt. Second, VERY limited seating. Therefore, this place does not offer reservations, except in extreme cases, and seating it fills up fast. 

However, the food does come out at a fast rate so I cannot see why anyone would want to eat, relax and talk for a bit. The noise level is rather loud and the music does not help in that aspect. 

Besides those little annoyances, Cheu does offer delicious ramen that is worth the wait and crammed area. The secret lies in their small menu that is precise and allows to make ramen a specialty. I tasted ramen from other restaurants and the menus tend to be huge; lots of combinations, food seems rushed and put together; but not here. 

The slices of brisket in my ramen was lean and non-fatty and the broth was absolutely delicious. Cheu does offer apps as well but you can feel up on the ramen alone; but if you must try an appetizer try the Garlic Wings or/and the Pizza Dumplings.

(The cheese and the salsa, however, were tasty.)  Avoid tofu.  Veggies/meats good.

He says: I definitely like MexiCali.  My favorite burritos from them are the ones that have sweet potatoes or plantains.  While not your typical burritos, they actually mix quite well with meats like chicken.  One notable thing about MexiCali burritos is that they tend to be a bit wet.  Due to the salsa and other ingredients you may be likely to have a small puddle resulting from the far end of the burrito as you eat it.  With that said, sometimes I really want a wet burrito, and off to MexiCali I go.

A shame too, because the harissa it was served with was excellent.  The first plate, a chicken liver mousse, was good, but not exceptional.

r-IwgjtjPr7xrlx8aJm7ig,zexRdACYzhpyu_byMWFzHQ,DytKODMqcvQ7MWA0NN2uNw,4,3,0,0,"Last weekend my girlfriend and I , both half insane with cabin fever, decided to walk up to Girard Ave and grab a bite to eat and a couple drinks. As we strolled we listed off our choices trying to make the decision as we walked...East Girard Gastropub, Kraftwork, Frankford Hall, Interstate 295...all good places to which we have already been. But as we passed each one they all looked like sardine cans. Instead of sardines they were packed with humans. Humans that smelled worse than fish in a can. So, we kept on. 

Then we passed Lloyd and decided to give it a try. My girlfriend loves whiskey,  the menu looked interesting, and it was busy, but not filled to the gills. So, in we went. 
My immediate reaction to the decor/ambiance was that it felt like an upscale VFW. The bar is adorned with mismatched stuffed armchairs (cozy!) and fun vintage wall art that has a cabin in the woods and/or dark pool hall feel. There was something just a little off on the overall vibe. I got the sense that the owners had a limited budget to dedicate towards the design and decor. Maybe it was the startlingly white acoustical grid ceiling, or the Pergo floors that make that dreadful hollow knocking sounds when you walk across them, or maybe it was the off-the-shelf white folding residential closet door covering what I assume was a storage closet. This sounds overly nit-picky, but when I think ""whiskey bar"" I imagine a dark, dimly lit, cozy space with dark (real) wood accents and leather. Also, it lacked a good seating area adjacent to the bar. A overly wide space between the tables and bar felt like an unused dance floor. 

But enough about the design of the space. Now to the important part. The food.

I got suckered into some special cocktail that was made with a whiskey that aged for 6 months in some special aged oak barrel. It was yummy, but at $13 a pop - I didn't go for another round. For food bits we got roasted beets in a siracha honey glaze, chicken liver mousse pate with bread, and a mozzarella & prosciutto with broccoli rabe sandwich. I loved the beets and the chicken liver. The sandwich was  good, but basic. There wasn't a crumb left on any of the plates and the servings were pretty generous.  The two cocktails my ladyfriend had were also super yummy, and a much more reasonable $9 a piece.

Overall I enjoyed my experience. The service was very good, the food hit the spot. I would go back again to try their other offerings. I only dwell so long on the ambiance of the place because I think they have a good thing going, but in a town like Philly where there are so many good restaurants with great atmosphere and design, a restaurant has to do more than make good food to survive long term. I hope this place continues to do well. It's great having another quality place to go to in Fishtown.",2014-02-05 23:17:37,"{'food': ['roasted beets in a siracha honey glaze', 'chicken liver mousse pate with bread', 'mozzarella & prosciutto with broccoli rabe sandwich'], 'drink': ['special cocktail made with a whiskey that aged for 6 months in some special aged oak barrel', 'cocktails my ladyfriend had were also super yummy, and a much more reasonable $9 a piece']}"

Pros.

The ramen is great! The wings everyone is talking about are so delicious. I'm hoping to try everything on the menu. 

It's cute no seriously the only way I can describe this noodle bar is cute its like if a bunch of american teens got together and opened a noodle shop cute. I like that I can also watched the chefs make the food if I am at the bar it makes the experience a bit more interactive, I know I'm reaching but it's honestly like watching the cooking channel and them handing the food to you when its done.  

The drinks are daring and cool looking, okay im not much of a drinker in fact I prefer for my drinks to taste like anything but alcohol but still they are great to look at. 

Cons.

It's a little tight. But in today's economy most new restaurants are and I'm here for that. So leave more good reviews and hopefully in enough time they get a bigger spot.

I knew he was on Top Chef, but to be honest, as much as I love restaurants and food, I just can't do cooking competition shows.  They are always on at like 10 pm and they just make me hungry and craving crazy foods late at night.  

However, I heard many good things about Sbraga and they were offering a Chef's Counter menu of ""tailgate"" foods.  So my husband and I ventured up Broad St to check it out.

Let me pause a minute and explain how Sbraga works.  So they offer a 4 course meal for $49 pp.  Each course has about 8-10 options to choose from.  However...

Monday through Thursday, at 6 pm sharp, they offer a Chef's Counter menu, which is a set menu with a specific theme and is served at a bar that overlooks the kitchen.  Think of it as a sort of dinner theater.  FYI- there is a maximum of 6 people allowed for this seating.  This option has six courses, as well as an amuse bouche for $75 pp.  A bit pricier than the regular menu, but you get to watch the chefs prepare your meal for you AND they explain each dish to you.  For you Top Chef fans, Chef Kevin explains some of the courses as well.  Super cool.  I felt like Padma that night (hey, I've SEEN the show, I just don't watch it regularly.  Cause it makes me hungry)

Upon arriving at 6 pm sharp, I noticed how classy and chic the interior is.  At 6:01, I realized how awesome their service is.  I was ready to give Sbraga 4 stars, but their service puts them over the edge.  They make their guests feel right at home.

So how was the food?  Here are the courses and my opinion of each:

Amuse:  Meatballs--- I make some pretty good meatballs, but these blow mine away.  I really liked the sauce- sweet and savory at the same time.

FIRST:  Hoagie Dip--- Hoagie Dip usually makes me a little quesy, but Sbraga's was a delightful fluff of deliciousness.  I could have eaten that all night.

SECOND:  Pepperoni and Beer Cheese Soup--- My favorite thing that we had that night.  A soup made of three things I love?  Yes please!!

THIRD:  Sloppy Jose--- Chef Kevin brings a latin flava to his sloppy joe by using shortrib and chorizo, and covering it in a spicy cole slaw.  Ole!

FOURTH:  Pork Gyro---  I love Greek food and this dish has a homemade tzatziki sauce that was awesome

FIFTH:  Buffalo Chicken--- Surprisingly, my least favorite meal.  The chicken was a little undercooked and the celery-apple-carrot salad missed the mark for me.

SIXTH:  Brownie Sundae--- I thought I couldn't fit anymore food in my stomach.. until this dish came out.  Brownie, covered with ice cream, bananas, strawberries. YUM!

Also, the bartender, who was an absolute doll, brought us over complimentary spiked hot chocolate with a dollop of white chocolate liquor whipped cream.  He mentioned that he made the cocoa in case someone did the beverage pairing, but since no one did, he just gave it to us (sans a bit of the liquor.. which was fine by me on a Tuesday night).  How's that for service?  They could have just thrown it in the trash!

The meze is basically a tapas-style meal - where they serve about 5-6 tapas per order.  By the end of the night, we couldn't even keep track of what we had eaten.  Everything was flavorful, the right mixture of rich for certain dishes and light for more vegetarian options.  We tried octopus, lamb, chicken, bison... just the range was very impressive.

On top of that the hurricanes and pink lemonades margaritas kick-ass (get a double, it's more like a triple...boo-yah!!), the pomegranate margarita is quite delctable as well, in fact its hard to go wrong with their flavored margaritas....on second thought stay away from the mango, it kinda reminds me of cough syrup with a lollipop left in it

They added a downstairs which helps with overflow, but lacks the bright open airiness of upstairs, and kind of feels like being on punishment when all of the cool (and early) people hog up the space by the upstairs bar. But fret not, the food is just as good and the drinks are never weak.

Flat screens that often show soccer, occasional live music, and a fun local crowd (especially on Monday) who refuse to let another neighborhood joint be bastardized by UPenn students (they can all have MarBar!), now it's all coming back to me why I love this place...",2010-01-10 00:11:42,"{'food': ['SPANISH FRIES', 'pomegranate margarita'], 'drink': ['jalapeno peppers, cooked onions, melted cheddar, and old bay', 'mango margarita']}"

The first time was before I got into yelp so I can't really go into too much detail about that experience. I do remember enjoying it and the margaritas. Anyways, I came here recently on a Thursday night with a group of work people. We had a few issues making reservations. When we called we told them we are a party of about 10 and she said that she would have to double check and get back to us, which she never did. We called back and she said that she would have to check with the General Manager because they have quizzo on Thursday nights. We finally got reservations squared away though! And we got seated at two separate tables next to each other. 

My steak tacos were good, nothing special. The margaritas though... I enjoyed all 4 of them! For dessert I shared some dessert nachos those were pretty tasty.

It is unique, somewhere between the Steve's (whole flat slice) and Jim's (chopped to death) presentation.  It works REALLY well, texture-wise.  Liscio's rolls were fresh and shiny, and the Wacky Wednesday deal of a large for six bucks was fortuitous. They usually have SOME kind of deal going though.. Meat was tasty and not gristly, the white American cheese melted like a dream (but short of the sauce that Steve's is.)  I got more meat than my son did, but both were acceptable portions.  Fried onions were 1/4 inch cubes, and caramelized beautifully.   Crinkle cut fries only get so good, but these were pipjng hot, and the Whiz that came on the side worked great on the sammy as well.  Lots of people on Yelp complained about the Whiz, but I could see it along with American as a great combo.Whiz is what Whiz is.

Possibly the REAL best thing here is the 1949 vibe.  This place is a time capsule, where only the prices have changed (and pretty minimally at that) over five decades.  Everything (including real fountain sodas) are made to order. Milkshakes (the half and half was very popular)  were killer.   Waitstaff is attentive and friendly as you are likely to find on the East Coast.  The accents tell you you;re not in Kansas, but the hospitality is sans atty-tude.

The Yelp reviews were pretty positive, so I figured we'd give it a go. Most of the reviewers are correct. This food is FANTASTIC and made with high quality ingredients.

Given that we were going the Sunday before Memorial Day, I called ahead to make sure they had some availability. The hostess told me we'd have a table for 1pm, and we arrived a little early. Another couple also had a table for 2 for 1pm, but due to a clerical error, they could only seat one of us. We gave it to the other couple. This ended up being a pattern for their other patrons who presumably arrived on time and had to wait. This is a pretty bad error considering how much it happened, but given the rest of the experience, I can't deduct a star over something like this. Just be aware that it happens. They were very busy that day, so it took a while for us to get served, but again, not enough of an issue to deduct a star.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the quaint environment and bright colours of the place. It had the same feel as Pop Shop, a grilled cheese place in Collingswood, NJ. It was very cozy, well lit, and country style, what with the counter you can eat at.

We split an order of blue duck fries to start, and they came in a mountainous pile in a large white bowl. Gouda was melted over them with a healthy portion of green onions, as well as some juicy pulled duck meat. Honestly, our meal could have ended there. We were so pleased with them and devoured them in silence- a sure sign of amazing food.

Since both of us came in wanting eggs benedict, we ordered it. Duck benedict with a perfectly poached egg, topped with more green onion and a SRIRACHA HOLLANDAISE. Yes, you read that. Expecting the usual overly hyped sriracha dish, we were proven wrong when the perfectly textured sauce had a nice sweet finish to it, as true to hollandaise. The bread the benedict was placed on tasted like nothing less than homemade bread (could be wrong, but it was fresh and fantastic). The duck on these eggs was probably 3/4in thick- it was extremely juicy and was a very generous, flavourful cut. Nothing in the duck benedict overpowered anything else. All fantastic flavours were appreciated and identifiable.

Let's just get it out of the way, the tacos are pretty legit. I eat at the taco trucks and the down and dirty corner stores and these are pretty good. The restaurant did right by not pricing themselves out of this market. It is a tad pricey, but i think it is worth it--$3.50 per. 3 = $10.50. Mexican places hover around 3 for $8-9, so the price point isn't too far off. 

What separates and warrants the additional pricing is the finished product compared to traditional Mexican spots. Instead of just the meat being center attention, there are Buena Onda has additional garnishes that elevate a typical street food. 

I ordered:
-fried mahi mahi
-carnita
-carne

all were pretty good but the winner by a mile was the mahi mahi. I used the red hot sauce (in the jar, not bottle), so i can't review the green one. The red sauce was really nice, added more flavors to the already flavorful tacos.

Here were the misses...

1. my cousin and i ordered 4 tacos. Cashier rang up 3. 
2. we ordered 2 modelos. Cashier rang up 2 modelos AND 1 CORONA
3. we showed him the ""rewards"" program to get discount. Cashier never gave discount. 

When we paid, i was wondering why it was so high (expecting the discount) and why we got a Corona? Our order was not complex...we did not ask questions. Just put order and paid. I defended the cashier saying ""they just opened, must be oversight"". BUT, my cousin believes he was high while on the job. OH well. 

ALso, i'm not sure how their system is setup because all 3 tacos came out on one tray. What if two people share 3 tacos like i did?

We ordered a large pizza w/ grilled veg. a veggie wrap, + an order of hand-cut fries. The pizza was very good. The veggies were onions, sweet & bell peppers, broccoli and mushrooms. They were briefly sauteed on a flat-top, so I guess that technically was grilled.They were mostly in the center of the pie however. The crust was good, as was the sauce, and ample amounts of cheese made for an above average pizza. Too bad it was cold by the time we got it home, which was only a five minute drive. So were the fries. They were tasty, not overly salted nor greasy. You get a huge amount per order ($5), but were pretty much soggy because of the huge amount piled together.

The menu was created by Marquis and Rich Landau, known for the upscale vegan restaurant, Vedge, and his previous endeavor, Horizon's restaurant. HipCityVeg is a fast food restaurant that serves burgers, wraps, salads, fries, and healthy drinks of many popular non-vegan dishes. I had to try two of these creations!

Let's be honest... These sandwiches didn't last very long! The sandwiches had a lot of flavor and were fantastic! My favorite of the two was the Crispy HipCity Ranch, by a long shot! I liked the Buffalo Bella, but I thought that there would be more of a buffalo flavor. The Crispy HipCity Ranch tasted very much like it's non-vegan counterpart but more fresh and better prepared. I was most impressed by this sandwich! These sandwiches aren't cheap, but are worth the cash if you can spare it!

The restaurant is small. Small enough that I decided to take-out instead of waiting for someone at one of the 5 or so small tables to leave. I decided to just take my order home to eat, but the restaurant is close to Rittenhouse Square, a great park for picnicking or eating from a bench. The atmosphere at HipCityVeg is clean and refreshing. There is water available while you're there that is flavored with fresh fruits. I enjoyed some while I waited for my order to be prepared.

uLIyw2b3NNZbkGrLezf5DA,OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g,F8yozE3NWnImNApHO347gQ,5,20,9,12,"Marrakesh is a total package dining experience. Not only do you get to eat authentic Moroccan cuisine, you get to enjoy a cultural experience as well. 

You may have walked past Marrakesh or the surrounding streets many times without even realizing it was there, like I had prior to this visit. It's nestled on Leithgow Street just a notch off of South Street. Forget South Street or even the rest of Philadelphia for that matter. You are about to step into a different world. To enter you must ring the doorbell on the side door. 

I felt more like I was going to a house, than a restaurant; especially with the shower located in the restroom on the second floor. During my entire visit, I never felt like I was at a restaurant. I felt comfortable and relaxed. Maybe eating with your hands with a towel on your lap has that effect. 

I found my group of fellow Yelpers in a cozy private room.  The room had four tables with booth seating along the outskirts of the room. Ottoman like chairs took up the rest of the space for the rest of us. With such a large group in not the largest of spaces, it got loud.

Our meal started with customary hand-washing and we were even entertained twice with a belly dancer. After placing our order, the food kept flowing. The service was probably the most unobtrusive service I've ever had. As one dish was placed in front of us, another was seamlessly removed. I felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone's dinner party. The regular dining formalities I'm used to were thrown out the window, and it was fantastic! 

As I'm sure you're aware, this $25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to BYOB. While it was a ton of food, I walked in the door absolutely starving and walked out not overly stuffed. I believe most people left absolutely full, so maybe the tip is to come in extremely hungry. Here's a little rundown of dining experience:

Course 1: Three-Salad Platter- The eggplant is phenomenal (and messy). Luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it. The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good, but the eggplant stole the show. 

Course 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon, carbs and meat, this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken, nuts, almonds, egg, peppers and onions. It was really hot at first, but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down, it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course, so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight. 

Course 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce. 

Course 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style, and to be honest, not my favorite. It was a little well done, and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways, right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor. 

Course 5: Couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered, but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point, so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.

Courses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea, fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening, my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes, and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary, but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm, no foul.  

To sum it up, I had delicious food and hours of fun. It's an experience not to be missed in Philadelphia, especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends. While I couldn't imagine going to Marrakesh every Friday night, I can definitely pick a handful of occasions that would be a perfect fit.",2015-07-28 15:31:21,"{'food': ['eggplant', 'chicken', 'beef', 'lamb', 'couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins'], 'drink': []}"

On one of the first chilly days of Fall, I was not in the mood to gnaw on a fibrous salad for lunch. I wanted something warm and indulgent--and just vegan and eco-friendly enough for me to bask in a little first-world smug.  So, I got the crispy chick'n sandwich and sweet potato fries; both of these items really just hit the spot.  If you're looking for a healthier meal there are other items to choose from, and honestly, other places to go in the city. However, if you're looking to fill a Chik-fil-a sandwich sized hole in your soul--this may be for you.

Some notes: Sandwich is very good--bun may be a little much and they may be a tad generous with their ranch dressing, but these things are easily amended.

Fries--great--and this was after having to walk it back to my office a half mile away (yes, in the cold). What makes it better are the sauces: siracha aoli (YUM!) and black bean cilantro (yum).

Overall service was really personable and decor was lovely. Yes, it is a little pricey, but most vegan options tend to be..and yes, it relies heavily on faux meats, but keep in mind that sandwich sized hole in your soul.",2013-10-24 19:22:06,

The setting . Big warehouse style building between 2 somewheres. 4th floor overlooking quasi industrialish part of the river. The crowd. Well it is a bit older. Median age 60 or 60+. The restaurant. They take the space and try to make as many tables as possible by the window overlooking river.

Honestly if this dish were at Ela or Stateside they'd add a lil jazz and the hipsters would be going batshit crazy. This was a very good dish. Red burgundy sauce just matched with snails and mushrooms so well. It was a grab an extra roll to sop it up kind of sauce. And the snails were nice and tender. My wife got the cold local corn soup. Well executed but I'm just not a huge cold corn fan. Very summer sweet.
Mains. Opposing husband got the salmon. Looked ok. Seemed a bit better done than  I prefer but I struggle all the time with this. Sauce looked nice. I got a scallop dish with sauteed veggies, potatoes and a bouillabaise sauce. Very nice. Sauce excellent. Scallops cooked properly. Not a home run but good food. My wife got the home run. Hangar steak cooked medium rare sliced down and in a red burgundy sauce. Side of green lentils. Hangar was perfectly cooked and had that extra meaty flavor that a good hangar steak should have. Burgundy sauce they just do it right. Wonderful dish.

My friends and I checked 2 restaurants but they both had over an hour long waits. The wait at Anjou? Non existant. That should have been a red flag right there but we were starving and they had couscous on the menu, April's fave.

The menu wasn't cheap but the food sounded good. Marco and Karina ordered the ""Chilean Sea Bass w/ Tarot puree, heart of palm salad, atop a miso glaze [26]"". April ordered the ""Pan Seared Red Chile Norwegian Salmon, Sweet peas & couscous in a sun dried tomato, red pepper sauce [22]"" because again, she was seriously craving couscous. A fourth companion, Megan, ordered the ""Bi Bim Bap- A medley of vegetable & egg julienne, served with two traditional Korean sauces and a bowl of miso soup (available without beef) [16]."" I opted for the ""French Cut Chicken Breast, Wasabi gnocchi, wild mushrooms, & asparagus in a sweet garlic ginger sauce [22].""

All sounds delicious doesn't it? Yeah, we thought so too.

First problem. A chip in my glass that was sharp enough to cut a lip. I didn't get cut but I could have! Did I mention the plastic shard at Cheesecake?? The waitress apologized and gave me a fresh glass. Fine, no biggie. 

Second problem. They ran out of gnocchi for my chicken and tried to push the mashed potatoes. Hey, I can make that at home for a dollar. No thanks. So they said they can do risotto. Fine, no biggie.

Third problem. A very, VERY long wait. For a restaurant that wasn't very busy, they sure like to take their time. Maybe they were trying to lure other unsuspecting people from the outside by pretending that they have a full happening place like the rest of them but my friends and I had no interest in being part of their marketing gimmick. We just wanted to be fed! The food had better be worth the wait....

Fourth problem. We finally received our entrees and I immediately recognized a problem. April, the poor innocent patron who had ordered the salmon because of the couscous received, before her, a plate looking very barren with a piece of salmon the size and shape of a sleeve of laffy taffys, 6 or 7 halves of asparagus, and NO COUSCOUS. BIG BIGGIE.

""Where's her couscous?!"" I blurted out. That's when we noticed that nearly all our dishes were missing crucial elements from the menu. 

The chilean sea bass was NOT served with mashed taro and hearts of palm salad. just a ring of MASHED POTATOES. Maybe I should have asked what ""french cut"" meant because now I know that it means ""slice a chicken breast as thin and flat as possible to try to cover the plate and keep down costs."" My wild mushrooms must've gone loco because they were nowhere on my plate. Maybe they were partying it up with my asparagus because they were also m.i.a. My risotto? Oh it was there all right, resting on my plate like a pale, sticky dome of something that resembled MASHED POTATOES! Since when is it okay to be able to scoop risotto with an ice cream scooper?? 

We were not happy campers. We went on a hunger strike. The host went back to the kitchen to find out what happened. He came back and informed us that ""they ran out of the couscous, and the mashed taro"" AND the gnocchi??? And the wild mushrooms??? What do you have back there, a 50 lb bag of instant MASHED POTATOES??? 

The rest is blur. I remember telling the host/waiter/customer service you can't just change an order without asking the patron if it's fine with them. He agreed and took care of the drinks that we had ordered. That much they did right. We still left a tip for the waitress because we felt horrible that she has to tell family and friends that she works there. 

We left. Still hungry and livid. The waitress was outside crying and smoking a cigarette. Poor girl, I hope she moves on to a decent establishment like Hooters or Fudruckkers. I wish her well.

The 5 of us went down the street to Soho Pizza and scarfed scrumptious slices for 2.50 a piece. And when I ordered the mushroom and broccoli pizza, both mushrooms AND broccoli appeared on my slice. See, other people can do it, why can't Anjou?

For another friend she created a drink with Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction's Root liqueur (which is made with the roots and herbs used in old-fashioned root beer), chocolate bitters, seltzer and orange. 

We also partook of food here: First, duck fat fries (which have been a trend in Chicago, where I live, for at least a year, but I'd never had them; I'd never eaten anything involving duck before this, so now I suppose I have lost my duck fat innocence). These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. 

We also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.

Overall, this was a friendly place with fab drinks and great food. I wish it was in my city.",2009-10-17 17:28:16,"{'food': ['duck fat fries', 'soft pretzel sticks'], 'drink': ['Aviation', 'Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction Root liqueur']}"

We were on our way back home from a long afternoon walking tour of Longwood Gardens and decided to try a good old fashioned neighborhood crawl for one of those little Italian neighborhood restaurant gems for which South Philly is so well known. Tre Scalini came up number 1 on Yelp! based on our then current location and, despite that it was in a more commercially developed location than we were looking for (there were 3 othere restaurants in the same small block) I am extrememly glad we decided to go in anyway!

We had no reservation and were dressed rather casually, and despite the fact that it was Saturday night and they were very busy and pretty booked up, the maître d' was able to work us in with absolutely no waiting. Kudos to his efforts!

Since others here have already reviewed the menu offerings, all I'm going to add is (dare I say?) if you're in the mood and it looks good on the menu, it will be. 

The atmosphere is Elegant South Philadelphia Italian, cozy, and warm. Our servers  treated us like royalty, and were extremely attentive despite the fact that we were still in our rather natty sneakers. Each knew the menu and dinner specials inside out, no small task, I can assure you.

Parking is tough in town, and if you just can't bring yourself to pay for the valet parking (it's only 8 bucks, for Pete's sake!), stick it out and don't stop searching until you find a spot - it's well worth the time and effort. And make sure you pay any parking fees - thePPA NEVER takes a break from writing tickets in this city because such a large amount of revenue is generated from the restaurant districts.

I can't recommend Tre Scalini enough -- we couldn't have asked for a better meal or dining experience.

The burger itself was cooked to med-rare perfection the whole patty through, which makes me wonder if they sous-vide it and then give it a quick sear.   The meat itself, while quality, lacked proper seasoning. 

Foie gras has absolutely no business adorning a burger that also contains such overwhelming flavors as bleu cheese and bacon.  Or even a burger at all for that matter.  Its ALMOST as dumb as the concept of a kobe burger.  In any event, it's a gimmick thats worked well for this restaurant, to be sure.  I took mine off and ate it separately. It was delicious and i recommend you do the same if you want to taste the extra $12 or so you are spending.

I dont' know if they still make it, but the Chilean sea bass with pumpkin mole was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. 
My husband and I visited last Sunday for Brunch and we ordered a TON of food because we had a $50 gift certificate to use up. I can highly reccommend the Huevos Divorciados and the Omlette Poblano. I am a poblano and mushroom lover and the oaxaca cheese melts into the eggs and veggies in the most wonderful way. My husband had the Divorciados and it was both unusual and tasty! 
My favorite at Las Cazuelas are the tacos- the steak with fresh onions and cilantro is by far the winner in my book and I confess, I have dreamed of them and often cannot resist the urge to go get a big plate of them! We tried the marinated steak tacos this time and did not like them very much- there was a red coating of marinade on the steak and it was overwhelming. You could not taste the yummy, meat-y, grilled flavor that is so great in the regular steak tacos. My husband loved the shredded pork tacos and I thought they were ok. The shrimp tacos are always a winner and taste fresh, crisp and light. I suppose it is the pure flavors and how they usually treat the fresh ingredients that brings me back time and again, I will veer away from the overly marinated items in the future. As always, the cafe de Olla (coffee with cinnamon +) and desserts are very good. I tell everyone about this place and always bring it up as an option when we have folks in from out of town.
