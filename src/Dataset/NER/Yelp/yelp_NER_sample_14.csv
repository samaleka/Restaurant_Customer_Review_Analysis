That being said, the sushi is surprisingly pretty fresh, albeit lacking in quality or variety.  The sushi boat for 3 had too much repetition of white fish, salmon, and tuna.  2 pieces of toro, 3 pieces of octopus, 1 dragon roll, 1 california roll, 1 rainbow roll.  


Stuffed mushroom appetizer was good.  But with crab, spicy mayo sauce and orange caviar, how can you go wrong?  The mango tuna ceviche-like app was disappointing because the mango wasn't ripe, in the middle of mango season! 

Not a bad deal, because the bill came out to $26 / person including tax and tip, and we were stuffed.  

Typically Chinese (read bad) service.  Hint: train your server not to apologize for her first day of work.  Plus they charged us for plates we didn't order, and had to ask them to take it off the bill.

P.S. They need to invest in a new wasabi company, because it was uncharacteristically flavorless.  Everyone at the table had muddy green dipping sauces.

Second course: the strozapetti (again, might be getting the name wrong) was a nice, light pasta dish, and my companion enjoyed the pork dish.
Entrees: The hanger steak received average feedback, where as my chicken was very good, despite the fact that it was served in a pile of indiscernible ingredients. (That was the one constant of this place, I felt like I was continuously eating things even though I had no idea what they were.)

Although the line can go all the way out the door, and maybe even down the block, the more informal ""eatery"" aspect of this restaurant and quick food preparation keep the tables turning and the wait pretty reasonable. If you go there early, there is free beer while you wait in line. 

The food here definitely has a great price-to-quality ratio. Everything seems freshly made on premises and tastes very flavorful, thanks to Jose Garces's brilliant culinary ideas.

Since I've gone to Wired Beans, I've had their house coffee, cappuccino, hot chocolate, spicy grilled cheese, breakfast sandwiches, and deli creations. I always have a feeling of satisfactory whenever I leave. 

The atmosphere inside is also quite surprising for a store in Germantown. It is quiet with great jazz music playing in the background, and it is toasty warm which is great for the harsh winter weather outside.

this place is small... really small. if yyou show up past 8pm on a weekend you are looking at a 2 -3 hour wait for a party of two or more. however, if you have the time, it is worth the wait. 

my order everytime consists of the following:
village burger, medium, sauce on the side: this burger comes out PERFECTLY cooked every single time. Not once have I told mysef, ""damnit they over cooked it"". The burger doesn't fall apart when you bite into it either like other burgers i've tasted in the area. I do cut it in half to make it easier to handle. You don't need ketchup or cheese for this burger, the sauce they serve is pretty amazing. 

Short rib cheddar fries: 
if you are with 2 or more people, order this. it's sinful. Incredible and way better than just the fries on their own. 

S'more's milkshake. 
This thing is really thick. Sometimes too thick...but it is one of the best milkshakes ever. i tried to go to VW once to get it to go, but they do not offer their shakes to go. It felt a bit weird to drink a shake at the bar, but once i started at it...i was in heaven.

Not only is the quality of the meat superior and always perfectly cooked at Joe's- the sandwich is significantly less greasy than the competition. The best part? How they lightly toast the bread on the grill. And don't get me started on those delicious milkshakes......

Owner, Joe Groh is also the nicest man I have ever met. He truly cares about his product, staff and customers.

The name change was not an easy decision for him and it was done under careful consideration for the longevity of his business, family, staff, and a large portion of the population who are in fact ostracized by the name, 'Chink.' The fact that people still do not understand why operating under this name in 1949 is different than 2014 is flabbergasting. And they are probably Redskins fans.

I have witnessed first hand the verbal abuse, vandalism, and other abhorrent behavior that Joe has had to put up with over the last year and it breaks my heart. I do not know another small business owner who deserves to prosper more than this man.

I look forward to supporting Joe in his decision to change the name by eating a whole bunch of his delicious cheesesteaks - and cannot wait for his second location in Fishtown to open!

I have removed 3  stars from my original review.  Came here again a few weeks ago, with family and friends I had from out of town.  Service was HORRIBLE.  If the food was spectacular I would even over look the fact that the wait staff are incompetent, but their is no overcompensation of anything to over look how poorly taken care of you are in this facility.  

We came here on a Monday during lunch time rush.

pros:
-Got seated immediately.  
-2 floors, decor was fresh and comfortable, booths are HUGE.  
-Food was great and priced accordingly.
-Restrooms [VERY important to me at least] CLEAN


Cons:
-I had my daughter with me and really preferred a booth just so I can keep her in her seat.  After many requests and promises that we would be moved.  We weren't moved for another 45 minutes.  While parties of 2 were being seated in these huge booths.  Families, and larger parties were all seated in little tables, that were way too crowded together.  EVERYONE was complaining.  This is the hostess fault, and I have heard from a lot of people that they also had problems with the hostess  at other Marathon locations.  [ Maybe they just have bad judgement on hiring?]

-after waiting well over an HOUR for our food, the waitress finally came back to tell us that the computers were down and that was the cause to the delay.  Ok help me understand this.  The kitchen stood around for an HOUR during the LUNCH RUSH, with NO orders, and no one checked if something was wrong?  FINALLY our food came out, my brother had the Chicken sandwich.  I had the tuna salad, on a toasted baguette w/ provolone, Bellinda had the chicken toes.  Everything was delish.

Mixed Vegetables Pizza ($17)
Tomatoes, onions, black olives, broccoli, spinach, sweet peppers.

This pizza was loaded with ripe and fresh veggies. Most of the vegetables had a vinegary tang - almost pickled in nature - that was a plus in my book. It was a huge pie overall - quite filling. The negatives? Dough wasn't well seasoned, if at all, and did not hold up well to the onslaught of veggies. In fact, some of the moisture must have seeped through since the dough was sticking to the bottom of the pizza box. Definitely prefer a crust with a more crunchy texture.

The mint tea is good and was included. This is a good spot to relax mingle and smoke hookah. 

I would recommend to anyone who wants to try something different. Since I've been to Morocco I would say this is very authentic!!

My companion and I ordered a bottle of Chianti and shared an antipasto which turned out to be large enough for four, with generous slices of several cheeses, prosciutto, salami, artichokes, pimento and seedless olives.  We couldn't finish it, but it was difficult to stop, and we left very little.

My Eggplant Parmigiano was incredible.  While it's difficult for me to recall all the times I've ordered this dish in hundreds of restaurants throughout the U.S. and Italy, I believe that Maria's offering was the best I've ever encountered.  My companion ordered one of the fish specials, a Bronzino, sautéed to perfection.  Both entrees came with pasta and  small salads of crisp lettuce, perfectly sauced with Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing.

The servers were competent, efficient and extremely personable. When I told our waitress that we enjoy lingering over our appetizer and wine,  she allowed us plenty of time.  She also inquired if we would like some time before our entrees, and accommodated us beautifully.

After the large antipasto I intended to eat only half of my entree, and, in fact, I cut it in half so that I could take home a neat portion.  Unfortunately, my self-discipline failed me, and, I found my self repeatedly taking ""just one more little slice.""  As I consumed the last delectable morsel,  I had to quote the Alka Seltzer Lady's line . . . ""I can't believe I ate the whole thing!""

Neither of us had room for dessert, but when our waitress presented the tray, just in case, and we spied a luscious looking Strawberry Tiramisu, we thought we would just order one to split and take home.  It was superb, and we dispatched it in short order,

This was an exceptionally pleasant experience, and, naturally, Maria's now occupies a place at the top of my favorites list.

Always a fan of breakfasts and baked goods, particularly from a chef who went out of his way to stop by my table to chat when I ordered (er, 'devoured like a viking') the pork shoulder at Zahav, Federal Donuts had been on my 'to visit' list for a while and although my eating plans for the day were substantial I knew walking in the door that I had co-diners throughout the day with whom I'd happily be able to share.

A small space to be sure and not yet busy on a Tuesday morning parking was a cinch and with two bakers plus a young clerk I asked what was best with a typical response, ""everything,"" and sizing up the donuts and realizing them to be small I went with the theme ordering a half-dozen fancy options and one of the made to order hot sugared donuts plus a cup of Federal Blend coffee plus a plastic knife with which to divide the selections.

Making my way to the street and sipping the vibrant coffee with earthy cinnamon tones throughout I started first with the hot ""Vanilla Lavender"" selection and was instantly quite impressed as the exterior was a bit crunchy while the interior was soft and dense, the floral notes understated while mellow vanilla notes came to the fore.  Moving next to the daily selections of $2 fancies it was a mixed bag (or box) with the same high quality textures as the hot donuts but the flavors far more bold - and sometimes a bit strange.

Starting with the selections I expected to work nicely, Creamsicle, Strawberry Rhubarb Pie, and Chocolate Banana each choice was a pleasant blend of flavors with the same cake body simply wrapped in a different glaze - a fan of cake donuts over yeasted 'raised/glazed' things were off to a good start.  Moving next to the more aggressive flavors, Chili Mango and Pomegranate Nutella both proved to be quite bold and interesting - the former with a bit of heat and the later somewhat akin to a peanut butter and strawberry jelly sandwich in flavor.  Far less successful, the Mandarin Coffee was simply not my style - far too much acid with the smoky coffee notes providing little balance.  Overall a really interesting spot with a good vibe and prices far less than many 'designer' donut shops I unfortunately never did make it back for the fried chicken.....though I guess there is always next time.",2013-01-08 12:52:56,"{'food': ['pork shoulder', 'hot sugared donuts', 'fancy options'], 'drink': ['Federal Blend coffee']}"

Last night my friend and I were lured there by the newest recession deal, it's $2 cans of Modelo beer and 1/2 priced house margaritas which are great ($4.50).. but would you expect less of a place that brags about it's extensive tequila collection?  Oh yeah, you can also get 1/2 priced food from the late night menu in the lounge after 10pm.  So It's another late night happy hour.  I've tried Steven Starr's same type of deal at Jones but that's like slumming it compared to Steven Cooks menu at Xochitl.

My friend and I arrived hungry and thirsty, which meant we were gonna spend money regardless of the price.  We drank a few house margaritas each after a round of beers.  The main bartender in the lounge was working like crazy because this place was packed.  There were also people drinking while waiting for a place to sit.  We sat at the bar which probably was a good bet.  Drinks taste better when you see just how generous a pour they give you with the booze. [sigh]
Agreeing to split all the food we ordered, we started with an order of the Lamb tacos which were very delicious and a decent portion compared to the Sopes (Duck, goat cheese and chorizo on fresh masa tortillas with black beans) which tasted great but mini tapas sized and the same price.  I probably wouldnt order the Sopes again.  We ordered the  frise' salad that had duck and cinnamon smoked figs and blue cheese.  Yeah, the ingredients read as culinary porn for sure but the portion wasn't porn sized, if you know what I mean. (do I need a cheesy wink here?)
We were still hungry since we were two guys with empty stomachs.  Since we enjoyed the tacos so much, we tried the even better pork ribs tacos and the skirt steak sandwich.

Now...   

The drink and wine prices are too high and too limited.  Honestly if it was a byob, I would have been happier.  Unfortunately the wine we wanted was more than both our dinners put together so i got $12 bottles of beer.  Good beer but too much.

The waiter didn't offer coffee and put the check down while we were still eating.  Apparently they wanted to please more guests and we were in the way.

our server was a good dude who explained everything very well, perhaps too well. I say dude because he was extremely casual with us - totally fine as I'm a casual dude myself but could rub some folks the wrong way. 

big green salad - interesting, but not amazing. good attention paid to individual ingredients (roasted tomatoes, pickled celery/fruit, interesting dressing). nice!

I was visiting Philly that day (Oct 27th)..tourist stuff..liberty bell, independence hall, etc. with my boyfriend, his nephew, his father, nephew's wife and wife's father. We came separately on the tours but got together in time for lunch. We yelped close by places and this place came up..I think I latched on to the menu item Fried Green Tomatoes app as well as Bacon Grease popcorn  and that they had BBQ...so we trekked down about a 1/2 mile and came upon this funky little place and got a table quickly. We had to try the bacon grease popcorn to start and ordered a bag for the table. We should have ordered more! Gosh darn yummo!! Just enough bacon flavor with the cajun seasonings..perfection! I ordered the tomatoes and my boyfriend and I split a 3 meat plate that was chicken and 2 orders of ribs. Our sides were the mac and cheese, collard greens and coleslaw. Our family ordered various things like the brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, etc. No complaints all the way around. The three sauces they put on the table were all delicious. I loved the south carolina vinegar base and the St Louis style tomato based. Both were delicious slathered on the chicken and ribs. The fried green tomatoes were perfectly tangy with a light crunchy cornmeal crust. The dipping sauce was nice too. I think it was chipotle based. yum! 

As for the sides. The mac and cheese was cheesy, creamy yumminess. Usually mac and cheese is boring at BBQ places..standard velveeta like dried up crap. This was fresh and the stringy cheese melted perfectly..tasted like it was made with cream too..just wish we had more than a tiny bowl to share! The greens were still slightly firm which I like. I prefer greens made with ham hocks but these were vegan version..so lacked that extra flavor from the hocks but were still good. The coleslaw was crunchy but perhaps our only slight disappointment as it tasted a little too salty. I preferred it over an overly sweet slaw, but maybe needed some salt adjustment or SOME sweetness to counterbalance..but I would not avoid the place based on that one minor dislike. 

 I enjoyed two blackberry mint juleps..the regular version as the frozen machine was not working..but they were fresh and lovely! 

We overate here with reckless abandon and would do so again..if only they would open a 2nd shop in San Francisco. I told the lovely waitress to work on that with the owner! :-)

As such, I have set out on a great goal: Eat everything on the menu. You think this would be easy but with wonderful daily specials, this a difficult feat. 

Now dinner-wise, I do prefer the MEZE. Only because I like the surprise of it all. But here are some dinner items I have tried.

1) Dips of the day: For a petite girl like myself, even when I split this with my bf, I still feel full. Usually, there is always the typical garlic hummus (which is really atypical here) and fresh twists on hummus like pumpkin. Everything is seasoned beautifully and the grilled pita that comes with it is the perfect addition.

3) Greek Salad: The fresh produce carries this dish as well as the homemade dressing. Tastes like a combo of white wine vinegar, salt, lemon, and cracked pepper. But of course, I know there is something that I am missing. It may not even have these ingredients but no one is going to tell me exactly what it is. 

4) Poultry of the day: I think that it is cooked underneath a brick. Rottiseur chicken to the tenth power. Sometimes it may come with cauliflower and a creamy sauce underneath. 

5) Lemonada: Now this is truly a lemon cordial meaning it is concentrated. Depending on my mood, I add a little water to this because the flavor is so intense. I wouldn't say that it is the sugar but the lemons which makes it intense. Sometimes I just drink the thing like it's water. Again, I have my moods.

6) Lemonana: I love the mix of the mint tea and lemon cordial. If you don't like mint tea, don't get this because the lemon cordial does not mask the mint by any means.  However the flavors truly complement one another.

7) Cyprus Breakfast: Scared to try something new? Go with the Cyprus Breakfast. Great introduction into the brunch atmosphere here. Lounza essentially tastes like ham but it's not ham. Does that make sense :)

8) Kanella Platter (Brunch): When I feel like grazing, this is what I get. The shining star to me are the grape leaves. Firm but not mushy. I hate when I get grape leaves and inside the rice is mushy. Not here. I can cut the grape leaf without it falling apart.

9) The Cypriot: Classic Cypriot style ham and cheese served warm with a cucumber and tomato salad served chill. I'm a petite girl so I usually eat half of this and take the rest home for a midnight snack before going out.

10) Organic pork and Sieftali kebab: This is  a lot of food for me. Especially if I know that I will delve into some of the desserts later. I won't review what I thought was outstanding in this dish because my bf was talking my ear off and I wasn't really concentrating on the food. Just stuffing my face.

11) Zorba The Burger: Every time I have this, I feel like Kanella should just have a to go window or a little cart outside where they sell this, some greek chips, and lemonadas to go. When I see the Zorba come out in all of its glory, I only wish that my stomach was a bottomless pit so that I may partake in its deliciousness. Now this does not come with greek chips. Whenever I see someone order this, I see that they are somewhat surprised by this. A burger, that's it? But that's all you need when it is cooked to perfection, seasoned like no body's business and topped with a fresh yogurt and mint sauce. Think this comes with a pickle which the bf always eats.

12) Lachanopita: Not feeling meaty but don't want to feel like you are missing out on meat?. This is it. A savory pie made with love.

13) Baklava: Now when I get this, I swear I could eat 10 more but realize that two squares is all you need to feel satisfied. Date ice-cream is the perfect mate and not overwhelming.

14) Chef's mother's coconut, date, and hazelnut cake: I would describe this as a date brownie. I don't like dates but I will eat this no problem.

15)  Pagoto: Chocolate, lavendar, lemon, oh my. You never know what it will be but it is oh so good. Don't split this, make your guest order their own. 


Atmosphere: I like that there is no music here. Or is there? Kanella takes away from all my other senses and all I can do is taste. I do not dine in a group here because I need to go in on all of the food without judgement. Kostantinos is always friendly and to me, the prices are beyond fair. Every time the BF and I dine somewhere else, we feel like we are cheating on Kanella or got cheated because we end up paying more for less quality. The specials are truly special; meaning you MAY never hear them offered ever again :o. But don't fret, if the special sounds good, it is.

The chicken satay tacos are SOOO good. Get two and a thai tea and you will be full! The chicken is very flavorful and the tacos are pretty big, topped with lettuce, red cabbage, tomatoes, some sort of sauce and avocado slices. Very fresh, crunchy flavors that balance out the curry chicken satay. 2 for $6. Maybe a little steep for food from a truck but trust me, the tacos are even better than some that I've had at a sit-down restaurant! for real. 
Next, chicken katsu over rice. Again, very flavorful and unexpected from a lunch truck. Around 5 bucks and so worth it! But as a heads up, they are always out after the lunch rush... 

I have yet to try the captain crunch talapia because I've been sticking to my tacos but next time I stop by, I'll give it a try.

They give you plenty of food, so you know you will walk away with a full stomach. If you arrive before 7:30, the place will be on the quiet side bordering on dead silent, but it's a good time to have conversations where you can actually hear the other person. After 7:30, especially on a Friday, this place lights up. Keep in mind, this also means slower service, so you should either order drinks or BYOB.

It's difficult to say anything negative about this establishment because they are quite hospitable and accommodating. It would be a bum deal to come here if you were vegetarian, but if you don't eat red meat (lamb, in the case of my boyfriend), they can make you a veggie plate on the lamb course. Now, I don't have too much experience with Moroccan food (unless you count Hookah), but, for me, the dishes that combine both savory and sweet flavors still take some getting used to. For this reason, I was not a fan of the ""phyllo dough dish with egg and chicken"" nor the lamb. My faves are the eggplant from the salad course, chile chicken, and the couscous (more soupy than what I've seen, but I like it). I will definitely come back when I have friends visiting from out-of-town (they should also be adventurous because I know people who don't particularly like eating with their hands), but dinner here on a random weekday seems a little excessive.",2011-11-05 06:47:50,"{'food': ['eggplant from the salad course', 'chile chicken', 'couscous'], 'drink': []}"

We got the Texas Hold 'Em and the Saigon Dog both of which were quite good but I'd say the Texas wins out.  It was pretty filling for a hot dog but I probably could have gone for another but just didn't think it was worth it.  That leads me to the biggest draw back of the place, price.  These hot dogs aren't good deals.  They're over priced.  That means I won't go regularly but I will go when I have the right level of hunger and want a very unique hot dog.  So I guess that's their selling point--it's a buck or two over what I'd call a good deal but it's only a buck or two extra so when you want an interesting hot dog it's worth the extra money.

The homemade corn and lime soda had a nice bite to it.  It was definitely unique and enjoyable to drink although it clashed a little with some of the tastes in the hot dog.  Bonus that they let us try it in advance.

The food is flavorful and delicious. Some dishes that you don't see on the menu at every Thai place. Service is hit or miss, but I've never had any problems. Fresh vegetable spring rolls are incredible. Laab is yummy. Steamed red bean dessert is like nothing you've ever had before. There's some ginger basil something rather that is probably my favorite thing there. We eat there a lot and I'm trying to work my way through the menu.

I've knocked them down a star because the spiciness level varies. That being said, I've requested my food Thai hot and, after an ""are you sure?"" from the server, was served an incredibly delicious super spicy meal. I have found that, unless you specify that you want it very hot, though, that the food will come out mild. That's certainly fine for a lot of people and they've probably done so to Americanize some of the authentic spicy dishes but just know to ask for it hot.

I immediately made a reservation for four for Friday night. Eatalia did indeed hold up to the reputation laid out by fellow Yelpers. The service was impeccable. Our server and the owner catered to our every whim, water glasses were constantly refilled, food was brought out quickly, we were checked on but not rushed in the slightest, and not bothered while we downed two huge bottles of wine while chatting and laughing (O.K. we drank that wine pretty damn fast). As for the food we ordered the anti pasta for four, I was a little underwhelmed with this as I felt a lot of the flavors on the dish tasted too similar, nothing jumped out at me but others at the table throughly enjoyed it. My reccomendation though would be pass at a price of $40.00 for the table. For my main course I ordered a seafood risotto, there was a good amount of seafood, the risotto was cooked just right, a very tasty dish. My sister ordered the veal Saltimboca, the super tasty vegetables (we want more, we want more), salty procciutto combined with perfectly cooked veal, spinach and provolone definitely made it the meal of the night. Her fiance got a fish dish that was on special, he seemed pleased with it though I didn't taste it. My boyfriend ordered the carbonara, he must have loved it as it was gone in less than five minutes. When it came time to order dessert I asked the owner if the tiramisu had chocolate on it to which he told me no (I HATE HATE HATE chocolate but LOVE LOVE LOVE tiramisu) my sister ordered a spice cake and her fiance ordered some kind of chocolate dessert, about five minutes later the owner came back and said he was mistaken and the tiramisu did indeed have chocolate on it. He offered me some icecream or something else which I declined. I was slightly dissapointed but really appreciated him letting me know before bringing out a dessert I would never eat.

However, since I stopped eating red meat in October, those cravings have gotten much harder to satisfy. I read Mikey I.'s ROTD for Hot Diggity and damn, he made it sound so good! I debated whether or not I should venture down for lunch and posted a Facebook status. ""Vegetarian hot dogs: worth trying?"" I got mixed responses, but ultimately decided to go for it, but not before questioning the super nice guy behind the counter at Hot Diggity. He said he eats them sometimes, just for funzies and not because he doesn't eat meat. Ok, I'm sold. 

The dog itself was piping hot, crispier on the outside and relatively normal looking on the inside. I still got my hot dog flavor, but with barely any of the fat/cholesterol! Seriously, those pups are like 80 calories a pop. 

I got the ""Bronx Bomber"", which came topped with spicy mustard/sauerkraut etc., which definitely helped disguise the the origins of the dog. The roll was substantial and tasty.

7:30 rolls around. 8pm rolls around. We finally call--and the phone rings, rings, and finally goes to an answering machine, which helpfully confirms their hours (and that they should be open). We call about six or seven times in the next half our, in the blind hope they're just really busy.

Withing a minute of sitting down she already had the same bottle of sake i had last time ready for me. 

The atmosphere from the outside reminds me of a fast food Chinese restaurant but when you walk in it is completely different. Dim lighting and very nice oriental decor really make the place feel comfortable. Within the place they have a sushi bar and a hibachi grill if your in the mood for some fun. 

On to the sushi. It is fantastic. Really well seasoned rice and very fresh fish bring a smile to my face with each bite. You know its good sushi when you don't even have to use the soy sauce to season your roll. 

I have no yet tasted anything on their regular menu but from talking to a couple regulars as i was eating my sushi i was told that it is the best Japanese cuisine in the northeast. Good food in northeast Philadelphia is hard to come by so i am hoping i stumbled upon a jem. So all i can really recommend is the sushi but it is something i highly recommend.",2011-11-07 01:10:36,"{'food': ['sushi'], 'drink': []}"

I sat on a couch waiting for a table to open next to an outlet and the only one open was a four top.

You've probably read that Black Sheep has three floors. The paint party was supposed to be in the basement, so we ended up down there on the couches surrounding a small coffee-table like of table. It was cozy down there, almost like someone's well decorated bar themed basement. We were the only patrons downstairs so it really did seem like were in someone's cozy basement. 

There were various specials for happy hour, but the Tröegs Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA caught my eye. It's normally $6, which isn't bad at all. However it ended up being $1 off for happy hour. Sweet! 

We ordered several appetizers for the table including the mac n cheese, Brussel sprouts and the veggie quesadilla. Based on what everyone said about the mac n cheese, I knew I had to try it even though I didn't want the full appetizer order. And you need to try it too. It is as good as everyone says. It's really creamy and the bread crumbs are a nice touch.

The veggie quesadilla was also good but nothing to really rave about. It was your standard quesadilla except it was full versus flat. It was almost more like a Panini it was so doughy. I think the side of salsa was probably the best part of it. The tomatoes were well-seasoned and plentiful, almost like a side salad. 

The Brussel sprouts were my least favorite. I've had such amazing Brussel sprout dishes but these just fell flat.  They weren't flavored well and almost seemed a little dry. Thank goodness for the bacon- the saving grace of the dish. So much for a healthy vegetable option. Adding a little of the salsa from the quesadilla helped a bit. Overall, I just wasn't impressed. 

So the bill ended up being dirt cheap since some of the appetizers were also happy hour specials. For all three including tax and tip, it came to about $22. We just ate appetizers and beer but I was definitely full.

I ordered the some kind of crazy tree roll which was salmon, white fish, and tuna wrapped in cucumber.  In my opinion, this would have been easier to eat if the roll was more vertical vs horizontal.

The menu is tiny and there is only one burger, and it's not a regular lettuce/tomato/ cheese burger. The burger I got today, off the special Fourth of July menu -- so I realize it's a little different than the normal menu, but why further limit your burger selection on the Fourth? The regular menu didn't include *any* burgers -- was a single, 3 oz patty. I asked if it could be cooked medium and was told that it would arrive medium to medium well, as it was too small to cook to  preference. Medium well?? But it's $15 and I would really prefer medium. I didn't say that bc the server seemed mad that I would ask for a specific temperature. So I asked if I could have fries instead of the sides that were included (potato salad, corn cob, and chips) and was told 'no', but I could order a side of fries in addition to the sides that I didn't want. So, not easy to order burger and fries on the Fourth. 

The burger that arrived, tiny as indicated, was covered in pickles and onions so that you could barely taste the meat and was really salty. My husband got the pork sandwich and it was a mess, covered in the sauce that comes with it. It fell apart immediately and was not well seasoned. The fries he got weren't seasoned either. 

I've eaten here before and those experiences were better, but I haven't had a good experience yet. I thought that P&K was supposed to be so amazing, with really good burgers ( I really love burgers!!! ) but how can that be true when only one is on the menu???

We put our names in for seats and then strolled along Callowhill to check out the Granary and the new pet store, Unleashed.

We were texted exactly 25 minutes after we put our names in (the exact estimated wait time) and got two seats at the marble pizza counter - watching pizza making is entertaining so our seats were prime time.  Our order consisted of the arugula salad, rotolo, and the sausage pizza.  Much of the friendly staff at Alla Spina were filling in shifts at Pizzeria Vetri, and it was nice to see familiar faces.

Rotolo is a necessary venture.  For only $3 you get a massive garlic knot stuffed with ricotta and prosciutto, heavily dusted with pistachio.  I would like to get one massive pizza sized rotolo and feast on that.  Our salad was also extremely good - Vetri doesn't skimp on cheese and I'm thankful - lightly tossed in dressing with warm fingerling potatoes and tiny kalamata type olives pits in.  

Finally our pizza arrived within the two minute cook time in their Renato 900 degree oven.  Sliced and herbed right in front of us, it smelled what heaven for Italians must smell like.  We also got two of the new Yard's brew from the board which rounded out our experience.  Even though it's a bit pricey for a Yard's, the beer selection is on point.  

I so wish they had outside seating so we could bring our pooch, especially considering the pet store nearby.  It might be an issue on that block as none of the restaurants have seating outdoors.

The wine was good--seriously, good.

The food was bad--seriously, not so good.

So, if I get a panini I expect it warm throughout, not hot on the outside and cold in the middle.  Apparently, this is a common complaint, as the server said it happens all the time.  Still, even cold, the whole Italian meat + broccoli rabe thing wasn't doing it for me, as it was all rabe and no meat.  The salad was so overdressed it DRIPPED.  It didn't help that the kitchen staff was yapping away in Spanish, which I understand, about how they were unhappy.  Dudes, you get paid well and should not be complaining about life (particularly in loud tones) in front of customers.  In a commonly understood foreign language.

Cons.

I've been here quite often and made this place one of my fave places to go. However since they changed the manager a while ago, I dont think its a good place to eat at no more. I had dinner with my family and my sis left an empty container on the table. It was EMPTY, it had no smell or disgusting leftovers inside. When we were about to get into the car (coincidentally we parked our car right in front of the rest.) sudennly the manager (even tough I dont think its appropriate to put a manager title to such an ignorant man like him) came out holding the container and asked us whether its our belongings (with a high tone and rude impression on his face). I said no thats just trash, and he said it out loud (again with the rudest face I've ever seen in my whole life) that I cannot leave my trash there. To cut the story short, I came back in to the rest and asked about it, and he argued with high tone. Right after I said to him that he needs to watch his attitude, he right away pointed his middle finger to me! Okay, my patience's gone. I didnt think I deserved any crap like this. Whats the big deal of leaving a container on the table??? Its just irrational and super crazy for a ""manager"" to make such a hassle about it! A true manager would've just shut up. He even still arguing and kept pointing his finger at me while we were walking out from the rest. He kept on yelling to leave the place and never come back no more.  Not enough for that, as we're getting into our car, he AGAIN pointed his middle finger and shook his ass!!! He then made a gesture like he was about to f**k me! At that time my bro was so mad and approached him, telling him to go back into the rest if he didnt want to get hurt. WTF! Hellll what kind of manager is that! Such an ignorant, uneducated, and snobbish person like him doesnt deserve to work in any fields especially being a manager!!!

They wouldn't let us sit at a 6 person bench outside until our whole party was there even though there were about 6 benches open, but they would sit us inside immediately and just let our friends join us. This turned us off and we walked back outside to decided what to do, and then the other friends came which caused us to stay since one of them was craving a margarita. The house margarita was pretty good actually, not too sweet, could have been stronger. I had the brisket tacos and was pretty satisfied with them. The brisket was tender and you can't go wrong with anything that includes guacamole in my opinion. A few of my friends had the chorizo and their tacos were falling apart because they were too moist. Overall the meal was authentic and decent, but I would hope the experience would be better if I decide to go back.",2016-05-12 12:27:51,"{'food': ['brisket tacos', 'chorizo'], 'drink': ['margarita']}"

My wife and I went here for the first time for lunch yesterday. This place IS the real deal. Amazing food. Completely authentic. Reasonably priced. We've officially added Khmer Kitchen to our list of favorite spots. 

Between the two of us, we ordered 3 dishes, which was more than enough (we ended up boxing the 3rd dish because we were already full). We started off with the Prah-hok Kateeh (second to last item under ""Traditional Khmer Dish"" on the menu) and absolutely loved it. This dish was recommended in other Yelp posts and also by the waiter / owner, who described it as a pork dip for fresh vegetables. So good! After that, we had the Cha Kr'ung with frog, spicy (second to last under ""Saute Dish""). This dish was nothing short of incredible. The final dish, which we had to box up, was a soup with pumpkin in it (can't remember the name) which was also good but had a bit of a strong smell to it that caught me off guard at first (fish sauce?). Regardless, we ended up having it for dinner and were completely satisfied.

It tasted like breakfast, but uniquely different and glorious (it must've been secret Greek cheese and spices). Mine was great too don't get me wrong!

MZyyUkOglR07EbAmtiXmRg,f3sNvuXS-Qin_YMNbmoKng,Q-prSTdggNlxAEFV88BZOw,4,4,0,4,"I went to Tria this past weekend to meet up with some friends, a little early start to the night's Memorial Day weekend festivities.  First, I mistakenly went to the 18th st. location, only to realize my friends were at the one on 12th & spruce...no matter, a quick cab ride got me there in no time.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:
This place is clearly for the sophisticated crowd, as if there is a such thing as the unsophisticated wine and cheese bar (I won't ask).  It's a place to go to enjoy a fine glass of wine and a small thing or two off the menu.  It didn't strike me as a place to go for dinner, although this might not be the case...I had a couple glasses of the Four Graces Pinot Blanc, and the Italian Meats tray.

THE LAYOUT:
Sophisticated and refined are the key words here.  It's not some lifestyles of the rich and famous kind of pomp-shack...but if you are put off by yuppies in sport coats laughing pretentiously at the toiling of the average lowly peon, this might not be the joint for you (okay, I didn't hear any laughing about said subject going on, but you get the point hopefully).  Dark wooden furniture, lit naturally by the afternoon sun peering through the large open windows.  There is a patio section and an indoor section, separated by these large windows, which are open in warmer months.

THE WINE & FOOD:
The reason I tried the Four Graces is because Tria does a special, pairing a selection of wine, cheeses, and beer, first round is half off.  It was exquisite in my (unseasoned) opinion-- I was looking for a wine that wasn't too dry, a little fruity, and that held it's flavor and consistency throughout.  Hit the nail on the head.  The Italian Meat platter was also very good-- various Italian meats that I won't dare to try and remember the name/spelling, some of the sweetest red peppers I've ever seen, and a delicious mixture of garlic-infused olive oil with a tangy red pepper/garlic paste for the bread...oh yeah, and Caper Berries...I don't like them, so I won't allow it to affect my review, if you like em, you will probably enjoy them here.  It was all very tasty, if not a little expensive (although not necessarily overpriced)...I wasn't expecting more for my money, per se, I was just surprised at the bill.  It's not a killer, but it was a little high.

THE SERVICE:
We were fortunate enough to have Shuli (sp?) as our server, she was very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.  Sometimes when you visit a place like this, you get some hipster wine snob who expects you to know Napa like the back of your hand.  Well in Shuli's case, despite my constant ignorant inadvertent insults to the finer things in life, she was able to boost my experience by being so nice.  I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that there isn't a set dress code for the staff there, but someone behind the bar was wearing a plaid shirt...not what I'd expect to see, but I don't get bothered by things like that.

THE ATMOSPHERE:
We spent the afternoon in a wine-induced haze (not drunk, mind you) feeling the buzz and the warm breeze.  We talked about all kinds of things, including the VERY eclectic soundtrack, which went from kama sutra-esque ambient, to underground chill hip hop, to country, to pub rock.  I don't know who the hell put together that playlist, but it drew more laughter than anything else-- the transitions were too abrupt.  It didn't take away from the experience, but it was notable.

THE VERDICT:
If you are looking for a great, relaxing, refined experience, or if you want to throw (or enjoy) a wine and cheese party outside of your designer loft, Tria, is the place to go.  I gave it 4 out of 5 for the minor annoyances I had (I'm like Larry David when it comes to wierd random quirks like that), but it really was an excellent way to start the evening, and I would love to go back again!",2008-05-27 14:22:17,"{'food': ['Italian Meats', 'Caper Berries'], 'drink': ['Four Graces Pinot Blanc']}"

We went inside and there was a weird incongruity of basketball on flatscreens in the relatively upscale bar. The spaces were fine, but seemed thrown together and not really thought out as a whole in decor and design.

The first tip offs to the food quality were the drinks; we each had one at the bar before continuing for dinner. My fiance's La Chilindrina was fine, but nothing special, while my Senor Barriga was pretty bad. With dinner, my fiance had an El Fumador, which was nigh undrinkable. We ordered it in part because the bartender described it as smokey, not spicy, and, yeah, it had habaneros in it, but who am I to second guess the bartender? Turns out, we should have (though the service was good while we were at the bar; this theme of good service and nothing else good continues throughout the place).

Dinner was just not good. We ordered the El Sabor tasting menu, so we got guacamole for the table along with an appetizer and entree each.  The guacamole was prepared tableside but overly salty and bland. We relied on the waitress's recommendations for appetizers figuring she wasn't incentivized to increase the check since we asked for the tasting menu. Well, her ""personal favorite appetizer"" huarache was bland bread with bean paste and raw egg, and the sweetbreads were a couple of breaded hunks with some pickled vegetables. There was no unification of taste, when there was much taste at all. Entrees were more of the same. My fiance's tamales were bland and bean-pastey--I've had better frozen from Trader Joe's. The best part was my brisket, which was tasty but salty, though the rest of the dish was really thrown together and, again, bland. I've had good celery root puree, but this was not it. It also took an extraordinarily long time for our entrees to arrive, even after the waitress assured us it ""would be right out"". We ended with the churros, which was good but not special, and we only ordered it because we didn't want our entrees to be the last taste in our mouths before we went home.

Our waitress was quite nice, but this couldn't save the other lapses by the kitchen. The food and drinks were mediocre at best, almost inedible at worst.

They do a really nice roasted cauliflower, with a very good dressing. Brussels Caesar is excellent, and you can order it without the pancetta. One complaint from my crowd was that the polenta was watery. That might simply have been the one-off for the meal.

Some very good beers on tap - I had the Troegs IPA, can't go wrong with that, served in a very attractive tall glass.

One down side is that this place has the potential to be unreasonably loud. The evening I was here, we sat toward the front (entrance) of the restaurant, and it was fine, noise-wise. Quieter there, I think, so you might want to request a table toward the door if you want to have a conversation during hours when the restaurant is packed and very loud. Avoid sitting directly under or close to the speakers.

Outdoor seating is a plus, but it's first come, first served.

I went to try this place out as my friend who is a local told me that it is a hidden gem. Cucina food truck was lined up with all other food truck, but this one stood out from the rest due to the long lines formed by its customers.

I ordered the Tilapia Over Rice and it was one of the best food truck food I have had. The fish was not over fried and was still soft on the inside. The portion is very generous so this can be an option for students on a budget. When you order any of their food, you can ask for it to be ""Bossed Out"" meaning to put all the sauces in it. Make sure you are comfortable with all of their sauces first.

I would definitely go back due to being so close to my work.

I ordered the vodka penne with shrimp, I also tried the orrecchette with crab meat.  Both were pretty bland.  I kept looking around for seasoning shakers that are at neighborhood pizza places to spice my food up a bit.  Nothing was terrible, it was edible, but not something that I would spend money on again.  

I am curious about the pizzas though.  One of the other members of our party ordered one and I was very jealous. It looked good, and they had some interesting options for toppings. This would be my reason for giving BARRA another shot.  

Our service was friendly, water was filled quickly, everyone had a drink in front of them when they wanted one.  Plus, their signature cocktails aren't bad at all, I forget the names of the ones that I tried, but they were good.

I wish that I could have ordered a hookah and puffed away while I was eating dinner, but I was informed that they are for the hookah bar next door only.  I did appreciate the smell of the shisha as they brought the hookahs next door through the dinning room from BARRA's kitchen.

We saw a couple of diners rushing over to the bathrooms to inform their friends that the door had not frosted over and people could still see them.

The filling to the tacos was pretty good actually, but they were served on the hard taco shells that I swear were the Old El Paso brand you can buy at the grocery store. I asked for a side of salsa--also not fresh or homemade. I asked my husband what the glaze on the meatloaf was and he described it as ""brown gravy and ketchup, mixed together"". Yuck!

I know, you're thinking, why do you keep going back?  But it's because it is right in Center City and near work/school/home etc.  However, I am not going to be eating here again any time soon.  Maybe coffee.  MAYBE.

And here's why:

1.  I went into Cosi to order a salad.  I was the only person in there because it was an odd hour.  I told him I wanted a salad without lettuce (don't hate) and that I would pay extra if giving me more of the toppings was a problem.  He looked at me with disgust and told me this could not be done.  I told him I was pretty sure it could since he had everything I needed right there.  He put in the regular amount of toppings (tiny scoop) and then shoved the bowl at me and said ""THIS is what you want?!"" I told him I would be happy to discuss it with the manager if it was a problem and asked if he could put in another scoop of each thing.  He did what I asked while mumbling under his breath that this was ridiculous and he didn't know how they would ever figure out an appropriate price for this.  When I went to pay, the cashier had no problem figuring it out and I left but it was a not so good experience to be told by an employee that what I want is outrageous when it is far from.

2.  I went to use their WiFi and order breakfast.  The WiFi wasn't working.  Something about being so close to Starbucks' WiFi and that it's ""sometimes an issue"".  They did reset it for me but it still didn't work and I was not able to do anything.  What's the point of having non working WiFi.

3.  I ordered an egg and Cheese squagel for breakfast.  I was one of two people waiting for food and the other person picked their up and left right as I was placing my order.  It shouldn't take very long to make but somehow, 10 minutes later, I was still waiting.  When I got my sandwich, I rushed out because I was going to be late and when I opened my sandwich about 10 minutes after that, I discovered it was a BACON, egg, cheese and TOMATO squagel.  I do not eat bacon.  I do not eat tomatoes.  Even though I picked it all off (otherwise no breakfast and I had a meeting that wouldn't be providing nourishment), the bacon and tomato took half of the sandwich with it and I was left less than satisfied.  

Again, I might go back for the coffee because it's pretty hard to screw that up and when you need coffee, you need coffee, but these last three incidents (I have MANY more but they aren't recent enough to yelp about) have left me completely uninterested in eating at Cosi ever again.",2012-01-07 21:42:45,"{'food': ['salad', 'egg and cheese squagel'], 'drink': ['coffee']}"

Menu is overpriced for the mediocre quality. It offers a non-inspiring small selection. 5 entrees? Nothing healthy to eat on the menu at all. We ordered the mussels. They are bad. No really, I dare you to eat them tonight.. sauce is ok at best, and literally the mussels are spoiled. 1 burger selection?

It looks like they repurposed many of the materials used in construction.

We split 2 mussels appetizers (sausage and garlic), both of which were good, but the consensus was the garlic was the best.  I went with the sirloin with cheese.  we also had the cheesy grits side.  i also had the chance to try the fresh beet pasta and pork confit papardelle.  Both were tasty, especially the pork.

First, I love the apps.  The first time I stopped in I had the pickled tomatoes and on my latest visit we tried the deviled eggs.  The appetizers are a great accompaniment to a pre-dinner drink and are enough to hold you over without ruining the meal.  We noticed the tater tots last time we were there and plan to try it next time.  None of the apps are overly fancy, but they're all really good.

As far as the rest of the menu, their focus is definitely on burgers -- which isn't a bad thing, because they're great.  The ""plain"" burger comes with lettuce, tomato, and homemade Russian dressing on a very fluffy and delicious brioche roll.  The add-ons get pricey, but my husband ordered goat cheese on his burger and the amount they gave you was substantial.  I got the cheddar but I actually liked my husband's version better. The cheddar they use is a little saltier than I prefer.

With all of those things said about the food, let's get to the drinks.  I'm a girl who likes to taste the liquor, so the prohibition-style drinks they serve are right up my alley.  They also have a set of ""repeal"" drinks that are fruitier with more mixers.  Every drink is carefully and artfully made and even if it's not something you've had before, you can count on it to be great.  I also found out that they make their own unique bitters concoctions -- definitely something I am now inspired to try on my own.  Finally, they change their drink menu, so there seems to always be something new to try.  Also, if you have an old favorite from a past menu, as long as they have the ingredients (which makes some of the custom ""bitters-of-the-moment"" drinks once and done), they're happy to make it for you.  

In short, just love it.",2012-07-03 23:27:01,"{'food': ['pickled tomatoes', 'deviled eggs', 'tater tots'], 'drink': ['appetizers', 'plain burger', 'goat cheese', 'cheddar', 'repeal drinks', 'bitters']}"

I had prepared some instructions for when we arrived (Example: Wishing the wife a happy birthday, playing some music on the piano and a specific bottle of wine and desert). The staff/servers at the prime rib were very friendly and professional at all times. They followed the instructions I had sent them when I made the reservations online through Open Table. 

The food was excellent, especially the Filet Mignon. The Filet had zero fat and was super tender and cut through like butter. Everything we got was excellent: the steaks, potatoes, fries, and various other sides were all cooked perfectly and were large portions that were enough for 2-3 people to share. The wine selection was decent and varied. There is a bar located towards the front of the restaurant and has a selection of cigars to purchase as well which is a nice touch. 

Service was quick and prompt while at the same time being friendly and providing good suggestions when it comes to wine that compliments your meal. They have a nice selection of liquor and scotch in particular. 

You are required to dress in business formal (Jacket/coat/blazer for guys and a dress/pants for women). I was fine with this and so was the rest of the group. It is more of an upscale or business restaurant that requires you to dress properly and is better for it.

Obviously this place isn't for everyone but even though it can be quite expensive depending on what you get and whether you drink it is worth it. Definitely recommend this place if you want some great food regardless of the high prices. It is worth the extra costs/prices especially if your a fan of Filet or Prime Rib. 

I wish that they had another location closer to were I now live. If only they had a location in King of Prussia so that they could directly compete against Mortons, Ruth Chris, and Sullivans in this area.

I don't drink. You could be giving me the best wine/beer in the world and I wouldn't know how to appreciate it. I also hate patroning establishments who give me small plates of food and charge me a bundle for them. Compounding with my mild claustrophobia and the place is tight especially on a winter's night when everyone has their bulky coats on, it was difficult for me. It's not until my friends told me that the place is legit that I've thought about checking them out and I have to say I truly liked it.

Again, the place is small and there's not a lot of space for you to mosey about, but the waitresses' attentiveness more than make up for it. From the menu, you'll see that some items are quite similar to others, given their small kitchen you'd understand that they can't have really elaborated dishes, but what they do, they do them well. My favorites include their poached figs with gorgonzola and prosciutto, pistachio ricotta and lavendar honey bruschetta and truffled mushroom fontina bruschetta. 

I love, love the categorizing of their wine, cheese and beer menus. Instead of the same old boring categories like red and white, there are more detail descriptions. For cheese, there are racy, stinky and approachable. For beer, there are invigorating, friendly, and profound. I would recommend people to get a cheese plate. I got a plate of 3 cheeses once and they all come with their own little condiment like a fig paste, mustard or toasted almonds that makes the experience so much better. One of the cheeses I had was cut into the shape of a flower, it was stunning and delicious. 

If you come to Tria, do try to come Sunday night to try their Sunday school special. For a little more than half the usual price, you'll get to try a new cheese, a new wine or a new beer.

The crispy, slightly charred grilled country bread served warm contrasted nicely against the cool creamy, orange pimento cheese. 

Course 2:

The corn bread was served in a mini cast iron skillet and topped with melted molasses butter. There was mild sweetness compared to the generous amount salt and meat flavors from the Tasso Ham inside. The bread had firm structure and crumbled into buttery morsels. 

Course #3:

The cajun style catfish was beautifully blackened with a nice crust of salt and spice. The fish was moist and flaky. The dish had complexity with spicy mayo, Beet-pickled cauliflower, okra, and walnuts.

The butternut squash dumplings with fresh slices of granny smith apple and toasted pecans were my favorite dish. The dumplings were smaller making less doughy and more fluffy. The sauce was creamy with plenty of butter. This exactly what autumn should taste like. 

Course #5:

The Fat Ham classed up a Nashville classic ""Hot Chicken.""  The cayenne marinated chicken breast was deep fried to golden brown perfection then served on top on brioche with a creamy herbaceous buttermilk sauce and dill flavored cucumbers. The poultry was spicy ... like really spicy. That goodness for the bread, pickle, and ranch accompaniment. The breaking had above average adherence to the skin and meat. The had boneless chicken was moist and flavorful. 

Course #6:

The Pork Butt was slow cooked and then crisped on a wooden plank. It was less tender and more caramelized. The Gravy was thick and tasty but I wanted more of it. The home fries were cut uniformly and freshly fried with similar delicious qualities. The fresh turnip leaves were a interesting addition. 

Course #7

The Collared greens were supple with a bit of crunch. The pork shank was meaty. The best part was the vinegary, mineral-y potlikker, which is basically the remaining water that boiled the greens. I felt it needed some black eye peas. 

Course #8

The Mac n cheese was served in a shallow rectangular baking dish. The spirals were covered in cheesy creamy sauce with a sprinkle of bread crumbs. The dish was almost too classic for this place. 

Course #9: Dessert: 
 
The Kentucky butter cake was a large square of dense, super moist, almost oozing butter, sponge cake. The three halves of strawberries had slightly sweet syrup. The Chantelle cream was good.

One heads up that I will give is that it can get really hot in there during the summer months. I'm not sure if the AC was broken or if they had it off, but it was just as humid inside as it was outside the day we visited..eeek! 

Since this was our first experience eating Cambodian cuisine, we based our order off of the reviews of other Yelpers and the recommendations from our friendly waiter and ate family style: Prah-hok, Cha mussels, and Cha Kr'ung with Chicken (medium spicy). 
- Prah-hok is ground pork seasoned slightly sweet and spicy, served with an assortment of raw veggies (cucumber, cabbage, eggplant, peppers, and carrots). It is worth trying with a group - perfect portion size to share. The key is to eat it fast and while the pork is still hot. Once it cooled down, the greasy taste from the pork was more apparent. But overall, the fresh veggies balance out the pork and make the dish work.
- The Cha mussels were on the sweet side. If you like sweet sauces, you would probably like this dish. The mussels were large, but because of the flavor, this dish is passable for me though. 
- Cha Kr'ung with Chicken was the highlight of Khmer Kitchen!! Our waiter told us that this was his grandma's specialty and I totally get why! SO GOOD!!! Even though I was full by the time this dish came out, I devoured it. The chicken and veggies were cooked to perfection. The sauce was slightly spicy and made this dish amazing.

First off, the ambiance.  It's a pretty impressive place with an awesome view.  This has already been reviewed in depth, so I'm not going to bother describing it.   We happened to get to our west-facing table right as the sun was going down, which was spectacular.  Try to make a reservation for sundown, if you can.

Food-wise, R2L suffered from what we termed ""bookends"" syndrome - the beginning and end of the meal were excellent, while the entrees left a little to be desired.  I liked the strong wasabi flavor in the tuna flatbread and thought the onion soup's presentation was pretty cool - a thin disk of bread baked around the crock replaced the traditional soggy croutons/toast in the broth.  And Joanna's beet salad was very tasty - as a beet salad connoisseur , she gave it 2 thumbs up.

The entrees though...  I dunno, the veal x-ways didn't really do it for me.  I was sort of surprised, given Chef Stern's reputation as a master of all things calf.  The various preparations all tasted pretty similar, and were a little greasy for my tastes, with the exception of the meatloaf (definitely a highlight).  Jo ordered the short ribs off of the ""Mains: Prepared Simply"" menu and, well, let's just say the menu's name was an understatement.  She thought they were ok, but I thought they were awful, dry and flavorless.  At least she got the delicious shitake fries as a side dish.

Dessert tipped R2L back squarely into 4-star territory.  I seriously considered getting a glass of 30yr Laphroaig, since a) I'd never before seen it available by the glass and b) I want to drink a glass of Laphroaig older than me, and I've only got 3 years left before I have to find some 40- or 50-year .  My old roommate and I have a pact to go buy a bottle of the stuff, and it probably wouldn't have gone that well with a dessert called ""Cinnamon Toast Crunch"", so I decided to just go with the latter. Delicious stuff.

Me and my fiance had dinner here last friday night, and it was a disaster.  For starters, their credit card machine was down (but he failed to mention that until he gave us the bill) and there was general pandemonium from a payment perspective.

This is obviously a minor issue.  But the story continues

Our dinner felt like we were in the middle of a domestic dispute.  The poor waiter guy was the only person on, and he was constantly in heated, loud yelling arguments with ""Fatima"", the chef (and I presume his wife) upstairs in the kitchen.  At least the arguments were in French (how authentic!)

Anyhow, the table next to us ordered a crepe that normally included cheese.  The woman specifically said ""I'm allergic to cheese"" and requested it be left off.  

when he delivered the crepe  the woman said ""I'm sorry, but this still has cheese in it.""  He took the plate upstairs, where there was Armageddon in the kitchen.  I took a little french in high school, and I could make out the following:

server:  Fatima, I forgot to say she was allergic to cheese

Fatima:  I don't care, they still have to pay for it

and various iterations of that until the server came down, shame faced, and tried to give the cheese crepe back to the woman who would obviously have health issues if she ate it.  

THEY MADE HER PAY FOR A REPLACEMENT CREPE BECAUSE THEY SCREWED UP!! inexcusable

i feel bad because the server was having an awful tme (and this kitchen dispute took, no joke, 10 minutes and everyone in the place was silent and uncomfortable for the next 30).  They ran out of cash to make change and it took him 30 minutes to catch up and clear tables after the throwdown with Fatima.

anyhow, to make a long story long, the ""dinner theater"" merely exacerbated  the slow service, lack of credit card machine, and OK food.",2009-11-08 19:37:40,"{'food': ['crepe', 'cheese'], 'drink': []}"

I have been checking out the reviews and giving them a chance to fine tune everything. Basically biding my time and planning the perfect first experience for me and my soon to be favorite burger joint. 

I finally went last week and was pretty disappointed. I had the 500. The burger was salty. Prohibitively salty all over the outside of the patty. I've never tasted anything like it so at first i couldnt put my finger on what was turning me off. Besides that, the tomato slice was mealy and only covered half the patty. The special sauce was scarce. I felt super let down, but i still hadn't gotten to the fries.

I had the truffle fries and i LOVED them... at first. The texture was perfect, the seasoning was just right, but something about the truffle flavor lingered long past it was welcome. It wasnt overwhelming, but truffle flavor permeated the next few bites of burger, sips of (delicious) cherry soda, even stuck around through my after-lunch cigarette. I still tasted truffle in the back of my mouth later that night when i was drinking beers with my friends. It was weird. 

I am giving 500 degrees three stars because i am sure their other fries are yummy. Also i've only gone once and i really want to love this place, so i am going to try again next week.

They are also pretty easy on the eyes and can make a mundane coffee run a tad more exciting.  If you visit the store around closing time (7 p.m.), you can even get free pastries - this happened to a friend and me once.  The location is prime as it is right near Rittenhouse Square.  The interior is somewhat reminiscent of a European coffee house.  The eat-in coffee mugs are colorful and decorative; they also match the blue and red mosaic tables.  

I ordered an iced coffee here once, and a regular hot coffee on another.  They do not add syrups to drinks, so if you want a vanilla latte, you're out of luck.

Ehhh. 

We ordered pastrami Rubens. What did they give us after an absurdly long wait during which neighboring tables that ordered after us got their food and finished eating? Turkey rubens. Now, I don't know if you know this, but turkey and pastrami are not the same thing. One is poultry and the other is pure, unadulterated deliciousness. We pointed this out to the waiter and he apologized and offered to take them back, but at that point we were too hungry and had already waited too long to have him take them back and wait longer for pastrami. Plus, I hate wasting food and sending things back. So we ate them. They tasted pretty good, but not really anything special. Not enough Russian dressing for the amount of turkey, though I suppose we could have asked for extra had we not been afraid that it would take another 15 minutes to come out. He also didn't offer to give us some sort of discount, which is always appreciated when the waiter screws up your order. 

The matzah ball soup was also pretty good, though it also took a while to come out. They must've had some old Jewish yenta painstakingly balling up the matzah in the back. But the wait for the table plus the wait for the food equaled entirely too much waiting, and the food was overall just pretty good. I don't understand the 400+ people creaming their pants over this place. Maybe I ordered (or was given, because that was something else entirely) the wrong thing?

1) He goes out of his way know his customers by name and to get to know them on a personal level.

2) They have a big online and social media presence which is definitely helping their business. 

3) Frank is there morning, noon and night; his wife and kid are also often there too - and they all seem like a really great family which only makes the welcoming appeal of the shop even greater.

4) As soon as the store opened, there was an instant community-oriented vibe. They promote the other businesses and they've gotten involved in local events. They have a local radio show broadcasting out of the store, they've done paint nights, they often bring in breweries for tasting events and they also do first Friday events with special menu items. And even though I missed it, they did an outdoor movie night in the parking lot showing The Sandlot - how cool is that?

My husband got the grilled salmon, which came plated with rice and steamed escarole.  It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, one of the best pieces of salmon I have tasted while dining out in Philadelphia.

There is a lot of space in the restaurant and the servers keep their distance so it is a great place for a business dinner.  For those of you who are not so fortunate to expense this dinner, with entrees costing about $30 ea, you may find pleasure in knowing two tidbits:

I am praying to be reincarnated as that duck I just ate--because to die for such a noble and delicious cause would truly be an honor. 

My husband and I went to Blue Duck to celebrate our anniversary (which was yesterday, but they're not open on mondays, FYI).

I followed them on instagram shortly after his experience and it's been non stop food porn. The beautiful food photography and great branding gave me the impression that this place was detail oriented before I even stepped foot in the door. I checked out the menu beforehand and had my meal all planned out.
 
We started the night off with the Duck Fries--fried in duck fat, topped with melted gouda and shredded duck meat. You could have subbed the fries for human fingers and honestly, the toppings were so good that I still would have eaten it. I was going to get a Cesar Salad because I'm boring and there wasn't much in the way of Gluten Free menu options--and then I heard the specials:

On Tuesday nights they do a Duck Breast special--tonight was a ""Pan-Seared Paprika Spiced Duck Breast with Yellow Rice, Brussels Sprouts, Asparagus and a Curried Tomato Broth. I am at a loss for words. The duck was melt in your mouth amazing--as to be expected, but what caught me off guard was how good the accompanying food was.

You heard that right. Italian food at a hole-in-the-wall Irish Pub. Don't be fooled, your taste buds will thank you. 

I came here with a group of girlfriends. We called ahead, and they advised us to get there early, around 5pm, for dinner. This is the downside of Murph's. It's small, and there's maybe one table in the whole place that can seat more than 4 people comfortably. 

Since our group had 7 people, our waitress informed us that we'd be served family style - double the portion, double the price - so everyone could have a taste. That didn't stop us from going hog. We ordered the Black Truffle Tagliolini, Cheese and Spinach Ravioli, Pear and Honey Fiocchi, and Stuffed Gnocchi, with Fried Buratta and Arancini for our starters. 

Oh. My. God. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. It was so, so, so out of this world. I can't even describe to you how delicious every single item tasted. The flavors and smells of the Black Truffle, the creamy sweet and savory combination of the pear and honey Fiocchi, the enormity of the Arancini balls and Fried Buratta.

Erawan (THIS Erawan, not the other one) is a real treat. I always get the red curry with seitan and/or tofu. And when I come here, I am always blown away. I leave here wanting more. It's so good I have considered ordering two of the same dish. To me, they have the best recipe and method.

Even though I love Erawan slightly more, I go to Tamarind more often. This is honestly mostly due to proximity from my apartment. When I am jonesing for red curry, which is several times a week, it's just easier to get to Tamarind. And if Erawan is a 10, Tamarind is not much lower.

Here are the key differences between my two favorite red curry joints as I see it:

- Tamarind is slightly spicier by default (not a problem, as I can tell Erawan a little hotter than normal, although I really like Erawan's default.)
- Erawan is slightly more flavorful than Tamarind. They really nail it.
- The rice at Erawan is better. It's sticky Jasmine rice cooked perfectly. Not sure what Tamarind uses.
- Tamarind's portion is slightly bigger. I've left Erawan wanting more, which I think adds to my sense of preference. I'd rather leave lusting after my next experience than totally full, so it's not a big deal.
- I don't need to make any vegetable substitutions at Tamarind (At Erawan I have to say hold the eggplant and add broccoli. This is the default at Tamarind.)
- Tamarind has more vegan appetizer selections, and overall those selections are better, but I don't feel the need for an appetizer at Tamarind. At Erawan I really feel like I need something else. But like a good lover, you want more.
- Tamarind is 4 blocks closer to my apartment.

So overall, I end up at Tamarind a bit more frequently. But if I could have the recipe for what either one of these restaurants serve me, I'd choose Erawan's.",2015-05-03 05:16:38,"{'food': ['red curry', 'seitan', 'tofu'], 'drink': []}"

I was a little skeptical because of some of the lower rated reviews, but I have to say, my experience was nothing but great, which is especially unusual for restaurant week when crowds are aplenty and prices go down.

The atmosphere is great - very lowlit and trendy and without being pretentious with white linen tablecloths like some of the more expensive/higher end steakhouses in the city.  Believe it or not, our experience at Marmont FAR exceeded our experience at Butcher & Singer.  (P.S. Did this used to be Red Sky?  The low lighting and arrangement of the place would indicate so).

4 courses for $35 was as follows and not one course disappointed:

Starter soup: Crab Bisque.  I usually hate cream-based soups so I eased my way into this.  Before I knew it, my bowl was gone and I was scraping at the sides for more.  It was creamy, flavorful and delectable.

Appetizer: Fried calamari.  Came in a HEFTY portion for restaurant week and was on point.  Calamari was crispy, not chewy, seasoned well, and that marinara sauce was the bomb.  I've had better in the city, but I was still very pleased.

Entree:  12 oz. NY Strip, requested medium rare.  Actually came out medium rare, which is awesome, and the char/grill/seasoning on the outside was bangin'.  Super flavorful and juicy.  Those chive/garlic mashed potatoes were heavenly.

Dessert: Bread pudding.  It came in a little ramekin and had raisins in it and was butterscotchy and caramely and crunchy and soft all at once - super delish.

Alcohol was pricey (we were treating ourselves, so I didn't care, but I was still like woops, spents more on the wine than I did on the food!  So a $35 per person came to $85 after all was said and done).  Deff worth it though since they had a really expansive wine list and our server was knowledgeable about the wines based on my preference.

Speaking of our server, she was AMAZING!  I wish I can remember her name and give her a shout-out (she was tall and had long hair, if that helps).  Not only was she SO friendly and patient with our 8 person party, but water was always refilled and we never had to flag her down once for more wine.

I ordered for myself the beef shawarma and it was awesome. It had a tahini sauce poured over the meat and also came with a huge portion of pita bread as well.
It was less than 30 dollars for both plates (not including drinks) and we were both very full. 
With each of the meat platters they give you a small Greek salad on the side. The salad had some really good feta cheese and tasted fresh.

After attending the Flower Show on a Tuesday evening we searched the area for a small restaurant with a decent beer selection, and picked Tria Cafe based on the distance from the PA Convention Center (6 blocks) and reviews we read online.  What a great choice it turned out to be!

We thought that visiting on a Tuesday evening would be, but upon arrival around 6:30 PM, the place was full.  We didn't know that Tria was as small as it was, so that helped explain the lack of seating, but they found us a seat at the bar and put us on the list for a table.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive.  We had time to review the menu and each had a beer.  By the time we ordered our second drink the table was ready and we went upstairs.  The upstairs seating was close, but not invasively so.  

We sampled two bruschettas (mozarella crema w/roasted tomato and carmelized onion w/feta), and each had a salad (smoked duck and smoked chicken).  The food was exceptional!  We shared each other's so we got to try two meals and two appetizers.  I can't say which was the best, both were incredible in their own right.

Portion size was modest if you are a huge eater, and ten years ago I probably would have stopped on the way home for burgers. This is not a place where you will be stuffed when you leave, but it was fine for us now, and it left room for both coffee and dessert.  We tried the Olive Oil-Rosemary Cake with Blood Orange Sauce and Mascarpone just because it sounded.....wierd.  It was FANTASTIC!!!

The location is a bit unusual, as other reviews have stated, but it certainly shouldn't keep you away. We parked in the lot at the corner of 23rd and Market and realized while walking to the restaurant that we could've gotten a spot on the street fairly easily, but were happy for the convenience of the lot.

The restaurant itself was lovely. We were greeted with jazz music, a smile and were seated in an area surrounded by windows which gave the feeling of dining al fresco. The beautiful weather only enhanced the effect. 

We were impressed with the flavor of the in house fresh squeezed orange juice in the mimosas and my sister loved the Bisou Bisou cocktail.

It did take a bit longer than expected for our server to bring our bread basket, my sister actually had to ask for it, but once it arrived, the delicious house made strawberry apricot jam swept the wait from our minds. 

I have had a tendency to order that which is familiar with a reluctance to trying new things. This year, I decided to make a concerted effort to change that and Bistro St. Tropez truly rewarded those efforts. 

I ordered the lobster goat cheese tart with roasted red peppers, caramelized onions and micro greens for my starter. This... was the best thing I ate today and quite possibly the best thing I have eaten... ever. 

My entrée was lemon ricotta pancakes with lemon curd, Creme Anglaise and fresh berries. These were a bit of a letdown if I'm being honest. I was expecting a lighter fluffier pancake and these were quite dense. In hindsight, I should have gone with the pain perdu, but I was concerned about the amount of sugar. 

I closed out the meal with the crepes, strawberries and Nutella for dessert which was to die for. Warm, delicate and delicious, these met my every expectation of what they would be.

A word to the wise, do not expect to be in and out. I think the American way of eating out has become so much about turning tables and this was NOT that. Our reservation was for 11:30 and we didn't tuck into our entrées until about 1pm. 

I found this pace to be quite a refreshing change. It was nice to have time to really taste the food, have drinks and talk without a new plate of food being shoved in front of you every 10 minutes.

If you're a germophobe, this place is not for you. Be warned.

Ok, where do I start:

(1) The restaurant is on a side street which is off another side street. So difficult to find if you're not from the area.

(2) We had to wait 15+ minutes despite having reservations and showing up early.

(3) Finally got inside. It's basically a 3-level townhouse thats been converted into a restaurant. Very very dingy and dark inside. They say they have been at this location for 30 years (go figure)... We were part of an unfortunate group that had to climb 2 flights of stairs to have dinner on the 3rd floor (basically in a bedroom of this house). Scary stairs, scary walls. Over-decorated with rugs and stuff on the walls. Everything seemed dusty.

(4) Finally got to the room. There were no dinner tables, just side tables. It's not very comfortable to eat off side tables. Anyway, we sat down.

(5) There was a fixed dinner. Therefore no food menu was provided, because you have no choice in the matter. It is 7-courses, yes. But 7 fixed dishes. The waiter announced to those of us in the room (3 separate parties of 2 people each) what our dinner would be, and that was that. I wasn't expecting this. But there was more shock to be experienced.

(6) All the plates were SHARED. In the LITERAL SENSE. Yes, you heard me. For each of the 7 courses, the waiter would provide the table with ONE large plate of food. You're expected to all dig in and eat off the same plate. No forks, no knives, no side plates. Just one plate in the middle of the table for everyone. So you probably don't want to go to this restaurant with someone you're not comfortable with (either from a germs-perspective, or otherwise).
And by the way, these were not ""finger foods""... We are talking about lamb dishes, spicy chicken dishes with sauces, salads...Yes, SALADS! ....So just to reiterate, you are expected to use your hands for everything AND share off the same plate too. Two layers of freaking out.

(7) At some point, I couldn't take it... so I asked for a fork and a knife... The waiter brought back plastic forks only, no knives. He said there were no knives in the entire restaurant except what the kitchen was using.

(8) Before you eat, they make you wash your hands. They come by each table with a kettle of lukewarm water and pour it over your hands, with a bowl underneath. Yes (you guessed it!), some of this water is splashing into your drinks which have already been served by this time.

(9) They serve a flat bread to eat the dishes with. Waiter walks around with a basket of bread and offers each table. You are to use the bread to pick up the pieces of lamb/chicken/veggies. However, no side plates, remember? So you are expected to place your bread directly on the table. We asked for little plates and they said they didn't have any, but that the table was ""nice and clean""... Yeah, nothing so far had given me confidence that the table was ""nice and clean"". And besides, by this point, the glasses of ice water were forming pools of water around them on the table. So the bread would've been wet if we placed it on the table. So I just held onto my stash of bread the entire dinner. They encourage you to take multiple pieces of bread, because you will use it to eat all the subsequent courses.

(10) Only cash accepted. Again, wasn't expecting this.

(11) Mid-dinner, there was an unexpected belly dancer. Sudden loud music, so we all looked up... and a belly dancer walked in and started dancing in this already crowded, small dingy room. It was unnecessary and interrupted our dinner. Everyone had to stop to watch because the music was deafening and the room was so small (it lasted about 10 minutes). We couldn't carry on our conversation.


And because I don't want to be a hater, I will say that the food actually tasted good. I loved the lamb dish especially. It was a lot of food, it was tasty, and it was reasonably priced.

However, I just did not have a good experience here at all, so it was hard to enjoy the meal. Take-out option might be better.",2015-12-27 14:33:34,"{'food': ['lamb dish', 'spicy chicken dishes with sauces', 'salads'], 'drink': []}"

The service was great - my water cup was never empty - and not to mention, Chef Sbraga was super down to earth and charming. 

I went after enduring 2 hours of lecture, which, of course, warranted a drink (or more). I ordered the Monticello Vineyard (bourbon cocktail) per our waiter's recommendation. I normally don't like bourbon but decided to try it because the waiter was so enthusiastic about it. What a pleasant surprise!! I think I took a sip and then gobbled it down...like a lady of course. 

My friend and I both decided to do the 4 course tasting menu for $49. We both got the fois gras soup for the first course, which was rich and flavorful and wonderfully balanced. Sometimes it is really hard for me to handle more than 2 bites of fois gras but I gobbled down the soup in like 2 seconds...again... ladylike.

For the second course I ordered the Octopus with piri piri and tapenade and my friend ordered gnocchi with escargot in tom ka gai. I was not impressed with the octopus (minus one star), the texture was chewy, and the tapenade overpowered the piri piri. I was expecting extreme heat but all I tasted was olive.

I ordered the meatloaf (signature dish per waiter) and my friend ordered the pappardelle with rabbit for our third course. The meatloaf was a tiny bit on the salty side but the texture was marvelous.

I would say I'd return on a non-hectic day and write a review based on my experience from that, rather than one based on a crazy day such as the Superbowl, but quite frankly, there's about a thousand better bars in the city with great bar food that are more centrally located.  This is not one of them.  However, it is pretty unrivaled as far as sheer size, parking availability, and game viewing goes.  

As for watching the Superbowl: the amount of TVs, fellow cheering Eagles fan camaraderie, celebratory music after every TD and overall atmosphere made it probably one of the best places to view the game and they handled the crowds/checking-in process in spades.  Perhaps the shortcomings in the food were because they were slammed and everything was churned out for the masses and under warmers, but a few experiences years ago here (plus stadium dining) makes me think the food really is just subpar.

With that said, I'd like to first give a shout-out to our amazing server (of course I forget her name now) who took care of us during the entirety of the Superbowl, from about 5 until 10 pm.  I paid $130+ for a seat at a 4-top table to view the game, which boasted all you can eat and drink. I was afraid we'd get a server who would barely come by and make the free-for-all of food and booze sparse.  But she delivered.  Not only did I NEVER have to flag her down for anything, but she brought multiple pitchers of beer to our table so we wouldn't need to keep ordering individual cups (and even immediately put in an order of the crab fries since they're wildly popular).  Food, silverware, napkins, etc. all came timely.  So, no problem there.

The all you can eat menu was obviously limited, but was actually super varied, offering everything from pizzas to the infamous crab fries to mussels to cheesesteaks to crab legs (which was a nice surprise), and so on and so forth.  We ordered (all at once to make it easier on her): one cheese pizza, one roast beef sandwich, one burger with blue cheese & bacon, two orders of crab legs, one order of boneless wings and one regular, and nachos.  Minus the crab legs and the wings, all were underwhelming.  The crab legs (although covered in a kind of annoying garlic butter broth and hence, super messy) were fresh tasting and steamed to perfection so I didn't have to struggle to crack them open.

Everything else was just mehh.  Most nachos were plain with only a few covered in globs of quickly-hardening cheese, sour cream and guac.  Pizza tasted frozen.  Burger was good, but cold.  Fries are too covered in that bay seasoning and that cheese sauce is rubbery tasting.  I felt pretty shitty after eating this and I can equate that to the beer or the food or both but something didn't set quite right.

If you're down at the stadiums and need a place to watch a game, then this is your place.  But if you're looking for really great bar food, skip this altogether.",2018-02-14 19:51:37,"{'food': ['pizza', 'burger', 'fries'], 'drink': []}"

On a tip from pro Yelper Shannon P, we ordered her 3 favorite starters: grilled octopus, lamb dumplings (Manti), and tuna salad. All three were excellent, but my favorite was definitely the lamb dumplings - they were extremely flavorful and I especially enjoyed dipping my bread in the leftover yogurt sauce (I can't help it, I love bread).

We also ordered the dips of the day. One was a hummus, one I forget what it was, and the other was something with anchovies. I hated the anchovy dip, but loved the other two. The pita bread served with the dips was also delicious and perfectly warm.

Next up were the fattoush salad which was very tasty - pomegranate, tomatoes, cucumber, pita chips (interesting) and a bunch of other fun flavors. The only thing I didn't love was that there were a TON of onions, I think too much, but they were easy enough to push some off to the side and still enjoy the salad.

We also had the braised oxtail with cilantro dumplings. I only had a bite, as my boyfriend devoured it, and it was an extremely tasty bite.

I should also add that the service was great here. Our waiter seemed to have a great personality and was very friendly and attentive. My boyfriend got there first and was sat inside, but it was a beautiful evening so after a bit of hesitation and not wanting to be a pain (our wine had already been poured), I asked if we could move outside and there was no issue at all. The hostess and the waiters were very friendly about it.

On my next visit, I would probably order a little less food (we were hungry) and make sure to get some dessert as well (it looked really good at the table next to us).

I always made an excuse, either it was ""too far away"" or I conveniently ""have something else going on"". After reading reviews of previous attempts to hold this event in other neighborhoods I found myself not all that upset that I had missed them. Complaints of long lines, sweltering heat, crazy patrons, etc etc. I didn't really know that I even wanted to go to Chinatown, but given that the weather was supposed to be perfect for a fall evening and it was my home for the first 4 years of my life in Philly, it just seemed like now was the perfect time to give it a go.

I didn't go in with any crazy expectations, I knew that lines would be long so I decided to pay a visit to Chen at Ho Sai Gai, grab a classy cocktail in a coffee cup and head back out into the chaos. My biggest complaint about living in Chinatown was always the smell, most often caused by the leftover fish left in sidewalk trashcans for morning pickup, but last night was different. Chinatown smelled heavenly! Tent after tent, truck after truck, grills, mobile ovens, all serving up signature dishes. Though I wish now that I had devoted more time to developing patience and waiting in some of the longer lines, found myself at tents with short lines but still really great food. A tofu banh mi from QT, empanadas both beef and chicken from Cuba Libre, but the star of the night, my guinness stout chocolate cupcake with bailey's frosting from Sweetbox left me in an overwhelmingly happy state...roofied cupcakes? Probably not, but seriously good.

Other events of noted importance for the evening: the tip to check out the soon-to-open Hop Sing Laundromat, sure there's a lot of hype surrounding this spot, but for good reason...it's going to be awesome. There was also a killer dance party at the Friendship Gate that was shared with some great friends of mine, I have spent almost my entire Philadelphia life in Chinatown and never have I seen people having as great a time as forming a conga line and watching the cute little kids showing off their slick dance moves while swinging sparklers around.

Southgate was on the list for a Saturday night dinner and drinks date for two of us and did not disappoint. The menu is curated and thoughtful - dishes range from accessible to more adventurous and all are delicious.  Wish we had a neighborhood place like this near us back home.

Appetizers:

Koreancini - fried rice balls with sweet corn and a fresh roasted tomato dipping sauce

The special pork buns with honey dipping sauce - soft pillowy buns and slow roasted pork with honey dipping sauce on the side (so filling!)

Chicken wings - sweet, salty, covered in sauce and messy gooey deliciousness (huge portion!)

Entrees:
Tuna hwe dup bap - I had never had this before and it was refreshing, light and a delightful mix of crunchy light vegetable flavored, fresh tuna, sesame oil, rice and a bit of spicy sauce. Yum.

Bulgogi burger - whoa. Rich, buttery bun and perfectly toasted bread, umami salty sweet marinated patty, cucumber pickles and a huge heap of fries. Wow. 

Dessert:
The little flour shortcakes with fresh cream and fresh strawberries and blueberries. We were so stuffed by this point but took this down as well.

Drinks:
We had an amazing local vanilla ale (so refreshing), a beautiful porter, the old boy cocktail (yum!! spirit forward but still tempered by citrus), the p&p, and the Korumbian which had a lovely anise flavor and was not too sweet.

Waters were always filled, service was attentive but not too much so and really really nice, atmosphere was hoppin on a Saturday night but not was not a pretentious crowd. Was a great neighborhood spot and perfectly chill vibe. Plus the chef was owning the kitchen with the open kitchen thing going on - always awesome to see.

My friend and I were lucky enough to snag a spot on the official opening weekend. I've heard that they don't take reservations so we really did luck out getting a seat. Our next stop was Wanderlust down at the Piazza and the fact that we were able to casually dine in our yoga gear wasn't a problem. 

We both ordered the Arugula salad, although I was originally leaning towards the Italian Caesar Salad. Based on the recommendation from the couple next to us and affirmation that the Arugula salad could be prepared without olives, I was sold on the Arugula. Upon bringing out my friend's salad, they had forgotten to prepare mine without the olives. The olives seemed pretty big and unobtrusive so I said it would be okay to leave the olives. Our server was on top of it and already sent mine back. The error was handled seamlessly and with grace. The salad was delicious and I was happy it was prepared to-order after all. I never would have thought that potatoes would go well in a salad, but they worked out quite well. The pesto was more oil based- as in not clumpy as a pesto can be- and made for an excellent dressing. Although not listed on the menu, the small chunks of Parmesan cheese made for a great addition. 

On to the pizza...

My friend and I had ordered one Margherita pie to split since we didn't want to fill up too much before yoga. She had originally debated on getting the Tonno pie however decided against it. This must have confused our server and we were a little confused ourselves when a Tonno pie showed up at our table. As this was an error on their end, we were able to keep the Tonno pie at no charge- score! Another issue handled with grace and professionalism. Ultimately, I did like the Tonno pizza a little better than the Margherita. I figured it would be best to start with the ""basic"" pizza and expand my repertoire from there. The Margherita was a little too simple. Don't get me wrong, simple is not a bad thing. The crust was light, flaky and baked to perfection, the basil was fresh and the cheese was melted perfectly. It just wasn't a life changing experience. The Tonno had that same great crust, but was just a little more exciting. 

As many have already pointed out, the space is small and you are sitting at communal tables. Since this is a pizza joint with a casual atmosphere, I'm okay with that. Next time I'd love to sit by the window seats, complete with a view of Philadelphia skyline. 

The service was fab and we even got to see Mr. Marc Vetri himself hard at work. I've never seen him before so I was quite star struck.

It was blazing hot out, so we wanted to go somewhere with air conditioning where there wouldn't be a wait. Jon's met our needs.

I have to say, I was really surprised by our meal. I got the southwest panini and he got the veggie panini. We each ate half of the other's sandwich, and both panini's were declicious. Like, surprisingly good. The southwest one came with this spicy mayo that I couldn't get enough of. The portion size was PERFECT, which has recently become important to me. We each finished everything on our plates and didn't leave feeling disgustingly stuffed.

On another note, we opted for salads instead of fries or chips, mostly because there were about 15 dressing choices and several piqued my interest. I got the Asian ginger, and it was one of the best dressings I've ever had. He got the pineapple mango, which was decent, but didn't compare to mine.

The one thing that really disappointed me, aside from the unsually loud atmosphere, was the drinks. I got a peach margarita and it tasted just like peach schnapps.

I figured at worst, I'd know not to swing by again, and at best I might have a new shiny watering hole to entertain at.

My beau and I went for a late lunch on Saturday, with a hankering for burgers and whiskey. We were seated fairly quickly; there were only two tables available, and I was surprised at how small the place was inside (if I counted right, 8 tables that could sit 2 each snugly). Our waiter was a touch awkward, but pleasant--let's just say he was polite but didn't go out of his way. After perusing the drink menu (fairly extensive) we opted for a couple cocktails: I got the Sazerac and my friend got the Latin Quarter. Mine was strong, if overly sweet, and lacked the complexity of its subtler ingredients (basically tasted like rye whiskey with sugar, and just a faint, intermittent whiff of lemon zest)--it was ok, but for $13, the execution could have been better. I found my friend's drink just plain undrinkable.

We both ordered pulled pork sandwiches when we saw someone's gray-looking burger walk past: so much for trying the burgers. We also split an order of the duck fat fries.

The fries were.. fries. If I really sat there and focused, I could just barely discern the duck fat, which leads me to believe that the fat was cut very liberally with a clean vegetable oil like canola. They were soft rather than crispy, and could have potentially benefited from a thinner (pommes frites) cut rather than a thicker ""homestyle fry"" cut. Maybe I'm nitpicking, but at $5 for a very small (handful) portion of fries, I'm willing to be critical.

The pulled pork sandwiches looked very Spartan on their plates when they arrived: white plate, sandwich, and 5-7 slices of fried pickle, just sort of artlessly slapped on there. Again, I'm not expecting parsley and lemon twists, but could we at least try to make it look appealing? There was a tiny portion of cole slaw in each sandwich (about 2Tbsp).

Underwhelmed by the presentation, I was nonetheless pleasantly surprised by the actual taste. The brioche bun could have stood being toasted, but stood up admirably to the pulled pork. The pork itself was moist, and the sauce wasn't overdone: not too sweet, not too smoky. I wanted a more assertive barbecue flavor--more char, more mesquite, more porky flavor--and I wanted more cole slaw. The pickles were quite yummy, with a peppery kick.

Final verdict? There was nothing per se glaringly wrong with the meal, but it could have easily been so much better, especially for the money. The drinks fell short, but their whiskey and whisky menu was extensive--I'd say a true aficionado could probably find something of value there. Overall, it seems more like a place to stop by for a drink or two after work with friends you're trying to impress rather than a place to grab a bite on a regular basis.",2010-07-19 20:32:39,

I live right down the street and nothing makes me more excited than a brand new place in walking distance. I have visited the place 3 times and all three times I had, not just bad, but terrible service. The one guy waiter has such a bad attitude and NO sense of humor at all. The hostesses think they are Paris Hilton, piss poor attitudes and such. Two out of the three times our food came out wrong and the third time we had to argue with the waiter to remove the wings from the bill (they never came to the table). Once we were over charged for wine that we did not order. Additionally, the year on the wine menu did not match the year on the bottle that arrived at our table. Any wine lover will know that the difference in the year will change the price of the wine entirely. The servers at Pub and Kitchen do not seem to understand the little things that make a quality customer service experience, they seem to not care at all. Do not even think of asking for a substitution...the first server we had at this place looked like a deer in headlights when we asked for caramelized onions on the burger (instead of the pickled onions), she told us that the chef would ""freak"" if she asked him that. 

The final nail in the coffin for me was on election day. The restaurant has a few very nice flat screen TV's and I asked the server if he could turn on the TV at the bar so I could see the poll results as they came in. He said he would check and came back and said ""no"". I said, ""do the TV's not work?"" He said, yes, they work but wee are not turning them on tonight. I was kinda shocked that on election night the TVs were blank but they are on at all other times during the week. 

So, even though I think the food is pretty good, I am over the attitude at this place. I would rather just walk to 10 Stone or take a few more steps and head into Rittenhouse.

I used to frequent Mixx about 6 years ago, when the all you can eat was $20/pp. Then it was raised to $24 pp, and it just wasn't worth it anymore. All the reviews are right about them stuffing it with rice. I like the AYCE sushi places that allow you to grab one of everything (Minado) rather than a whole ROLL of something. That's why I stopped going. The rolls were stuffed with rice, and it just wasn't worth the $24+ tax anymore.

Last night was my first time back in YEARS. I only went because my other 8 friends wanted to go, so why not.

I still opted not to get the AYCE. I got the nori soup, Yamasai roll, spicy scallop roll and my bf got Roll Combo C for $15. Our whole bill including 18% tip and tax was $51 between the two of us AND we ended up taking almost 10+ pieces home with us.
- Nori soup: 3 stars. Standard, a little salty, but OK
- Yamasai roll: 4 stars - fish was relatively fresh - salmon, avocado and spicy tuna on top
- Spicy Scallop - 4 stars: very tasty :)
- Spicy yellowtail of Roll C: fresh, standard, good
- Tuna Avocado and Alaskan roll were also 3.5 to 4 stars- good standard sushi. I would compare the quality to Vic's in Rittenhouse
* They also put their wasabi in a cute flower form, I love that 
* Service was very friendly. We split out 10 table bill like.. 7 ways, and they didn't mind at all. BYOB is always a plus. For all these reasons they are a SOLID 4 stars

*****TIP*****
 My opinion is that you should only get the AYCE sushi $25pp if you can COMFORTABLY eat more than 24 pieces of sushi. Why? Their maki rolls (hand cut rolls) are very reasonably priced at $5 to $6 a roll. Each roll = 8 pieces. You can get the rolls individually anywhere from $15-$18 for 24 pieces of sushi (which is less than $25) OR you can get the ROLL COMBOs like my bf did for $15 which comes with salad or miso soup.
OR you can get the AYCE if you can comfortably eat 2 of the special rolls bc they are priced at $10-$13 a roll.

In my opinion, I left without feeling like I had to stuff my face on the verge of throwing up because they charge $1 for anything you don't finish eating. All my friends felt like puking, sleeping, dying afterwards. My bf and I enjoyed an amazing meal, with friendly service, with leftovers, OH and i forgot to mention our $51 dollar bill included mochi for dessert too!

The Hotel itself was fine.  Nice staff, clean room and being it's a boutique hotel. it doesn't take a hike to get from the elevator to your hotel room.  

What will keep me from staying at the Palomar Philadelphia in the future is Square 1682.  While the staff is more than nice, the food itself was horrid, and just one waiter working during Monday breakfast ( ~ 8 am) made a coffee refill wishful thinking.

Let me take a step back.

I arrived at the Hotel Palomar on Sunday around 1 pm, checked in and came downstairs for a quick bite to eat before heading to the Convention Center.

The menu was somewhat sparse being a Brunch menu with a handful of lunch items.  I ordered a vegetable frittata (hold the cheese) with the house potatoes.  Oddly, the frittata did not come with toast, which is a bit odd for an egg entree.

However, the no toast wasn't the issue.  What was an issue was that the frittata came with a coat of grease over the top.  Because I was absolutely famished and had to get to meetings, I woofed it down.  The house potatoes on the other hand were simply inedible.  They were cold and laden in salt.  I took 3 bites and left the majority of the potatoes over.

The next morning I decided to play it safe and order 2 poached eggs, a toasted English muffin and instead of the potatoes, asked for a side of fruit.  I'm happy to say that my eggs were cooked to order (which is the only reason I'm giving this review 2 stars instead of 1).  As I previously mentioned, one waiter on duty for a Monday breakfast meant that service, while very friendly, was lacking.

My reason for choosing the Hotel Palomar over other hotels in the area was due to the very good reviews I read about Square 1682 online.  This includes the fact that they were the winner of the 2012 Open Table Diners Choice notation.

The cuisine itself is familiarly Southeast Asian, but with a different emphasis. The bright balance of Vietnamese food can still be found in the bitter flower salad (THE BEST!) or the ginger mussels (CAN THIS ALSO BE THE BEST?), but a lot of the menu is quite different.

We arrivedat 4:22 and we were starving!  The hostess sat us at a table for 2 which was so small that we didn't know how both our plates would fit on the table at the same time. I asked the hostess if we could sit at the larger table next to us and she told us no (even though at 4:30 they open up the upstairs portion of the restaurant for dinner where there were several more tables).  We sat down at our cramped table. The waitress came to take our drink order. We both ordered water. She brought us 2 glasses and some water in a glass container. it was about 80 degrees that day and the water was warm. no ice in the glasses. When we looked at the menu, we saw that it was the 'snack menu'. Apparently, you don't get a regular dinner menu until 4:30. While a little annoyed since we only had 5 mins to go, we knew we were only ordering salads so we didn't make an issue of it. We placed our order: a chopped salad and a Caesar salad, both with grilled chicken added (both were ricdiculously priced). and then we waited... and waited....and waited.... after a half an hour, we were pretty annoyed and started looking around for someone. At that point, I noticed there were 2 salads that had been sitting on the counter for quite some time. People have been walking by them, servers have been talking over them, one server was leaning against the counter right next to one of them.  Around this time the manager came over and told us that they lost our ticket and they were correcting the issue now. (i can only assume is that they basically forgot to cook our chicken, even though we were watching the cooks in the kitchen sweep, clean up and converse with each other).  At this point , even after we pointed out that we have been waiting half an hour for SALADS, the manager never offered us anything for the inconvience. Not a drink, not an appetizer, not even some bread for the table. (i should also mention that in all this time our waitress never even came back to check on us so that we could ask for some ice for our warm water). I asked the manager if the salads I have been looking at for quite some time were ours and he said 'yes'. i told him we didnt want salads that have been sitting there so long and people were talking and gesturing over. He said ""if you don't want them, then you don't have to take them"". We told him we don't want them and that we were going to go. He just walked away, no apologies, no attempt to get us to stay.

for those that do not read chinese, unfortunately, the authentic dishes are only listed in chinese on the back of the menu.  some items will appear on the english pages but not much.

here is what we ordered:  

1.  taiwanese oyster pancake ($6.95). it definitely did not come close nightmarket quality.  it was passable and more ""homestyle.""  it seems like no one really knows the secret behind the red sauce so most places outside of taiwan use a ketchup/soy sauce mixture.  empress garden is no different.  the oysters i thought were non-existent.  but the starch mixture had a decent crisp.

2.  taiwanese crystal meatball (ba wan) ($3.95).  the outershell was ok.  the meat filling could use bigger chunks of meat and some bamboo shoots.

3.  scallion pancakes ($3.95).  one of the best scallion pancake i've ever had.  it's more deep-fried than pan-fried tasting.  i'm not sure why they bring out a vinegar dipping sauce with it though.

3.  steamed rice with braised ground pork (lu rou fan) ($6.95).  eh...  it was okay.  really overpriced for a bowl of rice, even if it's a big bowl of rice.  don't get me wrong, it is quite tasty but just not authentic enough (meat is too lean and sauce is not greasy enough).

4.  mango smoothie and red bean smoothie ($3 each).  both were delicious!  not too sweet and full of flavor.  i liked how they served the drink in a glass rather than a plastic cup.

overall, i am only commenting on the dishes i tried.  i thought they tasted fine but were not quite authentic.  my friend who grew up in taiwan was pretty disappointed but comparing taiwan with empress garden is not really fair.  on its own, i think empress garden does a nice job offering something different in philadelphia.

Food/Drink - I started with a Sunset boulevard (i think it was called) a champagne drink, which was good and my friend stuck with wine all night which she enjoyed. She couldn't decide between two options so the waitress let her sample some before she chose which she appreciated. 
The food was overall very good. We started with the Gnocco Fritto which was one of my favorite things. I've never had this before so I didn't know what to expect. They were hollowed pastry shells with a side of the mortadella and onion jam. I wasn't sure how to eat it so we tore the shells apart, stuffed them with the meat and slathered jam on everything. So good. I'd get this again in a heartbeat. 
We also split the Pierogi with Panna cotta and caviar. This was also good. The creamy panna cotta and the salty caviar over the pierogi was very enjoyable. I'd get this again also.
For mains, we split the Ricotta Ravioli and the Salmon. The ravioli was easily my least favorite thing. If it had rosemary in it, we couldn't taste it. The hazelnuts gave it a nice texture but compared to the other 3 dishes we had it was just underwhelming. The salmon was fantastic. It had a nice charred skin and was cooked just as it should have been. The BEST part of the salmon is the crispy brussles sprouts with the soy balsamic glaze. It was the tastiest part of the entire meal and I almost licked that part of my plate clean. There was a decent serving of it on the plate but i wanted more. So good.
Finally for dessert we ordered the carrot cake sundae which was 2 scoops of cream cheese ice cream with some wet walnuts. We didn't finish this and it wasn't worth ordering. 
Overall, 3.5 stars a nice experience. This would've been a solid 4 stars without the water, 20% less attentive staff (which I feel is an odd thing to say but its just how I felt) and had we passed on dessert. We paid a little over $100/person (with tip) for water, 2 drinks each, split 2 appetizers, 2 mains and dessert. If I ever find myself back there, I'd probably re-order the GnoccoFritto and Salmon.  
I'd definitely pass on the $1 water.",2017-11-25 15:01:10,"{'food': ['Gnocco Fritto', 'Pierogi', 'Ricotta Ravioli', 'Salmon'], 'drink': ['Champagne', 'Wine']}"

I only wish that a dozen more of these locations would pop up conveniently located near my apartment, my boyfriend's apartment, my hometown, my job, all of my friends' places, etc...

As a non-meat eater, it has been driving me crazy being unable to find a quality establishment at which to order quick, cheap, meat-free food that ISN'T a mozzarella-tomato panini or pizza. Don't get me wrong; I love those, but I really do crave quality food that is actually able to offer a wide range of options. Hip City Veg is exactly what I've been looking for and I am so glad I've found it!

Now for the specifics...

The Chick'n Ranch sandwich actually angered me at first because it was my first time at Hig City Veg and I was absolutely convinced that I had been given real chicken. It tasted EXACTLY like real fried chicken! It was crazy! Now I didn't become a vegetarian (""pescetarian"") to go eating meat-free food that tastes exactly like meat, but this was so delicious I do not care. By far the best meat free chick'n I have ever, ever had.

Their green lemonade is fantastic and refreshing! Just try it.

The Philly cheese steak is really great. Its made up mostly of mushrooms, and although I'm not a huge mushroom fan, I still loved it.

Their veggie burger is really just OK. Tasty, but not the best I've had. I really prefer the veggie burgers that seem to combine lovely things like beans, seeds, and the like into crumbly wonderfulness (Village Whiskey does a great job at this). I think they were going for more of a beef-like veggie burger, but didn't pull it off quite as well as they did for the chick'n. I still have to give this place five stars though because, as you may be able to tell, I'm slightly crazy about it.

The person on the phone was kind and professional and gave me a reasonable timeline. I ordered a breakfast platter (french toast, bacon & potatoes) with a side of eggs. totaling $15.60. He told me it would be about an hour. Well, 90 mins later, the delivery guy shows up, I hand him a 20, he says ""thanks"" and begins to walk away, He notices me still standing in the door way and says ""oh did you want change"" I said, just give me 2.00. He opened his wallet and says, ""I only have 5s... sorry"". I told him don't worry about it... mostly because I didn't have any other change and I didn't want to leave him without a tip, even though he was a half hour late. After that frustrating encounter, I called and politely let the gentlemen on the phone know what happened, he assure me that it would never happen again and the he would speak with the delivery guy. I finally sat down and opened my breakfast, NO BACON!!! They left out the bacon and STILL charged me an extra $3.50 for the eggs. Unfortunately, between the 30min late delivery, being taken for almost 5 bucks and still not getting what I ordered, I don't think I will be ordering here again.

The sausage and meatball pizza was a thigh-clenching rainstorm of yum. (The margherita was a distant second.) The orecchiette was homemade and so good I slapped myself across the face with every incredulous bite. The eggplant parm appetizer was also nice -- not the typical prep (more like fried involtini) though pleasant as clouds of ricotta made snug into thin fried eggplant sheets, rolled, then doused with red sauce. (Personally I prefer the classic style, but I was hardly facing a bubbling cheese shortage at the table.) 

Bread to nosh was a la reliable Sarcone's and it came with two solid dipping sauces, olive oli & butter and a pesto-ish version. Service was prompt, friendly and efficient; the booth seating was very cozy and a great way to hang out, gossip, and share plates; bread was refilled before we thought to ask, food was fresh and hot, and the wine flowed freely. The caesar was fine, not amazing, but good as a side crunch and there was plenty to share. I think we whined to ourselves that there was no fresh-ground pepper. But I was too busy stuffing my bra with succulent sausage pizza to give a damn.

In all, if you're looking for great homemade pizza in town: absolutely ignore Barbuzzo, whose pizza is drearily thin, soggy, and out-of-balance. Go instead to Rocchino's -- pizza or pasta, it's perfection.",2012-01-09 03:04:50,"{'food': ['sausage and meatball pizza', 'omelette', 'eggplant parm appetizer', 'bread'], 'drink': ['wine']}"

The waitstaff is impeccable.  They were on point for all of our questions and helped guide us from course to course.

Here is the play by play:
First course: 
Him: Pork Belly - really spicy but good/Her: seasonal Heirloom tomato salad - refreshing. Is this what tomatoes are supposed to taste like?
Second course:
Him: Can't remember/Her: Escargot pasta - The lemon saved the dish, otherwise a bit boring
Third course:
Him: Brisket - amazing and tender/Her: The roast pork with provolone bread pudding - a deconstructed and fancy way to eat a Philly classic.  Very flavorful
Fourth course:
Him: Dirt pudding - best dish of the night.  It is proof that if simple is done right, it can be amazing/Her: Apple dish with granita - the granita was not my favorite, but the rest was good.

Overall it was a good experience. It was just missing that one magic moment that usually comes from restaurants of this caliber.  You know that moment, where your eyes roll into the back of your head and you know you are never going to eat this good again.

I think this place has a cool vibe and I could see myself coming back here.  There is ample space so you don't feel cramped and the service staff seemed quite professional.

We saddled up at the downstairs bar for a little bourbon tasting.  They have a pretty extensive bourbon menu which I was impressed with.  I went with the Evan Williams Single Barrel which was pretty awesome.

After the bunch of us were about to leave, the bartender asked us if we had been ""upstairs"" yet.  Apparently upstairs they have a whiskey bar, live band, awesome lounge area, shuffleboard and darts.  Yeah, the upstairs is where it's at in this spot.  We ended up staying decently late watching people dance (rockabilly) and playing some mean shuffleboard.
