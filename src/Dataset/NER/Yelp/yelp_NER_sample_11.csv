It is not in Center City, or one of the City's many restaurant hot spots, but rather at 4th & Girard.  They bill themselves as a Regional Mexican place, but the menu seems to be broader than just Mexico.  They have an open kitchen, so you can see the meal preparations and it is a BYOB - so bring your wine, beer, or as many do, your own tequila and make Margaritas.   The prices are reasonable and the menu is extensive.  The Shrimp Ceviche is great and I love their Camarrones Chipotle (Jumbo shrimp marinated in olive oil and garlic topped with chipotle sauce).  We also ordered a Fiesta Platter, which is just that - a fiesta of many delicious Mexican appetizers (Chicken Empanada, Taco Dorado, Cheese Quesadilla, and more) - they say for 4, but it also makes a fun entre!  The Guacamole Ranchero is delicious and their Cochinita Pibl (braised pork shoulder) melts in your mouth.  Street parking is usually no problem and the vibe is casual and comfortable.

 Sure, the food took a long time to come out, and one entree arrived about 15 minutes after the other, but we can deal with that.  But just after we finally got our food, there came a COCKROACH crawling up the wall next to our table!  We told the waiter and he took a napkin and squashed it.  Then he split, without the slightest apology. Despite that, we decided to suck it up and continue our meals. Not 1 minute later ANOTHER cockroach appeared, this time on one of the PLATES containing our food!  Needless to say, that was just too much. We all got up to leave, and I asked to see the manager. The workers that we told said the manager ""just left"". Our waiter was nowhere to be found, either. (I suspect they were one and the same guy.) One of the workers (a woman) said ""they (the cockroaches) come from upstairs"". So obviously this is an ongoing problem. We received not the slightest apology from anyone.

Google showed me that it wasn't the contestant I'd been thinking of, but I was still curious enough to want to try the place. The wait was close to 45 minutes as estimated, and we eventually got a small table by the window. For lack of supply our table wasn't equipped with the same set of hot sauces as the neighboring tables. Margarita flavors of the day were strawberry or mango, and a pitcher of the latter pleasantly sloshed us by the end of dinner.

I was sad to see that their menu online hadn't been updated with the recent changes. While I understand that it's a pain to keep stock for a vegetarian ingredient that isn't present in any other dishes, I'd been really looking forward to the cactus and sweet potato burrito. Which reminds me, I haven't seen a neighborhood so vegetarian-friendly in a long time. John was gung-ho about what appetizers we were going to get, so I let him take charge of those while I picked out our entrees. Given the amount of food we were about to indulge in, we opted to pass on the endless chips and salsa. As strongly as his roommate recommended the barbecue, I was pretty realistic about our consumption of food and chalked the pork belly off for a later visit.

I've never seen fried pickle chips cut so thick (a hefty quarter-inch), and the texture was right on the border between cuke and pickle. The spicy chili mayo it came with was an okay pairing, nothing special. Of everything on our table it was the least spectacular, and as a result it was the only thing we left unfinished.

The single order of veggie wings with ranch sauce arrived at the same time as the other app. Celery and carrot sticks were acceptably fresh, though the celery was the lower quality of the two. The seitan was sliced thin and fried to crisps before tossed in buffalo wing sauce. An interesting plate that I was content to eat, but definitely takes an open-minded palate to appreciate. Not sure that I'd get this again, but I'd be tempted to make this at home if I went herbivore.

Since the shrimp and chorizo burritos each came as a pair, we traded our spares to share the entree experience. The radish slices were nice to have, but I was unimpressed by the jicama cabbage slaw. I think my main criticism is that the tortillas tasted straight out of the package. I would've enjoyed each bite more had an attempt been made to lightly grill the wrappers. The chorizo was my favorite of the two; instead of pineapple, it's now served with roasted red potatoes that give it a fantastic rustic flavor. The wedge lime lightened the heaviness of the burrito, and I could totally picture this as an amazing breakfast burrito if scrambled egg were included. The shrimp burrito tasted of very fresh ingredients, but citrus wasn't present enough to make the seafood really pop. Sadly, this made the room-temperature tortilla overwhelm the light flavor of the shrimp.

Service was friendly enough to come by to top off our glasses for us despite the packed crowd and the pitcher being right there for our own dispensation. Two bathrooms behind the ATM/cigarette machines, surprisingly clean and tagged with random graffiti that actually fits right in with the feel of the place. The art on the windows made me smile, and the hubbub was too noisy for me to make out the TVs by the bar.

So it's a no-brainer that the GF and I would check out Juniper Commons, his 80's themed outpost across the street. The GF loves any themed concept, but I'm down with any Chef that can turn out a deliciously decadent foie gras soup.

So we pushed past all the negativity surrounding the supposedly regressive concept and decided to stop by for a pre-theater dinner. Some say the 1980s was one of the ugliest decades for decor, but the design here was still sleek and open. They even have a fire pit in the open kitchen - perfect to roast a prime rib or a 32 oz. steak.

Bread Service
Zucchini bread

Service started off with some zucchini bread, provided with a pat of butter topped with sea salt. Moist and studded with raisins and walnuts, this was a delicious, yet surprisingly sweet start to the meal. 

Pimm's Cup [$12]
Pimms, lemon, cucumber, strawberry

The GF can't be denied her Pimm's Cup and Juniper Commons' iteration was appropriately fruity, light, and refreshing.

Point Breeze [$12]
Bluecoat gin, grapefruit, rose 

Considering the name of the restaurant and the theme, you'd expect a great gin program which Juniper Commons has in spades. This tipple featured Philly-based Bluecoat. The floral notes were rendered more complex with the addition of grapefruit and rose. Himalayan pink salt studded the rim.

Peel n' Eat Shrimp Cocktail [$15]
Cocktail sauce, lemon

These Florida Sun shrimp were nicely poached, shell-on. The GF wasn't a fan of working for her food, but we both enjoyed these substantial and snappy crustaceans nonetheless. The accompanying cocktail sauce was sweet, with a nice horseradish kick.

Fried Smelts [$8]
Chili pepper aioli, lemon

While not exactly this year's pork belly, you do see fried smelts gaining ground. And why not? It's the perfect salty bar snack for those who enjoy fish. Head-on, these fishy fries were aggressively seasoned and had a thin, crisp batter, with the bones within offering even more texture. The chili pepper aioli had some acid and kick to balance out the weight of the flaky and meaty fish. 

Eggplant Fritters [$16]
Eggplant relish, mozzarella curds, pomodoro sauce    

This dish was definitely redolent with the components of eggplant parm. The pomodoro sauce was well developed with the fresh herbs providing additional flavor. The mozzarella curds were chewy nuggets of gold. Still, the eggplant was inconsistently cooked. The relish was great - well roasted and packed with seasoning. But a few of the crispy fritters showcased eggplant that was extremely chewy and gummy, rather than tender. A decent dish that could have been better executed.
 
Lobster Roll [$26]
Mayo, celery salt, drawn butter, chives, potato roll

On the other hand, the GF's lobster roll was top notch. It doesn't get better than a perfectly buttered and toasted potato roll, packed with huge chunks of sweet lobster with minimal dressing. A pat of pickled veggies provided some balance between bites. Almost overshadowing the lobster roll were the beef fat fries. Thick-cut and properly fried, each bite was lightly crisp, yet melted upon mastication. In fact, one of the servers who stopped by to chat described them as being seductive. Considered me seduced.

Pinot Noir Wine Cooler [$9]
Apple brandy, blackberry 

There wasn't a dessert menu on hand, but of the few offerings rattled off by our server, none seemed to surpass our need for a Salty Pimp from Big Gay Ice Cream next door. Still, I had to end the meal with one of Juniper Commons' wine coolers - bottled in-house, sparkling, and slightly chilled. This was easy drinking - light fruit with a brandy buttress. 

Service as a whole was very good, with a friendly hostess and a manager that stopped by to check on things. While there were some inconsistencies in the eggplant dish, everything else was well-executed and delicious. For the naysayers, I don't think the point is to blow you away with creative twists on classics. They're classics for a reason. The lobster rolls are done right and their raw bar is fresh. I highly recommend popping in during Happy Hour for some fried smelts and a drink or two. Lastly, you're failing at life if you don't order the beef-fat fries.",2015-05-29 14:20:42,

I've tried multiple dishes from here including their home style tofu, vegetable soup, lamb dishes, and their sliced tofu with grounded pork.

Luckily, they allow you to customize the spicy levels.

This includes my interaction with doormen, checkin, concierge, housekeeping, restaurant, bell service, room service and restaurant. I can't think of any place else I've stayed where the staff was consistently this nice. 

The King Deluxe was comfortable and had windows overlooking downtown on two sides - although I didn't spend much time looking out. Being able to look directly into several offices in a nearby building was just plain weird. Figuring those office workers could look back, I kept the curtains closed.

Here are some of my favorite menu:
1. Special monster rolls (my favorite. It is so good that we ordered the second one) 
2. Tuna (in small platter section)
3. Surf and turf ( this is a special menu and it was awesome!!! It consist of perfectly cooked medium rare wagyu beef and seared scallop) 
4. Seared scallops (in small platter section)
5. sunomono (good for light appetizer but some may think that it is not that great compared to other alternatives but I still like it) 
6.uni sashimi is awesome. (But if u don't like sashimi then u might want to skip this. Their scent can be strong for those who are not used to uni) 
7. Pan seared scallop (large plate section. I think this menu is good but not great as compared to other menu I just recommended but if u are a scallop fan like I am, you will like this menu too since the scallops are served with mashed taro blended with potato and some vegetable purée which is so good)

1. Passyunk avenue roll
2. Tuna wasabi salsa

It's an issue that consumes my soul and is constantly hanging over my head, and gives me great unrest. But I find ways around it, and Sbraga's been on my to do list for a while, so I made it happen. I was saving my $50 gift certificate from Opentable (after months of making reservations for everything, finally, a payoff!) for a long time, and after careful consideration, decided on Sbraga for my birthday dinner (with a 9:00 reservation on a Monday that would get me another 1000 points, obviously).

I had extremely high expectations... and they were exceeded, starting with the birthday card from Chef Sbraga that graced my table upon my arrival. The service was impeccable and everything we ate was incredible (I'll get to that later).

I wasn't going to review Sbraga, but I recently revisited (free dinner courtesy of Opentable...it pays to read emails!) and realized I just can't stop talking about it or recommending it to people, so I should weigh in on the ole Yelp.

THE FOOD. 
OMG the food. Here are the highlights from my two visits.

--The Foie Gras Soup. 
Perfect combination of richness and spice, and just awesome. I still think about this. I don't care if you don't like foie gras, never had it, or are iffy about. You should order this, and you will like it. I promise. 

--Pork Belly in Chili Oil
Very thinly sliced, but great combination of flavors and not too spicy at all.

--Gem lettuce...with other stuff.
Basically a deconstructed Caesar salad. The red peppery looking things were really the highlight. Very good.

--Steak tartar 
Also awesome, can't remember specific details.

--Octopus in Piri Piri sauce
Not as spicy as other Yelpers led me to believe, so fear not; also excellent.

--Papardelle was really good too.

--The Lamb was very good but a bit salty for my taste.

-- ""Key Lime Pie""-kind of a deconstructed delicious take on the classic, and the Pistachio Bread Pudding with Olive Oil Ice cream (super interesting flavor, and my roomate who hates normally ice cream loved it!) Not a huge dessert person, but places like Sbraga change me...

--Special shoutout to the popovers. I would like for them to pop over to me anytime.

When I made the reservation, I told them it was our first anniversary. They gave us a table with an AMAZING view of the city. Our waitress could not have been nicer- she really went out of her way to make our night special. They brought us each a glass of champagne to toast, and some challah bread with whipped butter for the table. For our appetizer, we started out with the Grilled Truffle Flatbread, which was DELICIOUS! We then each had the Romaine salad, which was also very good. For our entrees, I had the Horseradish and Pepper-rubbed Tuna Loin, and my husband who is vegetarian, had the Saffron Papardelle. For dessert, we ordered Variations of Chocolate and the Donut Ice Cream Sandwich-both of which were amazing (they even wrote ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate on the dessert plates). Needless to say, we were quite full when we left.

For the people who are complaining about the prices, please stop. You know going into this place that it's not the Olive Garden- hello!- it has it's own private elevator with a concierge who greets you and directs you where to go!  It's an upscale, hip restaurant that has been frequented by local celebs (Chase Utley lives in the building). You get what you pay for.

While I don't think most people could afford to go here regularly, this is definitely a place I would return to for a special occasion. Our waitress and the rest of the staff really went out of their way to make sure we had a wonderful evening.

While the beer selection is not quite as fly as Eulogy across the street, the Khyber has a lot of excellent American choices on tap.  And amazingly, those choices ran the gamut of white beers, fruity beers, barley wines and stouts with only a couple of them being loaded up with hops.  The current trend for everything on tap to be either super hopped up or a pale ale does not apply here.  Lots of very interesting stuff to try, such as a watermelon flavored beer.  There is also quite a wide bottled selection, but with at least 30 choices on tap I didn't even have to go to the bottle menu.  

Servers are friendly and refreshingly free of ""attitude"".  We had no problem snagging a table for 2 on a nice Saturday evening, or getting served in a timely manner.  Big plus over Eulogy where the service is not quite as fast or friendly.

The food menu is heavy on stuff like hot sausage, bbq and soul food, with a few vegan options.  It was OK but I wish there was more of the standard bar food like, for instance, boring ol' french fries (they did have nachos).

Hundreds of craft beers from around the world, and a knowledgeable, helpful staff (a little more lively at night, though).  While run-of-the-mill domestics are offered, if you're looking to pick up a few cans, avoid the the narrow isles and expensive distractions and head for a deli.  Skip this place on a weekend evening.

In detail: Agreed, depending on the brewery, the beer can be very expensive.  But when you're purchasing limited Belgian beer by the bottle, that's what you have to look forward to. A bottle of Chimay and St. Bernardus ran me $15.  And I'm hardly complaining at all. If it's a top-notch beer, then the sticker shock shouldn't be so shocking.

The Foodery practices exceptional beer care, and uses the appropriate lighting in their cases to prevent skunked brew.  Additionally, you can request a warm bottle if you plan on cellaring it, or if you just like it at room temperature.

I've been to the Foodery many times when I had no idea what I was in the market for.  If you're going to gaze or don't have a game plan, try stopping in here on a weekday in the afternoon.  As soon as a few customers enter, the aisles jam.  Visit when you can take the time to move case-by-case and find something you had no idea existed.  As mentioned above, avoid the Foodery on a Friday or Saturday night.  The perfect beer can call to you if some stooge reeking of malt liquor is bumping into you trying to find a tall boy of Olde English.

My advice for first timers is this: refer to the price guide in the back of the store, and mix-a-six (purchase six different beers) to save a few bucks.  If you need a recommendation, ask.  You'll be overwhelmed with variety.  I asked the bald-headed guy with glasses about local breweries, and learned more than I could possibly retain.  A true beer guru.

I gave the WSW Foodery a 4/5.  I suppose I envision a beer museum with wide luxurious aisles, price tags below every bottle, and a Trappist monk at the register.  Knowing I can't have this, the Foodery suffices, and does a damn good job at it.",2009-03-18 21:57:44,

Honestly, I've walked by this stretch on Market Street a dozen times and never even noticed there was a steakhouse right there.

Marmont's has a cool vibe and a really interesting interior.  My favorite was the illuminated floor when you first walk in - very cool!  The drink listing was pretty interesting and they had some good craft beers on the list, so we went the beer route.

From the restaurant week menu, we both got the crab bisque, which was awesome.  Big hunks of crab in a delicious bisque.  If this was any indication for the rest of the meal, then we were in for a treat.  For the appetizers, we got the calamari and the cheese steak egg rolls.  I'm not really sure why there were so many compliments on Yelp for the calamari - it was fried beyond recognition.  Literally just tasted like fried batter.  Not a fan.  The cheese steak egg rolls were awesome!  I've had these several places, but Marmont's are the best I had.  So much cheese!  So good!  I highly recommend these.

Moving on to the entrees, I got the NY strip (rare) and he got the ribeye (medium).  Both steaks come out cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Absolutely fantastic!  And the portions were very generous for a restaurant week menu.  The dish came with mashed potatoes that can only be described as complete rubbish.  I just pushed them away and devoured the steak.  We were both really pleased and FULL.

For dessert, we both got the chocolate cake.  He loved it, I thought it was dry.  Whatever - it's a steak house!  I got what I wanted.

I'm not sure I'd go back to Marmont's when it wasn't restaurant week, bc it's a little pricey, but I'd definitely consider going there again if I got some sort of deal or something.

- Dan Dan Noodles - there's a reason why this is their signature dish! The noodles are perfectly cooked and slightly chewy, and the waiter mixes the noodles/sauce right in front of you. In fact when I don't have this for a few months, I actually start to get cravings.
- Szechuan Fish - it's hard to find a restaurant that makes fish well in Szechuan style. This one is perfect because the spiciness doesn't over-burden the taste of the fish. The fish is cooked really well and the pieces fall apart perfectly.

Don't like anything dry pot style - it's so dry and spicy that I can't actually taste anything else during the meal..or for the rest of the day for that matter. Also don't really like the double cooked pork - comes out too 50% of the time and chewy to the point that it's hard to eat.

The waitress was awesome.  She seemed to be happy working there, so good.  

We ordered the tomato soup first.  It was an awesome purée, but they should probably mention by word of mouth or on the menu that it is purely half jalapeño purée.  We even inquired about it.  Mouth on fire, and far too much heat for a simple soup(in my opinion).  It could have been amazing, having a nice consistency. 

The bangers and mash looked like a plate of sludge.  Couldn't look at it.
I ordered the burger medium rare; nothing fancy.  Came out gray, rock solid, and greasy.  The meat tasted bad, too.  Really, poor quality.  I asked the waitress for a new one medium rare...at this point I'm starving. 
She politely apologized and took it away.

Let's get right to it. 

Our server Megan was excellent. Poised, warm and knowledgeable. All the little things that add up to adding confidence about the rest of the meal. Total professional and we were grateful for the care that came throughout the meal. They will be smart to hold onto her. 

Having met Ben (Manager) and Kevin (...yeah the Chef) in their table visits I believe they will. I hope they are going for a warm and inviting feel, because that's what we got. Nobody called Chef by his title, just Kevin. It is a nice touch and the way they just walk up and say hi is genuine. I'm sure they know but it is important to say these things. I'm rooting for them and want to encourage them to never stop visiting guests. It is right on so many levels.

Food:

Beet appetizer, Miso Cod, Meatloaf and Hot Chocolate dessert were the standouts from the four course tasting we did. Here is the breakdown if it interests you:

Beets are center cut and sweet accompanied by a streusel with sweet and salty cheese. Texture, sweet and salty it just rocks. 

My fiance had the Cod and it was so good that it brought back memories of a hawaiian trip and Miso butterfish that actually had her wipe a tear away.  We literally talked about the smell of the yard at her Grandmother's house in the childhood memory talk. 

The fish is that good. It was 'buttery melt-in-your-mouth' The Kim Chi was super hot! But right there was the apple to cool it down. So like three part harmony.

Meatloaf was so rich and sweet 'vinegary' that I was laughing and looking over my shoulder before dropping profanity about it being the ""motherF'ing truth."" It is comfort food but rich and dense with herbs throughout and no filler. Don't bread that meatloaf, I don't want the breading and they didn't. Most definitely a refined portion so I see they aren't going for a big old slab of comfort food. Instead they are going for comfort-refined. 

Hot chocolate is that comforting decadence that has a lava cake sort of theme. I mean it is a good thing we walked home afterward because we needed to burn it off. 

It was a harmonic experience. Atmosphere, staff, food and everything all came together and made each other part even better. I guess even the covers of tunes we knew now make even more sense. They are going for that thing you always knew but hadn't had so good.

Starting with the positives of the food. The many options of beef, bison, elk, and boar (and some vegan options) were fun to look through and left our table of 3 with one black bean, one elk, and one boar burger. We split up the 2 meat burgers to share between the carnivores.

The food was excellent. The large order of fries (for the table and not as individual sides) were plenty for us to share and the sauces were very tasty. The side of spicy pickles however were disappointingly not spicy. There was a hint of horseradish but that was it.

The portions of the burgers themselves were quite small and left me feeling kind of hungry after (including the fires). Also, the black bean burger did not impress the vegan in our group. He decided to have the burger in a collard leaf to be gluten-free but I feel like this just eliminates the whole idea of it being a burger.

Service was also underwhelming as the staff wasn't particularly attentive (say with the water and making sure the orders were fulfilled - we had to ask about a side that didn't come at first). Also, our party of 3 was seated at one of the booths which didn't seem to be designed for more than 2 (one on each side). I ended up feeling a little like I was sitting on the edge.

Discounts for Jeff ID holders was nice but everything seemed overpriced which we attributed to the whole organic only thing. But even counting that we felt the burger portions were too small and the overall total was too high for still feeling hungry afterwards.

Sadly I will not likely go again.

I was in charge on planning, which I fail miserably. Originally,  the plan was to go out for food, drink,  and karaoke. I thought about Tango,  yakitori boy, and k top. Didn't know that you have to call weeks in advance to book a private karaoke room.  As you might have guessed,  all room were booked. 
The only other places in Chinatown that I know that serve food and has private karaoke room are ken seafood and red kings 2. 

I read other yelper reviews. Apparently,  you have to order at least $200 in food to get a private karaoke room at ken seafood. I didn't think it was worth it for a party of 5. On top of that,  I didn't really like their food there from my previous experience.  

When I called red kings up,  The requirement was at least $165 for food. 
I guess I would be ok with the $165 if I hadn't found out that at Tango,  The room is FREE if you order at least $50 worth of food.  

Long story short,  my cousins and I decided to go to red kings, but skip the karaoke room.  
We got there around 8.  The dining room wasn't busy at all.  When we placed our order,  the food came out fast.
We ordered slice beef tendon in chilly oil (cold app). Chinese spinach,  chicken griddle dish,  spicy crab, and fry fish ( don't remember what kind of fish it was) in hot and sour sauce. 
For a Sichuan restaurant,  I was expecting my mouth to feel numb after dinner due to all the chilly pepper and spices they use.  However,  It wasn't that bad! 

One of my cousin loved the food so much,  She wanted to go back again the next day. 
The second time around,  We pretty much order the same dishes, but with a few addition new dishes. 
The new dishes were the double cooked chicken,  hot and sour soup,  and beef tendon stir fried with spinach.  They messed up the beef tendon dish. Instead of spinach,  It was bean sprout. I was a lil hesitant to eat that considering that I just read an article about salmonella outbreak from bean sprout.  There were some cases from Pennsylvania!!!! 


Overall,  The second time around,  i thought the food was just OK. It wasn't as good as the day before.  Maybe it was wayyyyy too soon to come back to the restaurant?  Maybe our body hasn't fully digest the food from yesterday?  Or perhaps our taste buds haven't had the chance to recover from all the spices from the previous night....

Whatever the reason may be, Everyone thought the dishes were spicier than the night before.",2014-12-01 13:55:19,

This isn't any kind of hunger - it's the kind that produces migraines, incessant growling noises and/or lightheadedness, the kind that makes you want to cry , vomit and scream all at once. 

No! No! Not that kind! Any kind but that! 

I am, of course, speaking of the unrivalled Hunger preceding Sunday morning brunch also known as ""Sunday Brunch Hunger""*

I can never tell if it's my hungover stomach's need for grease or the inordinate amount of time one waits to finally get a table, but I know that NO MATTER WHAT I fear starvation by the time I place my order. Although consistently painful, this recurring Hunger episode is simultaneously rewarding--that very first bite is, in that moment, absolute heaven.

Enough about Hunger. What about Honey's? 

Things I liked: the potato latke, the fresh ingredients exploding from my build-your-own omelet, the friendly ambiance and service, the layover at the random tea house.

Things I didn't like: a surreptitious charge for maple syrup, applesauce & sour cream (at least it felt that way: ""would you like applesauce with your latke?"" ""yes please"" (unspoken) ah! i love when they say yes, now I get to charge them extra!), the walkie talkie miscommunication between the tea house and Honey's which resulted in our table being given away + an extra 20 minute wait (yeah, take that aforementioned Hunger up a notch).

The food was pretty fantastic and I'll definitely return, but I'm docking a star for the logistical failures.

*I understand that Sunday Brunch Hunger may at times result in skewed opinions of the quality of brunch foods. However, I have been through this ordeal on several occasions and can say with confidence that the food may be fairly judged after bite #7 (aka the point at which one exits starvation evasion mode and becomes a real human being again).",2011-02-16 19:39:03,"{'food': ['potato latke', 'build-your-own omelet'], 'drink': []}"

So, I came in the other night and it was quite busy. The staff was very helpful even though there was a bunch of fraternity brothers yelling out their orders and asking numerous questions. A cheery college aged girl who took care of most of my order explained how the sauces may taste given that there were soo many options to choose from, so that was nice. I ordered a mix of white and dark chicken with chipotle lime mayo and this yellow curry sauce. I prefer the dark as it was much juicier. 

I think it will be hard for me to try the other sauces since I was pretty pleased with the chipotle lime mayo which was both smokey and fresh tasting while the curry was on the sweeter side, so I really enjoyed the difference in my sauce flavors. 

Luckily, I had enough room for just one of their pies. They had many on display and from what I was told they bake them all in house. I chose the chocolate peanut butter one and boy did that feeel good. I'm a big chocolate girl, so I'm not sure I was surprised that I loved it. As for my drink, I just asked for some water.

Perhaps their best, however, is the roast pork, with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe. It's perfect through and through. Great roll, meat is as tender as possible, great cheese, perfectly executed broccoli rabe--it's just awesome. Plus, there will never be an insane wait.

After we all placed our orders, the appetizers just began to flow.  Calamari, stuffed long hots, sausage and peppers, and a house salad with vinaigrette.  Then came the entrees, both the filet and lamb chop popsicle were amazing, they were both served with asparagus and potatoes in various forms (mashed and diced). 

Finally dessert, tiramasu, which everyone seemed to enjoy.  I unfortunately can't stand it for some reason.

Since I am often solo, the wait is usually not too bad as single spots at the counter open up pretty quick. When I have come here with my girlfriend it is an entirely different story and we have had to wait upwards of 45 minutes. That being said, there are some things in my opinion that make it definitely worth the wait. 

The fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious and if you do sit at the counter you get the added bonus of watching the juicer do its thing, which can be entertaining. 

They put blueberry compote on the tables instead of jelly/jam and it is the perfect compliment to their delicious biscuits (probably the best biscuits I've ever had). I have noticed that the taste/quality of the compote varies quite a bit. I am not sure if this is driven by slight variations in the different batches they make, or if it is an indication of how long ago it was made. 

I usually opt for an omelet and they are always enormous. Some of the ingredient combinations work out better than others, but that is based on personal preference. The last one I had was spinach, feta cheese, and tomatoes and it was amazing. 

Their home-fried potatoes and potato latkes are also very good and I find myself switching between the 2 based on my mood that day.

I asked for mustard and received on the side a mixture of exquisitely creamy and delicious  grainy mustard and creme fraiche. It was the finest burger I have ever eaten, and I've eaten at Boulud's and many 4-star restaurants all over the country.

My son ordered a burger with caramelized onion, fried egg, and bleu cheese. He said the flavor was amazing, but the combination made it very sloppy and difficult to handle.

My husband and I took the kids for dinner...we started out wanting to go to PYT (we could sit outside and enjoy the weather and the kids could be crazy and loud and mix in with the music) We passed by Chenango and saw there was outside seating and had just talked about this place.
I sent my husband inside first to see if our kids could come in and eat. They were more than happy to have us as there was a total of 2 other tables in the whole place.(the pool looked pretty dead too) We sat outside (I loved the feel...layed back and casual). Our waiter happily came over to greet us and tell us about the happy hour specials (score!). My husband and I ordered the house sangria and hummus for the ap.
Ten minutes later our waiter came over and said they were out of sangria mix (really there is a mix...and there were only 5 other people in this place at 6pm) and asked if we would like something else. So we chose something else...whatever I just wanted a drink and food.
Our drinks finally arrived another 10 minutes later and we put in our food order (a pizza for the kids and a burger and crabcake sandwich).
After about another 30 minutes our dinner arrived. I was kind of shocked as my hummus ap was no where to be found!
I started to cut my burger in half and noticed the thin patty was already cut into two pieces (really you couldn't temp a thin beef  patty without cutting it) but on a large bun (too much bread).
It was a good burger...I mean not PYT but still good...I ate the whole thing.
The kids also enjoyed their pizza (how can 5 year olds not enjoy pizza). As for the crabcake sandwich I will not review it as I did not taste it...I do however know my husband sent it back and ordered the Burger instead and a side of fingerling potato salad.
The hummus finally arrived after I finished my burger....I ate it as I was still hungry. It was good and the pits is pizza dough(great flavor) the only thing I didn't ""like"" ablut the hummus is they put the roasted peppars, olives and feta chese on top of the hummus instead of on the side(had I known this was how it came I wuld have said no olives).
My husbands burger came in record time and undercooked but her ate it anyway (he was starving and we had beeb there too long) and the fingerling potato salad was dry and could have used more seasoning.
As we were trying to finish everything the chef came out of the kitchen and appologized (as had the waiter already appologized) and said he had just made some fresh desserts and was sending them to our table.
Let me tell you...these desserts saved Chenango from 2 stars! Where did these desserts come from.....the chef has got to be trained in desserts!
The lemon sorbet with raspberries was amazing....he also had 2 different frozen deserts one chocolate and one i can't remember but it was fantastic.

nqzqkk_59TozZ-pnQrUOaQ,eMLCACo452chulFiRwTNjg,F8yozE3NWnImNApHO347gQ,5,5,3,2,"Holy spanks - this place has got to be the best kept secret in the Philadelphia food scene.  I can't believe it has taken me so long to get here.  The life I was leading before experiencing dinner at Marrakesh now seems dull and grey; and, the food I've had since then.... sub-par. (I jest, of course- my brother is a wicked awesome chef and indulges me from time to time with culinary treats.)  In all seriousness though, this place puts the ""Oh my god this place is fantastic!"" into that old saying ""Oh my god this place is fantastic!""

You enter by knocking on this beautiful but unassuming door on a little side street. (I actually couldn't figure it out at first and said  ""open sesame"" only to hear someone laugh behind me and use the knocker... Sufficiently embarrassed before the meal - check.). The owner opens the door which is similar to that closet thing in Narnia, because when you step through it, you are actually IN Morocco.  Like actually - no joke.  Travel these days is getting pretty impressive - amiright?!

Anyways, the decor inside is visually stunning.  Everything is gold or burgundy it dark red... And there are pictures and sconces and drapey fabrics all over the walls. It's really beautiful and brings a whole other element to your dining experience - and like other reviewers before me have said, this really is an experience.  Once you sit down, someone comes and washes your hands with ROSE WATER. I shit you not, actual rose water (side note: having ""shit"" and ""rose"" in the same sentence made me think of that song by Outkast... So it is now playing in the background as my inspiration yelp-review music). My hands smelled so good after I almost didn't want to sully them with the good food we were about to imbibe in.  Almost.  

You are served 7 courses of some of the most decadent and delicious food anyone could offer you.  A bunch of other people have already described what you are served, so I won't bother - but I will say it was positively divine.  Our group couldn't stop eating anything until they physically took it away from the table, and we really should have considering the copious amounts of food we were given.

Lastly - food never tastes as good as it really is if you have scheisty service. That was certainly NOT the case here.  I actually think the owner (who comes and talks to you throughout the meal to make sure you are enjoying yourself) is clairvoyant.  There was never one point in the meal when we waited longer than a millisecond with an empty water glass or no bread.  The staff there is really spectacular.  I can think of a handful of places that would do well to hire them to teach their own employees what it means to be a really good wait staff.

Bottom line (and closing to this novel of a review) get your ass and everyone you know to Marrakesh for dinner.  Your friends will be paying tribute to you for the rest of your life of you are the one to introduce them to this gem. (And lets get real - tribute swag is always good. Always.)

First order I had the beef and broccoli with a hot and sour soup. The portions are large, enough to have three full meals from a single entree.

The hot and sour soup was tasty, maybe a little more liquid than some I've had before, and has the addition of mushrooms, which was nice, but unexpected.

The second time, I went with the chicken and broccoli with brown rice and this dish stood out. The chicken is all white meat with no fat or tendons. The brown rice is a nice addition where you have a hint of the husks, but tastes great. Once again, huge portions will allow me to enjoy the dish for a few more days.

The staff is friendly. I'm able to order my food and pick it up 15 minutes later. So far, had not had an issue with my order, which is nice change compared to some other local eat-outs.

1) Since I am an Asian American, I have obviously never not been ethic. As such, I have always wondered (to this day) what non-ethnic people eat on a regular basis. I've also been puzzled as to why someone would choose to pay significant sums of money to eat ""traditional American"" food when they can opt for the much more colorful cuisines of Asia, Italy, Latin America, or basically any other part of the world. (Except maybe England. Talk about dullsville. Which is honestly why I have not yet given Dandelion a fair chance.)

2) Apparently I am exceedingly impressionable. Case in point: The Internet told me that today is National Waffle Day. Even though this very well might have been a false proclamation and even though I have never historically been a waffle nut, I could not get the image of waffles out of my already cluttered mind. So, being unable to function with this thought persistently nagging me, I dropped everything and dragged my lunch party over to Jones.

Even taking Fact 1 into consideration, I am actually very okay that Fact 2 is true because let's face it, the chicken and waffle at Jones is awesome. Like seriously awesome. The chicken (even the white meat) is perfectly juicy, and the waffle has an expert balance of crisp and fluff, all drizzled over (or on the side!) with a creamy, flavorful gravy. My only complaint is that the chicken to waffle ratio is highly skewed toward the chicken side (the waffle is delish - give us more!). Also, I think Jones might be the only restaurant in the entire nation that dares to charge you MORE for ordering all dark meat instead of a mix. Slightly uncool, Steve.

The mac and cheese is definitely in the ""instant knock out"" category of food. It is tasty for sure, but a bit salty and incredibly heavy. A good recommendation for insomniacs - a few mouthfuls will get your eyelids droopy in an instant. I'm not typically one who gets off at the idea of spending over five bucks on mac, and this is no exception. For this kind of price (at eight bucks a pop), I think I'd rather get it at Silk City. 

Overall, the food at Jones is decent, even in spite of its lack of ethnic flare, though it can be more than I would like to pay for this style of food. It looks and feels exactly like Stephen Starr would have it look and feel. It is not my favorite of his joints, but it is not my least favorite either (you can ask me which one that is, and I will tell you why). Solid 3.5 in my book.

""Meh. I've experienced better"" is right.  I've experienced better from Holiday Inn Express and that's not to denigrate Holiday Inn Express .  I was really pretty disappointed with this hotel.  First of all... Loews has a great reputation (as far as I had heard) and second, I paid a lot.  When I pay a lot I do expect more from my stay.  These are a list of the things I don't expect when spending over a thousand dollars.

1.) Being checked into a room I didn't reserve.  I am by myself, I don't want a room with two double beds, nor did I reserve one.  Come on!

2.) Being given a room with big paint (or maybe Spackle) splotches on the walls in several locations.

3.) Routinely being given false information on business location and hours by the concierge team.

4.) Furniture that has seen it's day come and go.  Drawers that are partially of hinges so that it's always getting caught on other drawers, etc...

5.) Wi-fi - inaccessible.

6.) I was there for a conference and on several occasions they changed the location of a session but did not put up any sort of signage as to it's new location.

7.) Additionally, in most ever session it was a struggle to hear what the presenters were saying because the audio for the neighboring rooms were bleeding in. 

8.) Bad information about the airport shuttle... luckily I was so ready to get out of that place that I was way ahead of schedule.  If it was a typical trip I probably would have missed my flight.     

I understand that this might not look like much but put them all together (and believe me, there's was more) and you just get an crap experience.

Time to call Allegro's. This 28 inch monstrosity is not only one of the biggest pies in Philadelphia, it's one of the best (and it's under $25). Their regular sized pies are just as fresh and good, but really, can you ever have enough of a good thing? If you aren't in a pizza mood they have a wide variety of italian entrees which are outstanding (I'd do unspeakable things for the Penne Alfredo), and the serving sizes are more than generous. Each entree comes with a garlic knot and a salad, or soup (go with the soup!), and I can promise you that if you eat your side soup/salad before the entree first will have enough left over for a complete second meal.

Maybe italian isn't your thing, no worries, just order a hoagie or a chicken Caesar Salad (choose the salad!) and prepare to be blown away. My fiancee and I made the mistake of getting a grilled chicken Caesar for each of us once and immediately regretted our decision due to how big they were. One salad can EASILY feed two people (with leftovers) and if they put less than two chicken breasts on top I'd be surprised. The lettuce was crisp, the vegetables flavorful, the cheese was freshly grated, and the chicken was perfectly marinated.

We started with the dips of the day, which were traditional hummus, a potato garlic dip and a pumpkin feta dip. They were all great, but the pumpkin feta was out of this world good. The wife and I were trying to figure out the ingredients so that we could replicate it at home. For my main breakfast dish, I went with the homemade lamb merguez sausage and duck egg, which also included some spicy cured pepperoni and spicy yogurt. The wife chose the cumin scented tomato and pepper stew with poached eggs and grilled bread.  Both plates were beautiful and delicious.

For dessert (yes, we made room), we got the fillo pastry filled with semolina custard and the coconut/date/hazelnut  cake. The perfect end to the perfect breakfast.

At the end of the Italian market, right next to Sarcones, sits a 116 year old establishment - Ralphs. This is not a big fancy restaurant, just an intimate, home style, Italian eatery. Yeah so the service isn't great - who gives a hoot. If you're looking for 5 star service go to one of the chain steakhouses. The servers are reminiscent of any of my Italian family members, what do you want, ok, here you go. Little bit of brashness, some wise ass sarcasm, but it's all part of the fun. The place is small, and you sit on top of the other diners - but maybe you'll make a friend or two while you're there - we did.
We didn't get any appetizers, they're not really needed. You start off with a nice basket of bread from next door - some butter, olive oil, and parmesan - just the appetizer you need. We all ordered different dishes of different complexities, and all pleased (some more than others). 

I had the Veal Saltimbocca which was absolutely fantastic. The marsala sauce was creamy and delicious, the veal tender and juicy, and the prosciutto on top just made the dish. My wife had the Chicken Francaise, which was also tender, juicy, creamy, and delicious. My mother had the Brachoile, which was just like Grandmas. My father had the Veal Parmesan, which while good, was topped by the other dishes. Each of our dishes were served with spaghetti and red sauce on the side. The red sauce was deceivingly delicious for how bright it is (usually a darker sauce has a bit more flavor). Being 4 people who have high expectations for sauce, we all agreed that Ralphs hit the mark. We were also delivered another basket of bread - this one better than the first as it was coated with sesame seeds, which is our favorite. 

We had a bottle of Ruffino Chianti, which was excellent, and then a half carafe of their house chianti - which was obviously not as good, but still 'a solid house wine' as our waiter elegantly put. 

We finished the meal with 2 massive cannoli's, which were also fantastic. The shell was probably one of the best we've ever had, and the filling was creamy and delicious. I also had an espresso (romano - i.e. with lemon) which was a nice accompaniment to the sweet cannoli. 

Ralphs has a very 'home cooking' feel to their food. It tastes like something your grandmother would make, and I am totally thrilled with that. They don't try and go over the top with the dishes (i.e. any amazing plating or tricky flavor pairings), but they sure do have their recipes perfected for their dishes. 

I have to give Ralphs 5 stars for the great ambiance and excellent food, if we're in the are we will definitely return... even though I got a parking ticket.",2016-06-13 15:44:41,"{'food': ['Veal Saltimbocca', 'Chicken Francaise', 'Brachoile', 'Veal Parmesan'], 'drink': ['Ruffino Chianti', 'Ralphs house chianti']}"

We ordered roasted lamb shoulder, corn bread, and country potatoes. Fancy stuff, easy on the palate, and pretty much all gone.  The meat was juicy and tender. Very, very good!

The beer list is amazing with a ton of choices of drafts and bottles, and they also had some classic cocktails.  I ordered one of the boiler makers (the Virginia), and it was interesting. You are given a beer and a shot of liquor to enjoy side by side. It was something different, and something I would try again!

It came with coleslaw and spicy bourbon mustard.  

I have to give the win to HD as far as the taste of the hot dog goes.  It had a really great flavor, and I loved the grilled texture.  But I was not a big fan of the bun and the topping to dog ratio.  I ended up pulling off a lot of this bun because there was just too much of it.  Also, the bun is not toasted.  As for fries, they are def good, but not as crispy as would I have liked.  I tried the HD special sauce which was a tasty accompaniment.

The food arrived quickly and if you asked me who our server was, I'd never be able to tell you. I think about 5 different people serviced the table. Fine by me.

If only one complaint, I'd appreciate a larger beer selection. They have the standard domestic fare (Bud, Yuengling, etc) but are lacking on the imports (Heineken doesn't really count). I settled for the Tsing Tao.

Tried the pork spring roll appetizer ($6) pretty tasty; Hubby had a crabcake sandwich ($13) and I had a burger with boursin and braised onions ($10). Both were good if not memorable...I liked the spicy cilantro fries that came with my burger though the ones that came with the crab cake weren't as good.

The atmosphere is a rustic county vibe with mason jars and tons of exposed wood. Most of the wait staff was tattooed and bearded. The restaurant is pretty similar to the east falls taproom. 

The beer menu is pretty good, and same with the cocktail list. However, they have their beer special on a side wall where the  tables are, and above the bar. It's in an awkward place because if your sitting against the wall with the chalkboard you can't see the boards. Maybe they could have it on both sides. Anyways, the beer selection is pretty good, and same with the cocktail menu. My boyfriend and his parents where able to try several new beers.

My boyfriend's mother had the salmon specials. It was plated strangely. It had farro and salmon on it. Then the other 2/3 of the plate where empty. They probably could have sacrificed a couple vegetables to complete the special. 

My boyfriend' father had the Kansas City sirloin. It was an oddest strip steak I have seen. It was cut in a circular fashion, and it was extremely thick instead of the typically longer with medium thickness that's who it's typically served. Either way, he throughly enjoyed the steak, and it was cooked to his desired well. 

My boyfriend had the burger. He devoured it. It was pretty impressive watching him wade through the bacon, ketchup, and beef. 

I had the anson mills shrimp and grits. It was  awesome that they served heritage corn. I fully support the activities of Anson mills supporting farming that relies traditional methods and grains. Anyways, the grits had a hint of cheese, and a decent amount of shrimp. Love the cast iron plating! There was so many grits couldn't finish it.

They messed up the sirloin order so it came late. It was surprising since it wasn't too busy. The waiter apologized profusely. They also gave up a free dessert, which was quickly consumed with glee.

My parents usually take me to my restaurant of choice back in Detroit and I go bananas. This year, however, was my first birthday actually spent in Philly as a resident of Philly, meaning Mike was on birthday duty. I couldn't really decide where to go, but a love for Ralph's runs through his family, as it came highly recommended by his parents and was also a destination on his brother's bachelor party tour of Philadelphia (I see you, brother), so I wanted to see what the dilly was.

We rolled up and were sat without a reservation relatively quickly. The guys working all had on Phillies t-shirts, which was cute.

I entered a brief state of panic, but then I asked the server about it and he used CONTEXT CLUES gave me the vegetarian sauce to accompany my vegetarian entree and Mike the meat sauce to accompany his meaty entree. How thoughtful. He was a really nice guy, on top of it. Quick, but not short. You can tell they care about service.

The food was delicious and eeeexactly what I wanted. Everything was excellent, down to the diet soda.

I came here with a group of friends this weekend (6 of us total) because I didn't want to try getting in at one of the usual brunch spots and having to wait for hours. Seating was easy, and we pushed together a few tables to accommodate everyone.

However, the food choices are a little strange and not extremely descriptive. I split the jalepeno cornbread and the mushroom frittata with my boyfriend. Both main items were extremely small (like 5 bites) and came with a small arugula side salad. All the flavors were just okay. For $9 each, I felt like the price point wasn't quite right, especially for this neighborhood. One friend ordered a green tea cupcake that came out very hard and dry, like it had been made days ago. The best-looking dish by far was a vegan sandwich off the lunch menu.

We have never before tried Cambodian food and were not familiar with any in the city.  An online search took us to the corner of 6th and Morris in South Philadelphia.  Like several other unusual Asian restaurants this is just a small place, clean, bright and unpretentious. But it did have lovely live roses on the tables.  Our young waiter was a great help to us. My guess is that he is American born and a so a bridge between two worlds.  As such he was a great help to us in selecting our lunch and explaining everything about how to enjoy or afternoon at the table.  One thing to know is that even though the menu at Khmer Kitchen divides dishes into ""appetizers,"" ""traditional,"" ""meats,"" etc. All dishes are served at the same time: a method that is most common in most Asian community restaurants. We have now ceased to try to ask for the soup before the main. It just doesn't happen. Everything is on the table at once and you pick as you go. 
But to our lunch. Our first selection as appetizer (although it arrived with everything else) was the mussels in a ginger sauce.  While we actually did not get to them until a bit later, the mussels appetizer took your tastes to an experience of a sea with salty sweetness and spice: an absolute delight worthy of the finest gourmet kitchen.  From the advice of our serve we also had before us a soup of tiny eggplant, read peppers, celery and chicken in a curried broth and also a dish of ground pork served with a variety of raw vegetables.  The soup surpassed anything you might imagine: an entirely new taste enhanced by wondrously crisp fresh vegetables. The ground pork, our server explained to us, should be eater like a vegetable dip by touching the vegetables into the pork mix. Once again, the crispy raw vegetables mounted with the sweet and salty pork took the tongue to heaven.  By the way, if you prefer spicy, they will give you a little dish of finely sliced red peppers. But beware. One of those mini-slices goes quite a long way.
Now to Khmer (Cambodian) table manners. The first thing we noticed was that the table setting had no chopsticks but only a fork and spoon. This seemed a bit odd. But then we stealthily observed the Khmer families around us. It seemed that you use the fork to push the rice and accompaniment onto your spoon.  Then the spoon, and only the spoon, was raised to the mouth.  It also seemed that for certain things, you could use your fingers.
Cost wise, Khmer Kitchen is slightly more expensive than other community Asian restaurants, but only by a minimal margin. The bill comes to a little more than ten dollars per person, per course. If interesting and different cuisine interest you, make an excursion to Khmer Kitchen.

I got the mixed garden vegetable noodle bowl with vermicelli noodles and extra shrimp dumplings. The broth was so mild it could have doubled as warm water. I added soy sauce, but the water/broth was so flavorless the soy was powerless against it. The vegetables were equally under-seasoned, like they were boiled in water and then served. There was no flavor for the noodles to absorb. Is there no shoyu, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, etc in their kitchen? I found myself thinking ""well, the menu didn't specifically say there would be seasoning. Maybe I was wrong to assume they would add flavor."" My husband suggested that maybe someone in the kitchen mixed up water & broth. Either way, I won't be back.

So crispy on the outside and just soft in middle, with just the right amount of salt and pepper on them.

The customer service this time was extraordinary! First, my wife and I went in with only about 15 minutes to go to closing time (on Xmas eve!), but the waiters were kind enough to request us to come in and have the buffet nevertheless. They kept the buffet open for a few minutes after closing time, allowing us to refill our plates. And once they closed the buffet, they brought dessert out specially for us right at our table. And throughout all of this, they were very friendly, courteous, and didn't make us feel hurried in the least. I've rarely experienced such a complete turnaround in customer service!

The food was also excellent: I've always liked their buffet's panner/chicken masalas and the palak paneer, but this time they also had a very delicious navratan korma (which thankfully wasn't sweet!).

Unless you're flush with mucho dineiro, this place is a once-every-few-years-special-occasion kind of restaurant. Regardless of how perfect a dining experience is, it's always a little painful to fork out over $600 (with tip) for a meal for two. Go with someone you love (or someone else that will pick up the tab, unless that's one and the same) who is not a picky eater (aside: is there anything worse than a picky eater?) and that has a real appreciation for vino.

When you go here, you have to go all out.  Since you're shelling it out already, you might as well go full steam ahead.  Go for the Grand tasting menu with the grand wine pairings that will seriously blow your mind.  To be honest, I almost enjoyed the wine more than I did the food (more on that, later).  The staff here are so well-versed in their wine selections, it was a pleasure to hear them describe each pairing with detail and authority.  Once you are able to marry both that wine and the food, you know you have arrived.

The highlights, are, of course as everyone says, the pasta.  Rich, but light, earthy, fresh, buttery, and oh so succulent.  It takes everything in your body and good upbringing to restrain yourself from scarfing it down in two bites (although the portions are just that, two to three bites worth - or five to six conservative bites).

Everything here is well-conceived, perfectly executed and beautifully presented.  The staff is a dream.  Everything from the amuse-bouche, to the meal procession, wine service, pre-dessert, dessert and send-off is effortless and lovely.  And for that price tag, it should be.

This meal never had a low point for me, the preparation, taste and execution was consistent, right down to the fudge they send home with you.  The truly high point of the meal, are the Grand wine pairings.  Simply put: out of this world.   Maybe, that is the true test of master chef, a menu where the food and wine dance impeccably together and bring the best out of each other.  However, there were times where the wine clearly outshone the food, both in complexity and depth - and I often wanted more of the wine than I did of the food -- and I cannot believe that's the intended reaction a chef would like me to have (putting my obvious love of wine, aside, I do love food more).

So including that, the other things which are holding me back from awarding Vetri the full five stars that it definitely deserves in the grand scheme of Philadelphia restaurants are that for starters-  at the price point that Vetri charges, I would have appreciated a couple extra courses, and perhaps a palate cleanser half-way through the meal would have been nice as well.  I had no problem with the portion sizes or the duration of the dinner, but when pre-dessert came, I was not ready for the meal to be over.  I thought I deserved and paid for just a little more.  Also, as I noted in the beginning, in a town where gourmet eateries of Vetri's caliber are offering similar fare but at a more affordable cost, shouldn't Vetri strive to offer more or offer what they have to cost a little less?  My two cents.

Either way, a worthy Philly dining experience.  Warm up your credit card (or two).",2011-04-25 19:40:25,"{'food': ['pasta'], 'drink': []}"

In Riva has been on my list for a while to try. Usually there's a certain level of hype that goes along with anything I've put on a ""to-try"" list. A lot of times lately, I've left a little disappointed. Not today!  And not to sound trite, it seriously was love at first bite. 

A casual lunch meeting brought me to In Riva today. My group of three sat outside on the deck overlooking Kelly Drive. It was sunny but there was a nice breeze in the air. The view of drive was simply picturesque. If this wasn't a work meeting I would have been all over the photos! 

We started with the Burrata & Kale salad for the table. Aside from burrata and kale, as the same suggests, it also had pecorino and hazelnut. It was large and beautifully plated. It was fresh, crisp and oh so enjoyable. It was the perfect size for sharing as an appetizer as well. 

I went with the Bianco Verde pie which just automatically made its way to the TOP of my gourmet pizza list. It consisted of goat cheese, pesto and garlic almond. The crust was light and flaky. Not too doughy but not too crisp. I don't throw around the word perfect too much when describing an actual item of food, but it was perfect. The ingredients were balanced proportionally and the execution went off without a hitch. Between the salad and knowing I have dinner plans for the evening, I called it after 3 slices and had the other 3 boxed to go home. Otherwise, I probably would have stuffed myself silly and made a scene going for every last crumb. 

**Next day cold, leftovers update. The pizza is still amazing but in a different way (that only cold pizza could be). After having the flavors chill out together overnight, the spices really have popped. I can really taste the rosemary that wasn't as noticeable yesterday. Yea, I'm in love. I'll need to go back soon. 

The service was great too. For a casual spot during a business lunch, our server gave us an appropriate amount of attention. She was there when we needed her, checked on us at the right times and kept the dining process moving along. 

I couldn't even make it off the block before taking a picture of my leftovers. Moments after the photo, I was on the phone with my mom telling her about it. I went back to the office and showed several coworker my leftovers. I haven't even digested properly before writing this review!

I have such a respect for Mac Mart because like me, the owner and founder is a Drexel University Alumni. It started out with a bright pink food trunk on our campus. I remember it was the only macaroni and cheese truck in Philly. Won a lot of awards. And for good reason! 
I got lunch there once a week my freshman year. And even my sophomore year, when the prices went up to prepare for a store front. 
I was so excited when this place got a building in center city. It's hard to miss with the bright neon pink sign. It's kinda like cold stone. They have original recommended flavors (my go to is In the Buff) or a build your own. It is $10 but it usually lasts two meals for me. It even comes in reusable Tupperware!

The first time  I went I came here to get a breakfast sandwich to see what the hype was about. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with cooper sharp cheese (which I paid extra for) and turkey sausage.   Got my sandwich that was on whole wheat bread and noticed the egg was not fluffy but fried hard.  The cheese was american and not the cooper sharp that I paid extra for.  Its deceptive on the ordering screen they show a sausage patty but give you a link cut in half on the sandwich.  The sandwich is close to $5 dollars and in my opinion you could get a better breakfast sandwich from a food truck or the foodery up the street.  As I was eating it I was thinking to myself I should have gotten a wrap, as I noticed another person ordering a wrap.  So I thought to myself maybe it was my fault I should have ordered a wrap instead of a sandwich.  So, fast forward to today. I decided to give this place another chance and order a wrap this time.  Decided to add a few things to the wrap: mushroom onion and green peppers (extra charge) thinking that it would make a nice fat wrap. I was expecting the wrap to look more like a burrito and not an empanada. I still had faith that it would taste good.  It came cut in half and I  was disappointed to see the egg was not fluffy but fried hard and flat.  The grilled peppers and onion was ok but the mushrooms tasted like they came out of a can.  One plus, there was quite a bit of bacon in the wrap, which seemed like it was thrown in there to make up for the lack of egg in the wrap.  I'm from California where the wraps are called burritos and the breakfast burritos are filled with fluffy eggs potatoes peppers bacon and cheese.  I guess Whole Foods will do until I can make it back to California.

First off, let me say... we were on our way to the White Dog Cafe. On a whim, my bf suggested we try the Centennial.  Recalling that a co-worker of mine ALWAYS brought tasty-looking danishes and muffins to work from Centennial, I wholeheartedly agreed to give it a try.

I ordered the shrimp and grits. I loved it! It was served PIPING HOT with mushrooms, onions, tomatos, and cheese and of course, grits. it reminded me of a cajun dish like shrimp creole or jambalaya.  I wish they served something else with it though, because after a while, you do need something else to break up that taste.   My bf shared his french toast with me, which solved that problem.

All right, it's a steak house and it can be stuffy....and frequented by older clientele.

Forget that! Make the place your own! We do and have a ball!

First. sit at the bar and not a table. Make sure Lynn is bartending! Tell her you want to start with a Brent's Old Fashioned! You're already off to a good start.

The games play on tvs at the bar, the conversation can be lively, and you get all good things without a stuffy feel.

Here's the secret...they do a $35.00 3-course offering all year round. You just have to ask for it. Now, the portions are soo large you can share everything. Mel says the French Onion soup is the best in the city. I usually go for the oysters. I figure, when in Rome...so dinner is usually Prime Rib, which is always perfect. It's at least a 15-ounce cut which means left overs the next day. Mel has had salmon, crab imperial, and other dishes with very good things to say about all of them. I've had potatoes a few different ways and they are always very basic, but always done very well. The veg is always super fresh. Try the corn off the cob. I can't get over how good corn can be in November.

The wine list can be a little pricey so have one glass, but splurge on something nice. You'll be happy you did. 

The desserts are awesome. In fact I have a slice of Key Lime pie in the fridge for dessert tonight.

Their calamari are not fried, but instead served in a red sauce. Haven't had them like this before, and probably won't again. The calamari tasted extremely fishy as I've never known calamari to taste before.

The veal parmigiana was a hearty portion, however the veal marsala was very small and the same price.

The bread that was put on our table was fresh (from the bakery next door), but it was served cold. Not even warm from sitting on top of the oven or something. Poor choice.  The butter was in little individual containers as opposed to a little dish with fresh SOFT butter.

The side of ""greens"" is this mix of spinach, onions, garlic, and other stuff. It was OK tasting, but it was cold when it came out to our table.

The bruscetta was served on toasted bread and the topping was pretty good. Can't complain there.

The desserts, were, well, very good. They make everything there. It was just really good.

The service was good, but a lot of food arrived at our table (party of seven) cold. It was a little bit disheartening considering that they handle large tables of people all the time.

I know other reviews have knocked their lack of black beans, but from the menu I saw, it seems they listen to customer suggestions/complaints which is always nice.
2. It's not a gross chain like Qdoba or Chipotle. Those have their time and place, sure, but now more than ever it's important to support local, independent businesses. The cashier was nice there, and our food arrived quickly, too.
3. Lots of vegetarian options-- I wasn't very hungry, but would love to try their sweet potato burrito or tofu burrito. 

Cons:
1. I shared the plain nachos with my boyfriend, and while he said he really liked them, I just...did not. The chips were a little too greasy and almost limp for me. I like them crispier or thicker. It is nice that they make their own chips, I guess, but I've had better homemade chips at other Mexican joints.

2) The place is BYOB! We happily went through about 6 bottles of wine that night in preparation for Karaoke. Fabulous! 

3) For meat eaters, there's lots of animals to choose from - duck, chicken, beef, squid, abalone, shrimp, pork, clams, lobster, etc...

We met up with my parents and sister, who were in town visiting, and their close friends who were our connection to the Tre Scalini family.

We were immediately seated for our Friday dinner, and as menus were passed around we heard the specials for that evening. Since its BYO, we had brought two bottles of wine with us to enjoy with a traditional, homestyle Italian meal. They offer the option of having the entire table do family-style tastings, choosing several dishes from the antipasti and pastas, and then individuals order entrees, but we decided a party of our size wouldn't be able to decide very easily, so instead my sister, fiance and I shared dishes. We ordered the polenta of the day which had broccoli rabe, the antipasti misto, and a special beet arugula salad to start, and for our entrees we shared the fish of the day, which was branzino with tomatoes and capers, and their pasta nera alla pescareccia (which I couldn't technically eat because I'm allergic to prawns...but that didn't stop me from tasting the stuff around them).

The antipasti are all rather small dishes, but we were just able to split them 3 ways. The beet arugula salad also had orange slices and shaved pecorino, and was a bit heavily dressed with vinaigrette, but tasty. The polenta was grilled so it was both crispy and creamy, and the broccoli rabe was cooked perfectly. The antipasti misto was super small - literally 3 artichoke heart halves - so we each got a small bite that also included sliced prosciutto and burrata. My parents and their friends also shared the arugula salad and antipasti mixto (once they saw our plate, they copied our order :P).

We waited a little bit for our entrees because my father and his friend opted to share the spaghetti aglio ed olio as a mid-course - but no one else ordered a mid-course, so we 'glared' at them to finish up. The branzino was cooked in parchment, so the fillet was nice and tender. Nothing too special, though. The pasta was the better dish, with fresh lump crab meat and large prawns, although the squid ink pappardelle pasta seemed just past the al dente point and was a bit too soft. My mother had their mussels in red sauce antipasti as her entree, which she enjoyed, and her friend had the bistecca di vitello ai tre funghi (her usual favorite dish), and my father and his friend both had the vitello picante (his usual favorite dish). The meat dishes are apparently their specialty, so you should probably try those first.

Crispy flatbread - this is really unlike anything we have had before and didn't really hit home for either of us. I wouldn't order this again, but not to say that others wouldn't like it. Apparently it is one of the most popular menu items
Lamb chops - bf really enjoyed these
Bbq ribs - we both loved these
Crispy fried chicken - soooooooooo good

We also ordered a few specialty cocktails and had the signature rosemary & thyme popcorn which was quite delicious.

The dinner menu is on the pricier side, but if you're not into that I would recommend swinging by for happy hour. Those prices are unbeatable.

Their menu size isn't huge or anything but a good enough variety for you to choose from.  People usually go for brunch, but they also serve lunch and dinner!

The location is weird but whatevs. If you go at the wrong time (early afternoon) the place will be packed and you might have to wait for awhile for someone to get out because the restaurant itself is not big.
Waiters and waitresses take awhile to get to you too along with the wait time for your food. So that could be annoying.

BUT!! Once the food comes in, it'll all make up for it hahahha. I've had the Huevos Rancheros twice because I love my crispy tortillas!!!! But I might stop because I actually like Cafe Lift's Huevos Rancheros better.... SORRY!

Because I now have a Sabrina's in my neighborhood, why would I go anywhere else, right? Wrong. Oh so, so wrong. I am now a convert to the Church of Honey's Sit-N-Eat because, with the exception of perhaps my grandmother's bacon and eggs, I had the best breakfast of my life there on Saturday. What is served at Honey's is beyond comfort food, it is mother food. 

Upon walking in to put our name on the list, the smell was intoxicating. The restaurant is small, warm and homey. The wait for 4 was 45 minutes, so we went to get some tea down the street. 

We were offered coffee even before we were seated, pretty sweet. I meant to try the grapefruit juice, it is too hard to find fresh squeezed juice these days. I had the omelet with brisket, cheddar, tomato and caramelized onions, plus a latke and a biscuit. My boyfriend had the chicken-fried steak, which was great. My yankee stomach had never experienced this dish or white gravy. I was a bit wary, but it was so tender and not too greasy. I'm still not totally sold on white gravy, I really think it just isn't my thing. 

Over all, everything was amazing, but the biscuit was my favorite part. I can't make biscuits for the life of me, they always end up like hockey pucks. But Honey's are tender, flaky and delicious. I could probably eat an entire pile of them, especially with the (obviously homemade) jam on the table.

I was surprised I didn't feel greasy after I left, like I do after most heavy brunches. But I did only manage to eat half my meal and had the rest for dinner. At home, I had to be on the defense against my boyfriend and our two cats, all vying for what was left of the biscuit.

What is not to love here? I've tried everything on their menu and they're all sooooo good! 

+Thai short rib or chicken satay taco ($3 a piece): great flavors, not too heavy, avocados aplenty, and delicious spicy mayo sauce
+Chicken Katsu ($5 + 50cents for egg): substantially-sized, crunchy chicken strips with rice, tomato chunks, and sesame seeds in tonkatsu sauce 
+Red veggie curry ($5): potato and pumpkin chunks with rice in a creamy curry broth, DELICIOUS. Spice level is perfect.
+Cap'n Crunch encrusted tilapia burrito($6): slightly sweet, crunchy, and flavorful; generously portioned. Don't miss out on this one!
+Mexican veggie burger ($4): I'm not a vegetarian but I really wouldn't miss meat if I could eat this daily. Love the spicy mayo!
+Thai ice tea/thai green tea ($2): refreshing, not too sweet, waaay better than starbucks

Owners are super gracious and friendly. They really care about their customers since they make an effort to engage in conversation with you.

Only downsides:
-Some of their menu choices take a long time like the Tilapia, especially during the lunch rush (~15 minute wait) but totally worth it
-Random closings. I've been here a couple of times only to find them closed. A few weeks ago, I dragged my friend after class to try my favorite food truck.

After going3 for happy hour, drinks, and dinner multiple times I decided to have my birthday here. The staff made it a wonderful night.

Our waitress, Lyndsie was very attentive and made us feel at home. 

While the drinks here are phenomenal, the real treat is the food. No trip to Southgate is complete without indulging in the Korean Fried Chicken, the double fried, crispy perfection topped off with either a soy garlic (my favorite) or spicy gochujang sauce. The chicken katsu is another favorite of mine. This tender, breaded chicken is topped with a Korean bbq type sauce served with a side of rice and a little cabbage salad. I love this dish for the variety of flavor and the portion is huge!

I tried the bibimbap for the first time during my birthday dinner, choosing the hot stone pot option which I highly recommend!  While the presentation of this dish is marvelous, its encouraged that you mix it up before eating. The contents of your bowl continue to cook while you eat and the rice gets nice and crispy.

Growing up near Philly, we have admired the building from afar. As we rode the private elevator to the 137th floor, our expectations were high - and the staff didn't let us down! 

The Valentines Dinner was a set menu. The servers asked that we order our appetizer, entree, and dessert at the same time. With so many guests for the holiday, it was a wise decision for the evening. It was difficult to choose because everything sounded so delicious. Where else can you get shrimp cocktail AND lobster for your appetizer? I could have ate just that and been satisfied. The courses came out in a timely fashion, everything was the right temperature and cooked exactly how we asked. My husband had the veal and I had the steak. We caught each other chewing with our eyes closed and a big smile after every delicious bite to fully enjoy every moment. 

During our meal, we received a complimentary appetizer and dessert. This was way more than expected and I was especially excited because I had trouble choosing between two desserts. The free dessert was actually my second choice, which I happily devoured as well. The Assistant General Manager, Brittney, approached our table and asked about our experience. With full bellies and smiles from ear to ear, we could not stop talking about how amazing the food and service was. But there was one problem - we wanted to get a photo of us with the beautiful Philadelphia skyline below, but we did not want to interrupt other customers dinners. When we mentioned this to Brittney, she personally took us to a private room so that we could get our picture taken. Just like how everything else in the restaurant was above and beyond, Brittney took the time to take several photos with and without flash, horizontal and vertical, just to make sure we were happy. I must say, we are more than happy! We were treated like we were the only guests in the restaurant and we are already talking about coming back for happy hour ASAP! 

FYI if you are considering reservations for  next year - The reservation process for Valentines Dinner was different than I have experienced. When we called in December, we were put on a list of callbacks for when they opened the books   for 2/14 in January. When we were called back, we were asked to make a $50 deposit to reserve a table (which went to our total bill at the end). That is totally understandable considering the type of place and popularity of the night! 

Also there is a full-size mirror in the restrooms so that you can snap a selfie in your fancy attire. If I could give this restaurant 10 stars, I would. You'll feel like a celebrity as soon as you walk off the elevator.",2017-02-20 22:41:38,"{'food': ['shrimp cocktail', 'lobster'], 'drink': []}"

Bruchetta was probably the highlight of the meal. The proscuitto was average quality at best. The ""salad"" with it was a ball of mixed greens with dressing? Really? 

The pasta with a porcini sauce, was really an incredibly rich white sauce with porcini mushrooms (which in total, probably was a single cap, very skimpy).

The only problem is that the Mahi Mahi was piping hot, but my carne and carnitas were cold. I figure this is because it might take longer to make the fried fish tacos, but if that's the case, they shouldn't make them all at the same time. They should start the fish, wait, and then cook the meats. 

I also noticed there was less meat and more toppings on the carne and carnitas than the other times I've been here. This could be because those times it was dead, and this time it was sort of crowded (10 or so customers already eating, then another 5-10 came in after I ordered).

My go-to is the sandwich counter.  I had consulted Yelp before I ever walked in and decided there was no way a ""half"" sandwich would suffice for my lunch despite what was said in several reviews.. and I was wrong.  First, and foremost, the half sandwiches are just smaller portions of full sandwiches, not actually half a sandwich.  For example, if you order a whole egg salad sandwich, you're going to have a 4"" tall egg salad sandwich on your hands, whereas a half egg salad sandwhich is a more managable 2-3"" tall.  I eat a lot, and the half sandwich is plenty.  The sandwiches also come with a side.  I recommend the spicy potato salad personally, but all their side salads are pretty good, and you can also get a piece of fruit or chips.  

The interesting assortment of brownies and cake slices strategically placed at the cash registers are quite tasty and usually won't dissapoint.

Unfortunately, for this tried and true southerner, the tea was made from a mix and not freshly brewed. While I was more than a bit skeptical that sweet tea could be found north of South Carolina, the burgers did not disappoint, which is entirely the point of 500 Degrees. 

These are serious burgers. You can choose your meat, including Kobe (!), your favorite cheese (pepper jack anyone?), and even an assortment of other toppings and craft sauces. Throw in a milkshake and you'd think you've been transported to a 50's burger shack. 

The ambiance is not like a 50's burger joint though. It is a minimalistic with wood, concrete, large scale Italian tile and reclaimed wood tables. It has the Chipotle aesthetic, which is perfect for these upscale burgers. Add to this, it is located on Samson street where you will not be accosted by homeless people looking for your spare change. At least, not yet.

Back to the burgers. They are juicy, thickly formed and perfectly cooked (to your specification of doneness no less), on a brioche bun. I'd seriously consider eating these with both hands in a death grip to prevent someone from stealing my burger, but I wanted to keep the juices flowing down one hand instead of two. 

My only beef, (sorry had to go there), was with the fries. These were shoestring natural cut and crisp, but many were no longer than 1"" to 2"". Normally size does not matter to this gal, but when talking french fries, you can't do much with a skimpy fry when dipping them in the delicious sauces 500 degrees has to offer.

My friend was visiting Philadelphia for the first time, so I made reservations at Sbraga for the night she arrived. We're Top Chef fans, we were interested in the prix fixe concept, $49 for 4 courses, and thought the menu sounded good.

Oh boy were we wrong.

We started with the foie gras soup, which tasted oddly of curry and while good and creamy really lacked the richness of foie. The presentation was impressive and quite beautiful, but the course itself was lacking. Another friend had the salmon with frozen yogurt, which when presented was nothing like we expected, but she said it was good. 

Second course - I had the bronzino and my friends had the scallop and pork belly. The fish was okay, though some portions were extremely salty. The scallop and pork belly were well cooked, but came with extra cubes of watermelon that nobody understood how to eat. Was it supposed to be eaten with the scallops? The pork belly? I can understand that the freshness of the fruit may help cut some of the fattiness of the pork belly, but they were unnecessary and something better could have been substituted. 

Third course - I had the meat loaf (much to my friends' surprise). I have never had meat loaf before and I have to say.. it was good. The loaf is a combination of pork, veal, and some foie gras with a bacon marmalade. It had a heavy bacon flavor, but who doesn't like that? The texture and the flavor of the meat loaf itself was so good and I didn't regret my decision at all. Neither of my dining companions enjoyed the pork tenderloin; apparently it was over cooked, and though I'm not a tenderloin fan even I could see that it looked dry. 

For dessert we had the strawberry and rhubarb crumble, and the chocolate tart with pistachio ice cream. Both were fine but nothing stood out. The chocolate tart was incredibly rich and the crust was nothing to write home about. I ended up just scraping the chocolate off the tart crust. The pistachio ice cream was a complete fail. It tasted more like almond (has anyone had Chinese almond jello?) and was much too icy to be considered ice cream. Disappointing.

We ended up paying $75 each after tax and tip for a four course meal and one cocktail a piece. While paying I felt incredibly ripped off - there's no way the meal was worth that kind of money. Look, I'm willing to pay a good amount of money for a good meal, but Sbraga was not it. Double whammy  was when I checked my credit card bill and saw the charge and thought, ""wtf? When did I go to Sbraga?"" The meal was THAT forgettable. 

OH and I have to mention the weird service. We had this waiter who was completely awkward. He would show up out of nowhere and overstay his welcome at the table, just kind of.. hanging out. When he came to get our dessert order, I said I needed a minute, so he just stood there. And waited. Um, awkward much? The other waiter we had a brief interaction with was great and so friendly and helpful, but the actual waiter we had was strange and almost made the experience at Sbraga a little worse than it already was.",2012-07-26 02:43:49,"{'food': ['meat loaf', 'foie gras soup', 'bronzino'], 'drink': ['chocolate tart with pistachio ice cream']}"

I was having a hard time ordering because there were so many good entrees to choose from. I ordered the Bruschetta Tilapia because I love bruschetta. Every bite was phenomenal.

I had asked for no cucumber in my sushi, yet there was still cucumber in my sushi. Me & my sister had ordered the kani salad, 2 miso soups, the lobster/avocado roll, a philadelphia roll, & the spicy crab roll. The kani salad was amazing! It was so good. I would go back just for the kani salad. Sushi was standard, so was the miso soup. I had expected more from the spicy crab roll, but it was just the imitation crab wrapped in seaweed, no spice at all. I had also ordered the tamago sushi but never received it. When the bill came, lo & behold there was the tamago sushi still on the bill. I had to walk to the back of the restaurant, where all of the employees were chilling & eating at a table. Our water was not refilled until the check came, nor were we checked on. They were happy to take the tamago off the bill, but offered no apologies.

After receiving a crazy good review in Philadelphia Magazine and being mentioned in NYT, I thought for sure I would walk out after dinner here thinking it was one of the best meals, ever. Um...no. And the amazing service everyone spoke of in previous reviews, where was it?

I made reservations over 4 weeks ago and the only time I could get on a Friday night was 9:00pm. Ok, no problem, I understand they are super popular. So be warned unless you get lucky, it's really tough to get a good time on a weekend. I thought service was slow and poor in quality. Two examples - I finished the appetizer I shared with my friend and 10 minutes later asked if my server could clear my plate. She responded....""in a minute."" The restaurant wasn't crowded, she didn't have anything in her hands and quite frankly, it's not a lot to ask for my plate to be taken away 10 minutes after I finish eating. Also my water glass was left empty twice. Once I can understand, but twice is just not acceptable. 

The food was good but not amazing. I took previous reviewers' suggestions and ordered the beet steak (burnt on the bottom) and the striped bass. The best dish was the squid ink spaghettoni...definitely one to order.

My friend and I split 2 appetizers and 1 entree and we walked out pretty full. We both agreed $35/each for the experience was ok but if we would have spent $70/each, it would have been way overpriced for the value.  I don't see myself going back to this restaurant which is crazy because I'm fiercely loyal if I have a good experience. Based on this experience (and them forgetting I asked to celebrate my friend's birthday too), I'm sad to say it's doubtful I will return.",2013-03-23 05:00:10,"{'food': ['beet steak', 'striped bass', 'squid ink spaghettoni'], 'drink': []}"

HipCityVeg was the closest business of food to Le Meridien per Yelp! of my preference. (Thanks Yelp!) We tried to go before The Roots Festival however, the line was a bit long and we were on a time crunch.

Sunday, waking up early to make sure we had time to have this experience, my partner and I had lunch this time. A window seat, for the two of us to chow down.

A small setting, but in your face delectable options! We chose the chicken sandwich and the taco salad, with NO disappointments! Okay, there was a slight disappoint. The chicken could have been more crispy as we were given the option. Beware HipCityVeg, NuVegan has some CRISPY CHICKEN to compete with!

Seeing as I'm not usually around home often enough to go and try new place, I decided to stop by one day while in the city. As it's a little out of the city, it might be a little more out of the way for most but as appropriate, there's also not as many people around (think less busy and more parking available, timed but free in this area). While the place has its preset options under ""House Favorites"", which you can certainly order if you're too lazy to make your own, I personally found the latter to be the more intriguing option (personal opinion only). If you build your own, it comes in small (3 scoops of protein) or large (5 scoops of protein). You can also add your proteins (i.e. salmon, tuna, shrimp, octopus, albacore, crab is $1 extra), along with seasonings (Hawaiian salt, sesame seeds, furikake, chili flakes), various toppings (many available to your liking, avocado is $1 extra), and sauces. Drinks to choose from include water ($2), tea, coconut water ($3), and soda ($2.50). I made my own bowl and knew that once I had my first bite that I was pretty sold. Ingredients here are pretty fresh, which anybody can just about appreciate. Vast selection of meats, sauces, toppings mean you can customize to your heart's content, liking, or particular tastes.

Well, my second visit did not go well. Since it took so bloody long to get my pizza last time, I ordered ahead on Grub Hub at 12:15pm. I arrived at 12:35 and they hadn't even STARTED MAKING IT YET! I stood their and waited forever (like last time) for service. When I was acknowledged, the girl said ""Oh yea!"" and grabbed my order that had printed and handed it to the cook. Awesome. 

Now, I also ordered something slightly different. I ordered their three cheese pizza on Foccacia (they also offer gluten free.)  This was my way of trying to write a well-rounded review AND possibly avoid burnt crust again. Did they remember to make my pizza on Foccacia? Of course not. 

The pizza wasn't that bad in the end except that they burnt the crust AGAIN. But, the overall experience was bad.

We'd made reservations, but when I arrived, the hostess was rude and almost made it feel like I was inconveniencing her by asking to be seated. I'm pretty tolertant, having been in the business a while, but man, she was just plain rude. Strike one.

They had us in a sort of private room, which was nice, but holy cow, it had to be about 90º in there. It was incredibly uncomfortable, but not a huge problem.

I don't remember any of us having expressed dissatisfaction with the wait or the service at that point, so not sure why she felt the need to remind us they were busy.

We had three ladies, rude hostess included, waiting on our party, and we admittedly weren't an easy party to handle with folks coming and going as the race was ending.

Plan a self-guided gastronomic adventure through one of the greatest, food-loving cities in all the land. This year, my fiancé and I decided to hit as many hotspots as possible by spreading our feast out over two days. In order to do so, we booked a night stay at the Loews Hotel. 

I chose the hotel because of its convenient location. I booked a somewhat reasonably-priced package which included parking-that deserves at least a star. Due to a website glitch, I had to call to book my reservation. After I hung up, I realized I never asked about our check-in time. Unfortunately, I found out it wasn't until 4:00PM! That is the latest, lamest check-in I've ever heard of. Subtract aforementioned star. We arrive early and ask them to hold our bags while we go out to get some grub. The receptionist tells me we can stay in a lesser (price/quality) room now or wait for the room we paid for/deserve. Um, we'll wait. She assures us she'll call when the room is ready. We stay relatively close by anticipating a call. No call. Thankfully, the room was ready upon our return. It was on a high floor (the concierge level). Yay! Loved the views. It seemed clean, and looked modern. Star added. Well, hold on a second. While it's true for the majority of the space, the bathroom had some maintenance issues. The sink had a huge crack in it, and the several lights were out. Disappointing.

Since our package included free drinks at their restaurant, we stopped at Bank & Bourbon on our way out for the evening. Great bar, friendly bartender, excellent cocktails. 

Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The one aspect I'd be remiss not to mention is their fantastic customer service. As a native of the City of Brotherly Love, I can admit that it's not always the friendliest place to be. The staff here polishes our tarnished reputation (sports fan, you hear me?). They were all genuinely nice. That was much appreciated!! Yep. Another star added...

As others will surely tell you, do not expect anything similar to Japanese ramen. As my boyfriend and I are Japanese, it was very difficult for us to divorce the idea of a bowl of noodles from ramen, so perhaps this was the reason I cannot give Cheu a perfect rating. However, it's definitely an adventurous time.

We ordered the beef dumplings, Brisket noodles, and the Spicy Shrimp Broth noodles. The dumplings had a wonderful gingery bite and the chili oil was not too strong. However, I would remove the fried quinoa if I could as they tended to get stuck in your teeth and linger in your mouth far longer than the enjoyment of the dumpling.

The soup of the brisket noodles had strong hints of Korean cuisine and was flavored similarly to the sour and spicy taste of kimchi. The brisket was perfectly soft and I was surprised at how well the matzo ball worked with the broth.

The spicy shrimp broth noodles were a bit of a let down as the hero of the dish, the fried shrimp balls were minuscule and did not add too much to the experience. The broth was clearer, light, and had a lot of Vietnamese notes. The combination of raw onions, bean sprouts, and shrimp balls was not a home-run for me.

No one wanted to finish the first few slices of the chocolate cheese cake I brought.  I thought my sister was on a diet or something when she only took one bite.  Eventually my family's polite mode wore off (a record 3 minutes) and they were pretty liberal with their critique of the cake.

After a twenty minute wait, we were called in and sat at a two-top table, admiring the cozy, shady, woody interior that again made me think of my old home out west. We quickly scoured the menu, which contained approximately 0 bad-sounding items, and put in an order for eggs benedict (for my lovely lady friend) and something called ""enfrijoladas"" with chorizo for me.

The food was out quickly, and it tasted like dynamite. My dish was essentially egg and sausage and various other delicious Mexican food fillings, inside enchiladas amid a slurry of black beans and adorned with a micro salad. It was extremely delicious, and so was my lady's food... but sadly, the whole experience was over far too quickly. I downed my plate with ease, every bite, and had some room to spare.

It aims to distinguish itself from other burger joints by using very fresh ingredients and serving up many different unusual burgers.  This is not an order-at-the-counter but a sit-down waiter-service operation.   Bareburger is hitting some good notes.  The Elk Burger I had was most excellent - topped as it were with Amish Blue Cheese, bacon & onions, and fig jam.  The elk meat itself was extremely tasty.  However the side I ordered had to be one of the most disappointing sides I've gotten recently in Philadelphia or anywhere.  It was a wasabi carrot slaw that sounded so good and tasted so bland.  It was also mushy - probably from sitting around a little too long ... and I couldn't even definitively taste the wasabi.  The portion was very small and yet it cost $3.85.  The mark-up and profit on this side dish must be huge.  So why mention this disappointing side when the obvious main attraction is the burger and that was excellent?  Well with all the burger joints that continue to head Philadelphia's way, it is going to be the little things that differentiate the various franchises....probably even more that the burgers themselves.  

The atmosphere with lots of woodwork kinda def fits in with the cuisine.  Service was fine ... although I was never asked how things were after the food was served.  And the bill with tax and tip for this rather small-in-size lunch without ordering any beverage came to twenty dollars.

Why is it freaking awesome?  It has a casual atmosphere, great food, great beer options, and (at least from my visit) great service.  And they serve a pretty rockin version of my favorite food- mac n cheese.  And it is in the family of my two other favorites in the city- Cantina and Royal Tavern.

We visited for Philly Beer Week early on a Friday evening.  They had a happy hour going on, so I was able to get a draft for pretty cheap.  Speaking of their beers, they have an amazing selection of beers, including Abita, which is one of my favorite breweries.

For food, I was extremely pumped about the cajun menu with a vegan/veg twist.  My husband and I ordered some fried green tomatoes and a muffaletta sandwich with a side of mac n cheese to share.  The fried green tomatoes were awesome although I wished they had given some more of the yummy remoulade sauce on the side.  I love muffalettas (it's a sandwich made of a variety of meats, melted swiss cheese and topped with an olive salad) and this one.  Plus it's HUGE and for the price ($10), its a great deal.  And the mac n cheese... this stuff is slap-yo-mama good.  OMG.

Now onto the service.  Well... we asked to have the muffaletta on two plates since we were sharing.  When our meal came out, I noticed that they split the sandwich but also gave us EACH an entire serving of the mac n cheese!  Score!

Strawberry Shortcake -- At first smell, you get a strong sense of strawberry jam from the icing glaze. Much of its strawberry taste comes from the glaze, though the bread itself also holds a lighter taste of strawberries.

Grapefruit Brulee -- Of the three, this one had the strongest taste. The glaze was immensely tarty (enough so that we both made sour faces within a few seconds of chewing). However, that initial tartiness soon dissipates within ~ 10 seconds. 

Lemon Ricotta -- This one was by far my favorite. The taste was very light and sweet (ironic since one would associate lemon with being more of a tart taste). The donut batter was not as cake-like as the others, which complimented its delicate taste. 

At the end of the day, however, these donuts are very pricey -- $2.50 for each of their specialty ones ($1.50 for the regulars). For such specialty flavored donuts, you could also look at Beiler's (in Reading Terminal Market) -- they're individual donuts are less than $1.00 and they have more of a variety to choose from!",2015-07-19 03:08:02,"{'food': ['Strawberry Shortcake', 'Grapefruit Brulee', 'Lemon Ricotta'], 'drink': []}"

So once we were seated the fun began. They explained to our group how it worked and took our order. It's a byob so they opened out wine but also brought over some of their white wine. Like I said this was all a new experience as I've never had Moroccan food, so eating off the same plate and with just your hands took a little getting used to but it was fun. They wash your hands with rose oil water first, which smells amazing, but I also had my sanitizer. They also come around with a big basket of pita bread which kind of serves as your silverware.

I came here with a few friends in the afternoon after shopping at the Brooklyn Flea Market. We were seated instantly (since we arrived at an awkward hour). I didn't think the menu appeared to be that inventive compared to some of the other brunch places in Philly, perhaps because I'm more partial to two kinds of brunch options--sweet and fruity or Mexican--and the menu seemed sparse on both.

Most of the options were pretty standard fare--my friends ordered a biscuit and eggs, an omelette, and a pancake wrapped around eggs and bacon. I decided on huevos rancheros but was unpleasantly surprised when I learned that it did not come with guacamole and in fact that adding guacamole would cost $4. Even more ridiculous than Chipotle. I was briefly indignant about this injustice, but my displeasure was short-lived once my entree arrived.

The huevos rancheros had nice and crispy tortilla chips in the center, topped with black beans, rice, shredded pepper jack cheese, a fried egg, and a large roasted red pepper on top. Surrounding this centerpiece were small piles of jalapeno peppers, sour cream, and a salad of julienned lettuce, tomatos, and onions. All the ingredients tasted fresh and light, and the runny yolk really tied the whole dish together and made me forget about the lack of guacamole (cost-effective strategy on their part, huh?)

After finally squeaking through the door last night just before 8 pm, I can now say I agree with its good reputation! It is truly a gem in the neighborhood. I love that it is BYOB. At ~6.50 a plate, Sky Cafe boasts street food prices, but the dining area is nicer than I expected given the cheap prices: it's clean, comfortable, and well-decorated. Although my friend had to take my order over the phone at 7:45 as I rushed there before closing, the waiter was patient and excellent at recommending a vegetarian dish I would enjoy. He was very helpful and polite and he never made us feel rushed.

Now, on to the food. Everything was fresh and arrived speedily to the table. My friends both got the Mie Kepiting (homemade egg noodles with crab meat). The noodles were phenomenal; a delightful and unique combination of texture and flavor. The noodles and crab meat are in one bowl, and the broth is served on the side, so you can pour it in to suit your ideal ratio of noodles: broth. I got the Nasi Urap with what were described to me as ""stinky beans"" (I did not find them very stinky at all, which is a good thing). The beans came in a rich, spicy, coconutty sauce that I absolutely adored. The plate came with a nest of assorted crispy fried vegetables, which complimented the texture of the beans and rice perfectly. I was a little disappointed there were not more vegetarian items on the menu, considering the many vegan options available at other Indonesian restaurants in the area, but apparently they can make several dishes to order, so I would love to come back and try a vegetarian version of the noodles if they have it.

The cafe itself is sleek and cool - you see less laptops here and more newspapers, which is a nice change of pace.  Conveniently located near Rittenhouse, they are in the perfect spot for tourists and businessmen alike.

That aside, I moonlight as a barista from time to time, and I personally think the beans are nothing to write home about.  Quality has definitely gone down over the past few years, likely due to higher quantities of beans being roasted.  I find that the brewed coffee leaves a bitter, dry taste in my mouth - not unlike Starbucks.  The espresso is better, but still not as great as I would have expected.  I'd agree with a previous reviewer as to the beans being roasted way too dark.  In fact, the key to LC's success has probably been locally producing a product that's still better, but not much more, than Starbucks.

Mu Shu Pork with brandy hoison sauce.  Very good (I'm a sucker for those scallion pancakes), not anything you couldn't get up in china town but they don't even pretend and label it as Classic.

Endless chips and salsa, plus side o' guacamole, came out fast and were joined by a couple of fine craft brews (small but good selection). The guac, pico de gallo and salsa verde were all good, and they rub a bit of spice on the chips for extra kick, which was a nice touch. Is there a better app for $4 within a 3-mile radius? Probably not, but you tell me.

As others have noted, the burritos aren't what many of us are used to.

Excellent service throughout: attentive but not rushed. I don't know how some people got duped or upsold on the $5 rice and beans side.

I had made a reservation, which turned out to be a good idea because they were pretty busy. In the reservation, we had asked for an outdoor table. The hostess had reserved us an indoor table. We told her that we were willing to wait for an outdoor table to give the server some time, if he had been seated recently. While the hostess was reluctantly figuring out whether to give us an outdoor table, an older lady (maybe a manager?) came over and took us to an outdoor table. 

Our server was reasonably good. He frequently checked in on us. However, our water glasses remained empty for long stretches of time. When we were ready to order, the older lady who seated us came to take our order instead of our server. 

We ordered 3 items for starters: the Dan Dan noodles, Crispy Rice Style Pork, and the Bok Choy vegetable dish, to which the older lady said, ""THAT'S IT?!?!"" followed by, ""THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO ORDER???""  all in a very rude tone and incredulous facial expression. I almost choked. 

As someone with many years in the restaurant industry, I understand  why one would prefer dining guests to order more. However, I did emphasize that we wanted to order those items as starters. Most restaurants don't have a problem with this. Also, even if I ever thought that a guest ordered too little, (I might secretly curse them out in my head, but) I would NEVER say it to the guest. 

Also, as many reviewers point out, the portions are fairly large. I'm not  a hugely large eater and I don't think it's wrong to order a comfortable amount of food when dining at a restaurant. (We were still very full by the time we left.) The way the older lady reacted when taking our order was tacky and unprofessional, but the real disappointment was that it took over an hour for our orders to arrive (last time, it took only 10 min). It seemed like she ""forgot"" to give the kitchen our order... maybe because she thought we didn't order enough. 

After 45 minutes, we asked our server about our food. He promptly went to the kitchen and came back saying the food was on its way. 15 minutes later, we asked him again. He checked with the kitchen and said that they had run out of bowls. At the same time, a table of 3 just got seated near us. About 10 minutes later, that table of 3 received an order of Dan Dan noodles (in a bowl!) despite the kitchen's alleged lack of bowls. We still did not receive any of our items... not even the boiled vegetable side dish, which takes about 5 minutes to make. 

A few minutes later, a manager came out with yet another bowl of Dan Dan noodles, but he offered it to a couple who said they didn't order it. The bowl was sent back to the kitchen, though I suspected that it had been ours. I thought about lunging for it, but it disappeared before I could even blink. Another few minutes later, I talked to a girl who was checking on tables and got her to finally bring out our dishes. She apologized that our food ""took so long to arrive"" ... meaning 1.5 hrs in this case. My friends were really hungry (that's how they kept track of the exact time). I felt so badly about telling them how good Han Dynasty was. 

This experience really deserves 1 star, but I'm giving 2 stars after taking my last visit into account. I believe the bad reviews a bit more now. I'm not sure if I can still recommend this place at the risk of having others wait 1.5hrs for their food and get rude service from that older lady (the hostess/manager/person who took down our order). We didn't ask for a discount, but if this happens to you, make sure you get yours.",2012-09-12 15:21:14,"{'food': ['Dan Dan noodles', 'Crispy Rice Style Pork', 'Bok Choy vegetable dish'], 'drink': []}"

I'm a burger snob when it comes to take-out burgers with most not meeting my satisfactory standard (sorry mcdonald's you are so below me) but 500 degrees gives you that steak house quality burger while meeting the American instant gratification need.

I ordered The 500 and wow, devoured it in under 5 minutes.  All the burgers here are good and their fries? Forget about it--amazing!  They're cooked in truffle oil to give it that extra kick.  Ask for their house sauce free of charge and it makes a great dipping sauce.

Appetizers
Potato and Herb Gnocchi -- This was absolutely delicious. The little salad that came with it was fantastic and added an excellent crunch to the dish. The broth was so good that I used the bread (also wonderful, by the way) to mop it all up. 

Lobster and Shrimp -- The shrimp were, and I quote, ""amazing"". Cooked extremely well and the cocktail sauce was exceptional. My boyfriend enjoyed the contrast between the warm shrimp and cold lobster, and it was paired very well with the avocado. 

Main Courses
Both of us got the Butcher's Filet of Beef. It was good, especially the Bearnaise sauce, but both of our dishes had temperature issues. I prefer my meat extremely rare, nearly a Pittsburgh blue, and made sure to tell our waiter this. Jon prefers his a little more cooked, though still pink in the middle -- a balance, perhaps, between medium and medium rare. Both of our dishes were overcooked. The manager was extremely apologetic and immediately fired new dishes, but a restaurant of this caliber should not have issues cooking meat to order. Aside from that, the steak fries were awesome. Not too bland on the inside, a danger with a lot of steak fries, but rather deliciously spiced and aired nicely with the short rib gravy. 

Desserts
Warm Vanilla Cake -- Jon ordered this, and I wish I'd had more of an opportunity to steal from him! Unfortunately (for me), he ate it at record speed. He does not typically enjoy desserts, but this was a clear exception. The bite I did have tasted like melted sugar cookies and was reminiscent of my childhood. We both adored it. 

Peruvain Chocolate Mousse -- This was my dessert. It was.. ok. Not memorable. I was shocked that it was a cold preparation because, honestly, it was more like chocolate ice cream. I wouldn't order it again, especially when that warm vanilla cake is available.

Wine
We got a bottle of the Arbios Cabernet, which was fantastic. On the pricey side, but it was well balanced and paired nicely with everything. Not too dry, sometimes a downfall of Cabernet, but still had the characteristic boldness we like so much. 

Overall
Really great experience. The views are lovely, and we were lucky to see it at sunset. Food was also delicious, save for a few slip ups. I'd come back.",2016-02-14 05:02:24,

Although Square 1682 was a pleasant restaurant week experience on the whole and delivered on atmosphere with its warm lighting, cork ceilings and modern earth toned wood fixtures. The chinks in that well polished armor Square 1682 sports became apparent as the evening wore on. Lets begin where the meal ended, shall we?
 
No one likes to have the last impression of a restaurant to be poor. Sadly, this was exactly the case at Square 1682. Nearly every dessert on the restaurant week pre-fixed menu fell short in some small way. Be it ice crystals in the gelato, a pet-peeve of one of my dining associates, to the Caffe con Leche Panna Cotta with steamed milk and an almond-cinnamon biscotti  which was an improvement in the desert spectrum yet carried with it its own fallacies, namely a muted flavor; but this may have been due to the fact that I was drinking a very respectable cappuccino with a mocha flavored dessert. The Apple Cider Fritters with madagascar vanilla bean ice cream and apple cider caramel won out as the best confection in my book. Though deemed too sweet by some in my party, which was true, I found them a perfect with my aforementioned cappuccino. The cinnamon and sugar married well with apple - a welcome update to a classic. Also, an honorable mention should be made to the great biscotti served along side Panna Cotta, they were crisp and yet not in the least stale - a grand accompaniment for the  cappuccino as well. 

As for the main course, well - all I can attest to is that the fish and chips were a grandiose disappointment. Toro was used in place of chips, which only added to the surprising lacking favor. If it were not for the dipping sauces the dish would have had no flavor what-so-ever. I will admit that the dish was not in the least greasy nor was the fish over cooked. It was simply a blank canvas when it came to the flavor profile of the dish as a whole. My dining companions had good things to say about the goat chili and bad things to day about the Lobster Paella but as I did not partake I will refrain from judging.

Finally, there was the creme de la creme of the meal - the appetizer, particularly, the rock octopus with thinly sliced artichoke in a lemon olive oil dressing. This was without a doubt the best part of the meal. The flavors of the dish were harmonious and the texture of the octopus was done just right - resilient but not tough. In fact, I would  be on the merit on this dish alone that I would return to Square 1682.
So, if you find yourself one night sitting in 1682 wondering how to start your meal - heed my advice and get the octopus, then consider getting a drink and hitting the road.",2011-02-23 18:25:36,"{'food': ['Apple Cider Fritters', 'Panna Cotta'], 'drink': ['Cappuccino']}"

I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time, but always heard it was difficult to find so I usually opted for places I knew better, but the RW menu looked great, so I walked over and got there early -- just in case!

So the place is a bit of a schlepp, but it is certainly doable, and eminently worthwhile. It is inside the Marketplace Design Center on 24th and Market. There's lots of nearby parking, and after you get inside the building there are signs every so often to help you get to the restaurant. Go to the elevators near the southwestern area of the building, go up to the 4th floor and then head south again. All the while you're walking you're passing different design stores -- kitchen, bath, rugs, lamps, etc. That's fun, if distracting. I should have left even earlier!  A small corridor opens on to a lovely room with windows along the Schuykill River. I was there in the daytime and it was grand, but I'll bet it's amazing at night.

There is a good selection of wine and beer. I had the frisee salad with lardons and poached egg, and it was delicious. Next was chicken breast with mushroom risotto.

And for good reason. This guy is not messing around. Juicy, tender chicken on a bed of fresh greens, macaroni salad, sliced apples and topped with a few pieces of crispy fried falafel. 
To.
Die.
For. 

Oh and the man behind it all--a riot.  From his fully adorned food cart lined with garlic cloves and hanging plants, the blaring traditional Greek music, and the constant reminder that ""you eat this food, you'll never get sick"" --what a character.

On a four-day jaunt in Philly, the Mrs. and I made it a point to visit this much raved about eatery -- either for a BBQ dinner or a country-style, stick-to-your-ribs breakfast. We opted for the latter and were not disappointed. My three year old wolfed down his plate of pancakes and side of bacon while staring at the well-worn wood decor while his mom slathered that wonderful housemade jam on her corn biscuits. I tackled a monstrous country-fried steak (I had expected a batter-dipped hamburger patty, but got a genuine strip of beer instead) and perfectly cooked eggs with a side of latkes (with both sour cream and apple sauce). While I am not a fan of huge portions, I do very much dig variety and amongst the three of us, we were able to sample enough breakfast fare to comprise a modest hotel breakfast buffet -- only fresher as the pancake was fluffy, the bacon was thick-cut and not chewy, the egg yolks cooked through but oozing, the country-fried steak crisp under warm milk gravy and the biscuits delivered the way I like them (split, grilled and a pat of butter melting on both sides). The latke was certainly non-traditional and that could not have pleased me more. It reminded me of the wonderful deep-fried potato pancakes at the long-gone Deli Haus in Kenmore Square, Boston --- thick, dark patties with a crunchy crust on the outside. I admit that my country gravy required a hefty dose of hot sauce (and Honey's gets thumbs up for doing a superior job of stocking their condiment tray with everything from Tabasco to Sriracha) to overcome a lack of seasoning, but overall, I had no complaints about my meal. 

Perhaps better than the meal was the service and ambience. I had read about the wait and knew how Northern Liberties could be hipster hell so I was prepared. I was fine with waiting as I believe any great eatery should command a wait -- so long as food and service do it justice. As for hipsters and their respective ""too-cool-for-you"" attitude, I got nothing of the sort. Strolling up to the door, I was greeted by the tattooed host, who was walking out to seat another party, with a polite ""Let me seat these guys and I'll be back with you."" We had all of a one minute wait which gave us enough time to scan the dining room and take in the worn wood floors, wood bar and all around charm of a casual, down home cafe. Good soul music was pumping and there was a terrific mix of people from Rittenhouse folks who were slumming it north of Spring Garden to the collegiate crowd... and of course, hipsters and Philly natives, but they were interspersed with retirees and families. After we were seated, a server in requisite horn-rimmed glasses and worn-out t-shirt was at our table with menu and coffee (which was so damn good, it made you say aloud, ""that's damn good coffee) in less than two minutes. Order was taken shortly after and food was expedited within ten minutes. And efficiency should not be taken for being rushed. Efficiency is the mark of good, able service -- and it was reflected all around - from expediters to host to bussers to servers of other tables who took the time to say hello and smile, showing proof of a great operation.

Honey's Sit-n-Eat made us long for a place like this back in the DC 'burbs.

It was an affordable way to get a ton of food that wasn't great, but, hey, seeing as how I was usually at Larry's after a night of drinking, quality of food wasn't necessarily my biggest concern.

Unfortunately, now that I'm a ripe old 29, Larry's doesn't really do it for me anymore. Even the nostalgia is pretty much gone, as the whole place has been remodeled since back in the day. Too bad they didn't remodel their food, because it's still the same super greasy, almost totally flavorless cheesesteak that I remember it being.

That being said, you do get an enormous amount of food for a decent price. And, while I admit the steak itself has no flavor, adding pepperoni to the sandwich helps immensely.

Ultimately, Larry's is for the college crowd, and the steak bombs that they serve up there really do cater to exactly what an empty stomach needs at 2 am.

I have to admit that I was skeptical about going in there, yes I watch the show but I was worried that this bar would be resting on the reputation that Rob M. is a part-owner, and I was happy that they simply just made this a neighborhood bar to hang out in and not some homage to It's Always Sunny.

Lunch: I'm a vegetarian so sometimes it's hard to find a good veggie friendly sandwich. I really love their hummus, cucumber, tomatoes and pepper sandwich. SO GOOD!

Drinks: Okay, so I'm not actually a big fan of their drinks, hence the lower rating. I just really don't think they're that good. I don't know why.

The service was attentive and very pleasant and I really enjoyed chatting briefly with the peripatetic, friendly, and all around very cool chef, Jen Zavala (she toured with one of my favorite bands, Pantera).  While the jalapeño ""poppers"" were not listed on the brunch menu, the kitchen was kind enough to let us order some - I wish I had ordered many more!  Beautifully coated and delectably stuffed, the heat of these fresh beauties went perfectly with the sweet apricot-pepper jam as accompaniment.  

We then tried the chili and a side order of chorizo - both were not really to our taste.  While the chili was full of nicely cooked pieces of meat, it completely lacked any genuine chili flavor and tasted instead like tomato soup.  The chorizo was strangely bland - I ended up dunking it in the assertively spicy barbecue sauce that accompanied my St. Louis ribs.  As for the ribs, I liked the texture of the meat but for the life of me could not detect any tell-tale signs of their purported cooking method - by smoke (the reddish-pink uniform ring around each bone or a smoky redolence).  Good none-the-less, thickly covered with the above-mentioned spicy sauce and eaten with straightforward red cabbage slaw.  I was less intrigued by the brisket sandwich, a few pieces of (Wagyu) beef coated in baked beans on bread (the beans made the bread rather soggy),  but liked the Wagyu beef hash. 

Talking about Wagyu beef:  why does almost every joint in town list Wagyu beef on the menu these days?  Yes, I like a thick prime ribeye of Wagyu perfectly seared and believe it is worth the price - but pieces of little pieces of Wagyu slathered in baked beans or buried in hash browns and eggs - what's the point?  

At the end of our brunch, I was a little tired of the blaring and chipper 50s sound track but I intend to go back to ECR to give their larger BBQ selection on the regular menu a try.

I couldn't help and got the pourlerikio after reading about it from Katherine R. The organic baby chicken was so tender, juicy, and flavorful. I can still taste the chicken and it's been 13 hours later. I've been to other greek places and most dishes are either acidic or doused with honey, however, Kanella has a very good balance in the dishes. It is a little pricier, but I wouldn't mind paying more and not having to squint my eyes when I take a bite.

So our table started off with the bureki (fillo pastry filled with feta and thyme drizzled with thyme honey served with roasted beets) and sheftalia (grilled cypriot sausage with tzanziki). Like I said, I expected it to be soaked in honey, but it was just the right amount and none of it stuck to my teeth. The fillo pastry was airy and the filling was the perfect amount and not too strong. The sausages were so moist and aromatic. I'm also not a big fan of beets, but it was done well. I didn't feel like I wanted to spit it out.

I also got to taste the Papia (duck leg) - very juicy and tender too with a crunchy skin. Arni (lamb) - medium actually means med rare, which was perfectly done to me. It wasn't gamey. Katsaki (braised goat) - very soft. The meat practically falls apart when you pick it up with a fork and filled with delicious flavors.

PtAQGsADrJyEanV9xFcBlw,OExmdhEdcKHQQqXrv6ftTg,JUlsvVAvZvGHWFfkKm0nlg,4,3,1,3,"3 1/2 stars, really.

I can't say 2 or 3 stars due to: strong margaritas, awesome happy hour specials, great service, and the fact that food portions are really quite large and filling for the price.

I can't say 4 or 5 stars due to: sloppy presentation, $6 upcharge if you want your margarita frozen (?!), browned limes, and that fact that we ordered a Mango margarita for a $2 upcharge and it came out tasting absolutely nothing like mango.

The menu is VERY big and split between 2 cuisines, which is always a nice touch: Mexican and BBQ.  I will most likely probably never order Mexican food from here, since it's along the same lines of Cantina where you're overpaying for non-authentic and bland food.  However, I'm kicking myself for not getting the unlimited chips and salsa since I hear good things.  We opted to start with the grilled Mexican corn, which was very, very tasty with a delicious crema and scallions on top, but the parmesan cheese wasn't really melted on there and looked unappetizing on the plate (read before re: sloppy presentation).  The limes on the plate were browning, which is always a turn off, but whatever.

We ordered a pitcher of classic mango margarita on the rocks. I was excited because one thing Cantina does have going for it is the margaritas, so I assumed this place would taste like that- where the mango is infused in the flavor.  Not one bit.  It was a decent margarita, don't get me wrong, but it just tasted like the basic lime flavor.  The bottom was more yellow, so we were hoping that by the time we got there, it would taste more like mango, which it didn't.  What it did have were hundreds of tiny specks of mango chunks, just small enough to not pick out of the drink and irritating enough to make me wonder why they didn't use a strainer to get the bits out before they served it.  Luckily, it was damn strong and rendered roughly 3 glasses for each of us, so totally worth it (especially at half price for happy hour).  Just stick to the classic flavors and you'll be set.  

FYI: the glasses they served us with salt were only like a quarter covered in salt, rather than brimming with it.  The limes on our glasses were also browning.

For entrees, I ordered the Texas cheesesteak off the regular menu and the BF ordered a Texas cheeseburger with bacon, onion rings & BBQ sauce off the discounted happy hour food menu.  Both were very tasty and filling and served with seasoned fries that sort of tasted like BBQ chip seasoning.  My cheesesteak was giant with pretty tender ribeye and served on a really fresh roll and smothered in a delicious cheese sauce, fried onions, and deep fried jalapenos for a kick.  The smoked ketchup on the side was VERY smoky, but grew on me throughout the meal and paired really nicely with the sandwich.  The burger was also very good and served on a nice big bun, but my BF said it really didn't need the onion rings, since they turned to mush under the weight of everything.

BONUS: I didn't even realize until after the fact you could order any of the sandwiches in a toasted wrap form, which is always a good option.

The meal before tip was under $50 after all was said and done and I had a buzz, so I'd say it's definitely worth the trip during happy hour.

Overall, I would still love to come back here for those bangin' happy hour specials alone, as well as try the infamous Chronic sandwich and MAYBE fajitas or quesadillas if I'm feeling adventurous.

Places that are so busy all the time lose something.  Village whiskey is expensive.  It's not necessarily too expensive.  I just don't think the quality matches the quantity of bills I spend there.

On my day off, I sit around here and think, 'Where am I going to eat today?'  I can spend $7 on excellent Pho.  $15 on Dim Sum.  $20 at Han Dynasty...  or I can spend anywhere from $40-$80 at Village Whiskey and probably get worse service.

We were killing time before our tour of Independence Hall in Philadelphia - having travelled from California.  Fell into the Red Owl because it was convenient to the tour and were very happy we did.

We were staying at the other Kimpton Hotel in the city, the Hotel Palomar, so it was interesting to compare it to the Monaco of which this restaurant seems to be part of.  The Red Owl is very dense in that there is a lot of steel and design going on, as well as visual activity with the full bar, corner location and upper level of dining.  But it was all good and their menu is big which was a good thing for us.

Wife had a cheesesteak sandwich and I opted for mussels in a curry sauce with an order of fries - all of which were classically good.  We never did get around to the venerated Philly cheesesteak joints - this was a close as we got to them.  Service was great, nice and quick and got us to the tour right on time.

And, based on recent visits, it's clear that the greater the blanket of snow and ice that covers the city, the longer the wait for scarce counter and small table space at Cheu.  The block is quiet, the exterior fairly nondescript, but open the door and pull back the heavy curtain and you are thrown into a teeming mass of eager foodie fanatics.  The narrow, crowded kitchen is brimming with electric energy, all in full view:  steam rising from pots, broth being ladled in every direction, gas flames leaping around small pans on the stove, and noodles torn with artful precision.  

Everything that emerges from the kitchen is a unique, creative, and fresh concoction with a masterful balance of the five basic tastes.  The appetizer special was a dazzling combination of sauteed mustard greens, toasted farro, and miso dressing, topped with a handful of crispy fried lotus, a fabulous flavor and texture scheme.  The regular menu features a small plate (which could really be a meal) consisting of broccoli sauteed with ample morsels of Vietnamese sausage and tossed with crushed peanuts and unidentifiable but magical spices.  

Both of our noodle dishes were superb and completely different.  The spicy shrimp noodles come in a bowl crowded with bean sprouts, green onion, greens, and shaved daikon, topped with lightly fried shrimp balls.  The broth had the red hue and subtle kick of chilis and the noodles were microscopically thin.    The stars of the Sichuan bowl are thick, delicious, hand-torn wheat noodles coated in hot bean paste and stir-fried to a slight crisp.  Interspersed with the noodles are bright greens and diced fresh tofu, and the dish is finished with sesame seeds and ribbons of cucumber.  

Despite the rather raucous and cramped setting, the staff at Cheu are meticulous and generous in providing individual attention.  My revelation of a mushroom allergy touched off a vigorous discussion about which dishes could be created with different combinations of broths and sauces to avoid fungi.  On my second visit, a friendly Cheu employee noted my overcoat covered and dripping with melting snow (as, no doubt, did everyone there), grabbed it and whisked it back to a secret hiding spot in the back of the house to dry.  

One note of caution:  avoid making a visual estimate of the wait times for a table.

I really like the lounge part of this place because it's relaxing and gives a nice place for friends to hang out but still kind of feel like you're at home with a couch.  
The music is very hip hop-ish though.  For a Saturday night, it really was not busy at all and no show girls.  The bartender charged 2 different prices for same drink, it's pretty common thing that happens but 
Some improvements that this place could use:
1.  Change up the music, instead of playing all hip hop, play some classics
2.  Add some games such as dices (this concept is similar to ones in HK where people just chill and drink, play some dice games).  This would increase the likelihood of people buying more drinks hence increasing profitability

I can see from the review that it isn't for everyone. For instance, if you don't want pizza, you should really consider another restaurant. This place isn't for you. If you want NY, Chicago, or Boise style pizza then it's not for you.

The wine is pretty mediocre but it's only $24/500ml, which is not expensive for Philly.

As for the pizzas, this is my favorite place in town. The pizza doughs are individually raised at the right temperature, expertly spun, and wood-fired to perfection. They're springy, light and tasty, just like they are in Europe. Marc Vetri uses tipo 00 flour, so this is how pizza should be.

It's best enjoyed with a friend at the pizza bar, or as a group of friends, and it can get loud. Honestly this isn't a place for a date, unless you're both pizza lovers. Enjoy!",2015-05-02 04:41:38,"{'food': ['pizza'], 'drink': ['wine']}"

My friend and I tried to come here twice and both times, there was a 25-minute wait so we decided to wait the second time.

Once we were finally seated, I realized why there was a consistent wait. This place has pretty limited seating. Including the bar area, there are only about 20 seats total. The bar area is somewhat cramped so you're literally elbow to elbow with those on either side of you. At the bar, you're also naturally facing the somewhat small kitchen. I like watching cooks at work and I saw that they make their own noodles, which is nice. 

I got the miso ramen ($13). It was good and the broth was flavorful and not too salty but I thought the portion size and the amount of meat was a little lacking for that price.

Upon arrival are reservations were looked up and we had a few minute wait at the bar but being we were 45 min early we were seated within 10 min which was great. 

We were served nice Italian seeded bread which was good. Me and my date enjoyed 2 main dishes with her enjoying the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken which looked very delicious and I enjoyed the Black Lobster Ravioli's with scallops and olives in scampi sauce very good and hit the spot. Serving size and quality was very competitive with other establishments. 

We did not opt for desert as we were pretty stuffed but the desert selection did look tasty.

One thing me and my date enjoyed about this place was the very close feel of being a family, the tables are close the atmosphere is a bit loud but you feel like your one big Italian family enjoying a meal and the history behind the place add's to this.

I would definitively return to Ralph's and enjoy some of the wider selection of meal's next time especially some of the Veal selection's they have.

Aside from the ignorant hostess (short blond hair, older woman) and the lack of appropriate # of servers for the amount of people, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner with family and a friend (party of 5).

Our waiter Vinny was fantastic and very social BUT spread way too thin which meant longer wait times on drinks, no serving spoons for the family style served mashed potatoes and string beans for the table and forever to get coffee to go with our desserts (coffee arrived after everyone was done). Our tip appropriately complimented Vinny as a great server, it isn't his fault they don't have enough wait staff. Monday (the following day) they had over 500 people coming with only 8 servers staffed. Think about that. Last night there were approximately 350 diners, and it showed in attentiveness of the wait staff. Again, NOT the servers fault at all, Vinny was great. 

They have a full service bar and extensive wine list but it is also BYOB so we enjoyed our favorite wines.

I went to dinner here with 3 friends. Here's a timeline of our dinner: Reservation for 6:15. Sat at 6:20. Ordered about 6:30. First meal served (a salad) at 6:50. 7:00 bread requested because we were tired of waiting for food. Next two entrees served at 7:13. Bread delivered at 7:19. My pizza was served at 7:44. We then ran to our movie at the ritz to arrive only 5 minutes late for the 8:00 show.  In the entire time we were sitting there, our waitress refused to acknowledge us after she originally took our order until we called over a manager. One friend ordered a second wine, which was not served until she was finished her meal 20 minutes later, after we reminded multiple servers that we had ordered it. The rest of us never were given the opportunity to order a second round. When my pizza was finally served, we called the manager over to point out the fact that everyone else had finished their meals, while mine had only just arrived. The excuse we were given was, ""Our pizza oven is only so big."" (So I guess that's a tip - if you do bother going here, don't order the pizza.) It was also under cooked. Finally when we did get the bill, they had comped us for the pizza, but charged us for THE BREAD - the bread we'd asked for only because we weren't being served our meals. There was one competent waitress that felt bad for us and at least filled our waters throughout (because our waitress obviously wasn't doing it) and got us the to go pizza box - thanks red head waitress. These guys will go out of business as quickly as everything else that's been in that spot if they keep hiring staff based on their bra size.

That's not a bad thing, but I was decidedly underwhelmed.  I had been hearing the burger raves for months, but had also heard about the 2-hour waits.  I had been waiting for just the perfect occasion, and it came on a random Wednesday afternoon at 3:30 while entertaining an out of town friend.  

Garces has done a very nice job with the space, and has achieved a classy, old-school bar vibe.  The tiles and woodwork are beautifully restored, the mirrors are antiqued to perfection, most of the light fixtures are charming.  In light of how-well designed everything else seemed to be, the cheap white metal fluorescent fixtures above the bar with label glue still staining them stood out like sore thumbs.  But I digress . . .

We claimed a primo table by the bar and set out to enjoy the ""best burger in Philly"".  Our waiter was very friendly, helpful with beer selections, and solicitous without being intrusive.  My friend went with the burger as described on the menu; I added cheddar.  We split an order of duck fat fries and washed it all down with beer.  To get right down to business, the burgers (both ordered medium) were good.  They were so good that I did not even mind paying $10 for them.  However, they were NOT the best burgers in Philly.  Both were slightly overcoooked, and the meat, while juicy, would have benefited from a bit more salt or seasoning.  If I had waited 2 hours for the experience, I would have been right pissed.  The duck fat fries were very good - crunchy on the outside, redolent with duck fat flavor, and filled with fluffy potato-y goodness.  Though the order looked on the small side, they were rich enough that the two of us could not finish them.

I expect I will be back to Village Whiskey.  I really dug the vibe, and I saw some intriguing cocktails being prepped with tender-loving-care at the bar.  I was entranced by the shaving of limes and muddling of herbs.  Speaking of cocktails, I ordinarily loves me some whiskey and the list at Village was pretty spectacular.  It makes it all the more sad that I will probably not be having any of them there.  The mark-ups were fairly ridiculous, especially since good whiskey does not really require any Iron Chef magic.",2010-05-24 19:08:39,"{'food': ['burger', 'duck fat fries'], 'drink': ['beer']}"

Food was very good  - had the grilled chicken shishkabob - perfectly cooked and delicious! Kids liked the Spanikopita as well as the meatball's over penne.  Waitress was not helpful at all - maybe caught her on a bad/off day.  Great table bread and pita with the humus.


My Ratings:
5* - Unfreaking believable.  Just the thought of going makes me drool.
4* - Very good. Would recommend to anyone.  Would be happy to return again. 
3* - Meh
2* - Not very good. Would only return if there were no other options.
1* - I know its arrogant to say it, but they should really close up shop. They've proved to me they don't give a sh@t.",2012-06-02 01:41:49,

Finally got a chance to try all their fancy donuts.  They very yummy but too sweet for my liking but delicious nonetheless.  The pumpkin spice latte is by far by favorite.  All of their hot fresh donuts are actually better to me and you get two for price of one fancy donuts.  

Their coffee is great and better than many coffee joints around the city.  Best of everything.  Just wish they served chicken sooner, like for breakfast :)",2014-02-07 17:42:55,"{'food': ['fried chicken', 'donuts'], 'drink': ['pumpkin spice latte', 'coffee']}"

Everyone liked everything they ate. The highlights were definitely:

1) The dips of the day. Holy cow, I can't say enough good things about these. If they served an entree-sized portion, I could definitely eat just these.
2) The phyllo/honey/feta appetizer concoction. Unreal. Must order.

As for the entrees, I really enjoyed my veal dish. Everyone at the table ordered something different--lamb, veal, suckling pig, stuffed vegetables, fresh fish of the day. All were very tasty--there was nothing left on anyone's plate. The desserts were also surprisingly tasty, especially given that I'm generally indifferent about Greekish desserts. *Very* impressed with this meal. If I weren't moving in a few weeks, I'd go back.

That said, it's a teensy bit pricey. But at least it's BYO, so you save a bit there.",2010-05-19 13:29:18,"{'food': ['dips', 'phyllo/honey/feta appetizer', 'veal dish', 'stuffed vegetables', 'fresh fish of the day'], 'drink': []}"

Hubby & I willingly joined the queue & after about 35 minutes of shivering out front (mitigated somewhat by the propane heater thoughtfully set up by the restaurant) we were allowed entry to this most hallowed of Port Fishington venues.
Once the thought of French toast with Nutella, strawberries & creme anglaise entered my brain nothing else would do. Verdict: dee-lish! The strawberries were thawed from frozen but hey, it's December. I imagine they're fresh in season. My scrambled egg on the side was just ok, a little overcooked for my taste.
Hubby really enjoyed his mushroom & veggie sausage omelet with home fries which I tasted & thought were excellent. 
I'd been keeping my fingers crossed that the coffee would be good but it wasn't. It was great!!! Truly the best coffee I've had anywhere this year! 
I'd noticed the mixed reviews here about Honey's staff & had been fearing the worst but they couldn't have been nicer - from our waitress Hannah (sp?) to the guy who filled our water glasses everyone was as pleasant as could be.
My one quibble would be the music volume. It should really be toned down when the place is full. Mixed with the cacaphony of people talking it was a bit much.
