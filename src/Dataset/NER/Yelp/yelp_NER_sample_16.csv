We started with the Zeus appetizer, which could easily be a meal in itself if you want to try a little of everything.  The grilled octopus was phenomenal and the sauce was so good, I had to use the crusty bread to sop it up. I also highly recommend the stuffed eggplant.

Coffee was burnt..
The waffles seemed like they were right out of a microwave. Rubbery and tasteless (the server gave them high marks)....

Kanella is a perfect example of delicious, well-prepared, nose to tail eating.  The chef is talented and eccentric, a classic cutter of his nose to spite his face.  Frequently railing against on-line review sites, such as yelp, and engaging in heated verbal battles with various food critics, whether their reviews were good or bad.  The nice thing for him, is that he can get away with it.  Fearless preparation of whole branzino, pork cheeks and salty, fishy tampenades allow the simple ingredients to shine through.  I've only been here once and thoroughly enjoyed myself with similar feelings shared among all my friends that have Kanella in their regular rotation.

The inside had a nice sports bar feel and it looked like a good place to catch a game. From the start though, the service wasn't that great. It took a really long time after we sat down before a server even took our drink orders. It just seemed like a really long wait for everything: taking our orders, getting our food, asking for the bill, etc. 

We got the gravy fries as an appetizer and I got the jack stack burger for my meal:

Mac's gravy fries - This is their version of poutine. The actual pieces of short rib were really good. The meat itself was tender and pretty flavorful. The fries were wide cut and not too crispy. I thought the gravy was a little thin and I would've preferred if the cheese was a bit more melted. I definitely thought this dish was way overpriced, especially for the amount you get. 

Short Rib Jack Stack Burger - After reading the descriptions of everything on the menu I knew this was the one for me. Whenever another meat is a topping on a burger, I'm a fan. This burger had the same braised short rib from the fries on top of the burger. It also came with a nice mango-habanero ketchup, which didn't have as much of a kick as I was expecting. 

My friend also wanted the jack stack burger, as he's also a fan of some meat on meat action. But he wanted wanted his burger without cheese. Pretty simple request right? Well, our server came back to our table and said the burger had to be served as is and he couldn't take special requests such as ordering it without cheese. Excuse me? I understand it's hard to accommodate a request if things were pre-made or an ingredient was heavily integrated into the dish, but we're not asking you to change the burger recipe, just don't put the damn slice of cheese on it! I didn't really get it. My friend ended up having to order something else on the menu because of this.

I actually thought the food was pretty good, although a little on the expensive side. However with the combination of the slow service and ridiculous inflexibility of the menu items, I wasn't really satisfied with my trip to Mac's Tavern.",2015-06-01 04:38:58,"{'food': ['gravy fries', 'short rib jack stack burger'], 'drink': []}"

Short: Nice folks, great and creative dog on a superb roll, wish there were more side dishes.

Less Short: I went to Hot Diggity for the first time, thanks to a great offer on LevelUp ($6 off your first purchase). 'Desert Dog' + Soda for $8, perfectly reasonable. The bun was really good (chewier and more substantial than a normal roll), the dog itself was really good (thin and long, crisped nicely), and the toppings were very good (pinto beans, tortilla strips [which fell out constantly], green salsa [which could have had more kick], chopped onion and tomato). The pinto beans worked with the tomato and onion to give the impression of a fresh tasting, less messy, less fatty chilli. Recommended. 

Also, the guys behind the counter were very nice. 

Only criticism: give us at least one not-french-fry side dish. I mean, look: I LOVE fries. And I've heard good things about their's. But I'm already eating a hot dog, which, for me, is somewhat guilt inducing. Give me a side of stewed greens, or succotash, or something as a side dish option that isn't even worse for me than the dog. Aside from that, great spot for a workday lunch.

Indeed, there are restaurants that I go often, that they remember my orders, and that I tips decently (20%) - and I still see frown faces.

So, this is a nice change in this restaurant - which the waitress was friendly and with a smile when taking order.  And also inquiring whether I want water or tea.

The beef noodle is good - with quite a bit of beef, brisket and meatball.  The beef is tender, and the meatball is al dente.  The broth and noodle are decent though not wow.

They do takeout, and like most if not all Chinatown noodle shop- they will separate the soup and noodle if requested (keeping the noodle al dente)

Overall, it is a 3.5 but given that they were willing to accept $11 for a $11.34 bill - as they didn't realize that I have change.  That gives them a 4 star.

If you're a vegetarian, carnivore or omnivore, you're sure to find something appetizing here. The cold appetizer plate is small-ish, but loaded with different Greek delights including, hummus, other hummus, yogurt hummus type of thing, babaganoush and spicy feta, which looks like all of the other stuff on the plate, but is spicy and wonderful.

There's some octopus dip too, but the tentacles were a little much for me...now that I want an octopus as a pet.

Order two pitas - fluffy, light and warm, these are absolutely the quintessence of Greek pita.

We had the Family style ""tasting"" menu at $65/pp and some highlights included the Pimento cheese starter which tasted like cheese salsa on crack served with toast. It was so good I wanted to run out and buy a bag of tortilla chips and savor every last spoonful of queso. We also enjoyed the Fat Ham board aka Kevin Sbraga's brand of Charcuterie genius which consists of silky liver mousse and pate served over toast and literally fat ham defining it's own name.  I also absolutely loved the pork rinds with cheese sauciness. I never thought of ever using pork rinds to substitute eating it as nachos but the idea works. I know what to do at next year's Super Bowl party. The drinks were also very complementary of the meal as the Memphis Mule is the type of cocktail you want if you are into ginger. Good thing I am. The negatives - while the Hot fried chicken and oyster sliders are popular items here and they weren't necessarily bad but it did not blow me away either.  I attribute this to the inherent nature of a family style tasting menu at a southern deep fried eatery.  All you're getting after awhile is a lot of cholesterol and I certainly felt my blood pressure rising with each course.  My opinion of this place may have been different if I had ordered the traditional way but I still felt the fried chicken was overpowered with spice and the oyster slider lacked harmony between the bun and oyster which is an essential requirement for success for any sandwich. I felt it more enjoyable to just leave the roll and eat the oyster alone.  Of the three desserts offered the Mississippi Mud Pie is the must get item, a clever concoction of chocolate gooey ness in a mason mug.

Also a neighbor is doing construction so maybe that could of added to it.  
The set up of the store is very simple and easy to understand.  The menus are easy and you can see all the fresh ingredients.  You can choose any and everything you want. It reminds of a pasta bar, salad bar but most of all a chipotle. 
This place had an awful smell, there was this unexplainable smell in the air. It hits you right when you walk in and it just lingers.  I was suppose to get 4 pokes all together but I only got 3 because I didn't want one for myself. That's how much the smell turned me off.  So I just shared w my family. 

We had house classic, ahi on fire and the sweet and spicy trio.  
The fish was not fresh, even the color was off when I was at the store. This goes for all 3 bowls minus the octopus in the trio.  
The sauce was mediocre and the rest of the ingredients were fine but the fish omg the fish just looked bad. 
Any sushi person can tell you that if the fish is fresh you can just eat it fresh, no crazy sauce needed. But you had to mask these fish.  The fish wasn't rancid or foul but it just wasn't fresh. When I went to pay for my bowls There was this young guy working off to the side close to the register and cutting up the tuna, it was not appealing.  The way the fish was being handled and the way the tuna looked crumbling, the way the chunks were being ripped out, the bones that were being pulled out. You ever seen someone just ""smush""something around and it doesn't look appetizing? I was just happy I didn't buy a bowl for myself at that point.

I would totally give Gianna's 2.5 stars instead of 3 but I'm feeling generous and a little nostalgic.  I remember discovering Gianna's when it opened on Walnut Street many, many years ago.  I'm old folks, deal with it, I have.  It was such a rush to be able to order a vegan cheesesteak and get some vegan cake in the city of Philadelphia.  This was before it was old hat, back when a vegetarian had to scramble to find something he or she could eat on most menus.  I mean, I was in fat kid heaven.  Then they moved to 6th and South, which sucked for me at the time since I used to live in Fairmount and it was pretty close.  I kept visiting for many years and their menu kept growing and they kept me happy.  Then something happened (and I'm not referring to the non-vegan cheese they were ""accidentally"" passing off as vegan, though that did totally suck) and Gianna's just never recovered.   My last few visits have been absolutely awful.  

The place is straight up dirty now and the counter staff look gross and disheveled.   Was that your nipple I saw when I placed my order? Hmmm. I'm all for wearing what you want but hey keep your boobs out of my food please!  

I used to be in love with their pizza but lately the slices seem like crusty slabs of sadness.  Employee warnings, threats, schedules, etc. hang on the wall for all to see.  The prices have increased and the quality of the food has decreased.    The desserts went downhill once they started baking their own (many years ago) from what one may deduce as borrowed concepts from the previous desserts made by Vegan Treats. 

One thing that I will continue to credit Gianna's for is their bike powered delivery team. I see them all over and I've been there when they've gone out and come back in all while I was waiting on my order.  They are fast.

Basically, if you get there early, you have a better chance at being able to negotiate through want you want. I suggest you come hungry, and bring cash.

A quiet confidence that does very little to give away the quality of food within.

A small dining room with an even smaller capacity for parties of 6, it took a while to coordinate our visit.  Decor is well coordinated and actually quite demure given the price tag.  A relaxing, welcoming atmosphere that helps detach you from the center city bustle.  Service is excellent, no surprise there.
  
Some things I remember from the meal.  A platter of bite sized cured meats, foie gras, and salad was first.  Served family style, it was a good way to try a lot of small items and get things started.

Little monkfish, fried whole, arrived in the table center.  No need to coax us in with the deftly intact lore hovering over its grouchy under bite, the presentation was all the enticing we needed.  Delicious, creative, and a perfect fish to serve whole since the edible area is free of bones. 

Asparagus flan tagged along with the monkfish, and really got overshadowed in spite of being smooth and flavorful.

Sweet onion crepe with truffle fondue was delicious and among the consensus favorites.  

Lamb Chorizo with fava and mint.  Subtle kick, excellent when there was a mint-heavy bite.

Spinach gnocchi with brown butter was a table favorite with its deep green color.

Almond Tortellini with truffle sauce.  Like an almond cookie in delicate pasta, it was interesting despite being a little less complex than some other courses.

Braised veal breat with endive salad was good on its own, but the Barolo pairing really helped take it to the next level.  

Speaking of wine, we opted for the grand pairing and for the most part it was outstanding.  An nice mix of wines focusing mainly on Italy and its immediate neighbors, they were an excellent complement to the food.  Passito with dessert was exactly what I was hoping for.

Vetri really stuck to a strong Italian inspiration in their dishes, which may seem kind of obvious, but at the same time the drive for creativity and presentation at this level of restaurant can at times strip out all traditional cultural references from the food.  I liked that they retained some of that feeling, even though it sometimes left the dishes suffering from a shallower flavor.
 
Pacing was perfect, translating to just over 3 hours.
 
Some dishes weren't as big of a hit, but that happens even at the best places.  It can be hard to tell where a great restaurant leaves off and great company kicks in sometimes.  I'll say that we undoubtedly had a fantastic time, and I feel confident saying Vetri is among the best dining experiences in the Philadelphia region.",2012-07-24 20:39:25,"{'food': ['platter of bite sized cured meats', 'foie gras', 'salad', 'little monkfish', 'fried whole', 'asparagus flan', 'sweet onion crepe', 'lamb chorizo with fava and mint', 'spinach gnocchi with brown butter', 'almond tortellini with truffle sauce', 'braised veal breat with endive salad'], 'drink': ['passito with dessert']}"

Our server was Megan. She was knowledgable, personable, funny, witty, discreet (in just looking at me and didn't have to ask if I wanted another sangria - I just had to nod!) One person at our table had the beverage pairing with his meal and each time she arrived with a new beverage after we all recieved our next course, she gave a mini lesson on either the origin of the drink or why it paired well with the course. It was interesting and not forced nor did it come off rehearsed. It was like she was having a conversation with a new friend and was excited to tell them about it.

The pricing was a steal and I would have easily paid more for the 4 courses. It was a steal at $49.00 per person (beverage pairing is additional $35.)

First Course:
Shrimp Scampi Soup with Popcorn. Nope, you did not read that wrong...I said popcorn folks! My friend and I both ordered this choice and were a bit disappointed when we recieved our small crocks with no popcorn in sight. It wasn't until my 3rd spoonful did I recieve a small little popcorny crunch. I haven't the slightest idea how they kept something crunchy in the velvety cream based soup but they did. It was a nice surprise and something that was immediately sampled around the table. (Yes, we are those people that try each other's food...we only dine with other foodies that are like this. **We ask for extra clean folks and spoons when needed**)

Second Course:
Grilled Octopus. A new texture for me as I have only had octopus prepared as sashimi in the past. It was not mushy, not chewy and not 'seafoody'. It was just right. Complimented by a spicy sauce *that Megan forwarned me about before I placed my final order* and crunchy chick peas and asparagus. A nice change and a very light course.

Third Course:
Spring Lamb. I don't do lamb normally. Had it many years ago presented as ""lamb lollipops"" at room temperature and DID NOT like it. But I was up to try it just one more time. Megan explained how it was prepared....slow roasted for 8-10 hours and the lamb was local and butchered at their restaurant (obviously guaranteeing peak freshness). Welp, I am now a believer in lamb and want to try to make this at home. It fell apart with a simple touch of my fork. Moist and flavorful with complimenting subtle spiced and pearl onions. 

Fourth Course:
I went for the cheese plate which was the perfect ending to my meal. An Asian Pear Jam, Cow's Milk Cheese the texture of Gruyere, little red grapes and a zippy gorganzola cheese to round out my plate. This will their divine fresh press coffee - (try it without sugar....it's that good).

Lastly I need to make mention of the freakin' amazing bartender that makes a White Sangria like no other that I have ever had. Any sangria experiences after Saturday will be ranked againest yours, they were THAT TASTY!!

The beer-battered green beans really are as good as Yelp says! We should've ordered more. I've never met a mac n cheese I didn't like, but this one had a gluey texture that put me off a bit.

The potato salad was just so so for me, but I was too busy stuffing my face full of Tilapia to share my attention with some potatoes. My mom loved her breakfast and raved about the ham in particular.

Food: 

-Breakfast: For those breakfast lovers out there, there are a lot of great breakfast options available and is served all day!

-What I get: I usually go for dinner. I'm a sucker for brisket and usually get Bubby's brisket sandwich, it is slow cooked brisket, served on a brioche bun with really good horsey mayo, swiss, and spinach. It also comes with pickled cabbage, and green tomato. The fries are handcut and very good (does not come with sandwich). Everything else I've ever ordered here has been fantastic, everything is cooked well, and has really good flavor. 

Their fresh limeade is awesome! I Highly recommend it.

The only downside is the menu is enormous and is sometimes overwhelming if you don't know what you're in the mood for. Also, they are VERY busy during breakfast and brunch times. I often walk/drive by and there is a line out the door waiting to be seated. It's usually pretty safe to go for dinner on a week night though.

I was not blown away in the least.  Sadly.  There is always plenty of room in this city for a fantastic Asian Fusion restaurant, and Cheu just didn't get it up for me.

Small plates were neither special or memorable -  For example, wings though perfectly crunchy, lacked the zing or enough black garlic sauce to differentiate them against any other wings in the city (perhaps except for the crunch factor); the sweet potato rangoon, was just that, and the brown butter and goat cheese somehow got lost on me.  

Their noodle dishes left me wanting so much more, as I have had far superior noodle/ramen dishes both in fusion-esque Chinatown locales (duh) and specifically Nom Nom Ramen (whose broth, flavor profile and ingredients trump Cheu's noodle dish by far)  The broths across most of the noodle dishes lacked the depth of developed flavor, and the ingredients just seemed rather ho-hum (the greens for example, seemed to be both under-cooked and over-cooked, over steamed; the pork shoulder lacked spice, was overdone)

The atmosphere seemed cozy enough upon walking in, but that's about the only good thing I can say about it. 

The guy behind the counter was very soft spoken, which made it hard to hear what he was saying. He also seemed a bit confused and almost forgot part of my order.

I ordered a chai latte, but it was not actually made with tea or concentrated tea as it should have been. It was water, chai flavor syrup, and milk. 

The steamer had not been cleaned off properly from the previous person, and after he made my chai he wiped it halfheartedly, leaving some foam still remaining. 

When I picked up the cup, it was extremely light. I discovered that my drink was half foam. I tilted the cup way back to get some of the actual drink, and burned my tongue. The drink was not cool enough even to sip for about 30 minutes. Once I was finally able to drink it, it was still full of foam and also left a weird taste in my mouth (probably due to not even being made of tea). I threw it out.

""it comes with chicken""
i said "" yes but how many pieces""
she said ""a lot""
""so that means about 4 or 5""
""maybe""

ummm what? i wonder if she even worked there sometimes. the food was sub par... they use cheese wiz on their nachos, and too much cheese wiz as that. i had to get up and find my own bottle of ketchup for my friends soggy fries. and i was surprised that after asking what the house dressing was that would come on my side salad and being told that it was a vinaigrette... when in all actuality it was Caesar. 

paying the bill was interesting because we gave her a credit card and she asked if we needed change... and the credit card wasn't in a check book so that probably lets you know how smart she really is. and it took her about 20 minutes to bring the bard back to us and she waited over our shoulders to see how much tip we were leaving. now that's classy.

Numerous times in the past, I've never had a chance to dine here simply because I mostly used to do day trips to Philly and Vetri only opens for dinner. So this time when I was here in Philly over a long weekend, I made sure to stop by Vetri before I headed out of Philly.

This was the first time I've tasted foie gras terrine in a smoky and really delicious manner. Thumbs up for this even though the thought of the combi may have put me off a lil initially.

Thereafter, I had the spinach gnocchi for my main.

While I have had spinach gnocchi at other places before, the one here is out of the ordinary. Their gnocchis are sized like brusselsprouts and have a deep olive green color - literally rolled up spinach and flour with more spinach than flour content perhaps?

It was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time, but I don't think it was worth $26. Yes it had bakery quality bread, fancy sounding cheese, applewood smoked bacon, and caramelized onion, but I still think $26 is overly expensive. Especially, when it's angus versus Kobe beef. They do have a plain burger for $13, but there's no toppings and they charge about $2.50 per topping. To top things off, my can of apple cider was $6 and it's a local cider company from PA. Cider was good though. Most apple ciders are too sweet, but this one was just right. 

I could've had the sea bass at Vernick for almost the same price. $3 more actually. I'm not cheap and I'm very well traveled.

Service was slow and the place is small. I sat at the bar. It took about 40-45 min to get my burger. When I was finished with my cider, they took my glass and they never asked me if I wanted another.

First, one of our favorite beers that had been a mainstay for some time disappeared (but whatever). But then, the unthinkable happened. I tried to order their famous burger, as I have done many times before, and found out that it is an entirely different concept now (I guess due to the new chef?). First, I was told they could not cook it to any particular temperature (it only comes medium. What?). Then it came out and was two thin patties smothered in American cheese and grease on a somewhat lame bun. Also, the meat fell apart each time I took a bite. It tasted like a Shake Shack burger, which I enjoy, but in a very different I'm-starving-and-hungover-and-want-greasy-crap kind of way. The P&K burger was sheer perfection, and they ruined it. Why??

Once we were seated, we ordered from the Seasonal menu for the day.  My wife ordered the mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat.

So, here comes the Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops, they were nice sized and cooked as expected but the overall dish was lacking.   The scallops sat on a bed of diced vegetable that appeared to have been sautéed in a teriyaki sauce, nothing special about this dish.  My wife only ate the scallops, strike number 3 with her.  My dish was the ""Seasonal"" Rib-Eye.  The temperature of the steak was what I had request but it did not appear that it had been near a broiler of grill, again it was just lukewarm.  It looked like the steak was just cut from roast that had been precooked.  According to the menu, the side are supposed to have been personal sized but what we got was one each of the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, again not up to par to the high level you claim.

My answer: THE WINGS! 

Honestly, I think they're the best wings I've had in Philly, so crunchy on the outside and so juicy on the inside. They're somewhat pricey ($12 for 7 wings) but the wings are huge and meaty, so I usually only need 4-5 wings paired with some beer for a full meal. I loved both their flavors, but I'm slightly partial towards the soy garlic. Other items on the menu include a variety of Asian fusion dishes, but they seemed mediocre at best in my opinion. However, the service is excellent and meticulous (they gave us little wet wipes because the wings can be messy on the fingers) and the ambiance is upbeat and modern. Also, I tried one of their specialty cocktails, which was delicious, and I'd love to try more of them! As such, I'd definitely come back regularly for the wings and the drinks.

Anyway...

No complaints about the environment. It was definitely a cute little restaurant -converted from a house, it has indoor and outdoor seating with appealing decor (dont remember exactly what haha...but i remember thinking it was very tasteful).

The menu was typical of any mexican restaurant. We ordered drinks that were very small for the price tag. I don't know if the waitress was new, but she was pretty clueless about the menu items. We decided to keep it simple and order some traditional favorites. The queso fundido came out - tried and immensely disliked. It was basically spicy ground beef with cheese melted on top.

We had yet to have a bad or sub par meal during our work conference in Philly, however, our final night was a huge let down.  Maybe I had such high hopes from our previous dining options that I assumed everything was going to be top notch.  Not the case at La Scala's.  

To begin, service was horrific.  Upon entering for our 7:30 reservation, the host failed to greet us, the only ones in the entrance, and acted as if we interrupted him from doing absolutely nothing.  He unenthusiastically walked our party of six to our table and walked away having not said one word.  

Service throughout the meal was spotty as time and time again we had to re-request new silverware, dishes, and drinks as they would be off behind the bar joking around. Servers aslo were placing and snagging dishes away at inopportune times and to the wrong individuals all with an attitude.  I went up to the host mid meal to inform him that it was the birthday of one of our colleagues at our table.  Waiting a few moments for him to finish his text message and to stare at me blankly, I asked if they could do something.  One would not think this to be an overly excessive request, however, he responded ""I don't know, ask your server"".  Word from the server was that we could pay for a dessert, they could put a candle on it, but confirmed twice to me ""were not gonna sing, though, so you know"".  By no means did I even want them to sing.

Okay, enough about the service and on to the food.  It was fine.  Probably would have been better had I not been so preoccupied about the service. Our shared starters including the calamari, grilled artichokes, stuffed mushrooms were all good.  Ordering octupus whereever I can, I was a bit disappointed, as it was a bit chewy and too acidic.  The spicy tuna was substantial, but a bit too salty.  

Upon departure, and after spending upwards of $100 per person not a single person acknowledged our departure.  Overall, our group all agreed that the food was good.  However, a dining experience is not characterized on food alone.  Service has a lot to do with the experience, and due to the ""surly"" servers, I would rate this experience as unfavorable.",2012-04-12 18:55:00,"{'food': ['calamari', 'grilled artichokes', 'stuffed mushrooms', 'octupus', 'spicy tuna'], 'drink': []}"

We had soup to start - the Vegan Sausage and Greens soup was tasty, but clearly made with TJ's Soyrizo or something comparable.  The gumbo, while served in a cup that was more of a tablespoon, was excellent.  Rich, dark, and meaty with that deep warm spiciness.

Be aware when ordering the pulled pork: this is serious Carolina-style pulled pork.  No sweet saucy messes.  Just spicy vinegar tenderness.  The vinegar was so overwhelming at first that I actually chocked a little, but by the second bite you adjust, and all you can taste is that tangy bite of the mush-tender pork.

Being from out of town, we were looking for something easy and kid friendly. Jones is exactly that, but I expect a bit more for their prices. From the looks of the short menu, Jones seems to be the kind of place suitable for happy hour. 

We ordered the pirogies, a cheeseburger, chicken and waffles and a kids grilled cheese.  The pirogies had a great texture but were a little bland. The Belgian waffle was the best thing served and you only get half a waffle. The fried chicken was most disappointing. It was greasy, under seasoned and lukewarm. The kids grilled cheese was as expected, had we been in a diner. I cannot say for certain but the white cheese between two pieces of white bread looked and tasted like Kraft plastic cheese. The fries were good, and the burger (again) under seasoned.

And...it was expensive. But it was pretty good! It's supposed to have a southern spirit, so the grits (both kinds) were the star of the show. They really awkwardly didn't have the mac n cheese when we went in, so I might go back for it another time. They did make up for it, however, with the peanut banana pudding on the house, which was fairly spongey and light for a dessert - just what a needed after the heaviness of fried chicken, fried fish, grits, and a casserole. 

The waitress told us that we should order about 3 - 4 dishes per person, and she wasn't wrong. We thought we could get away with order just a couple to save some cash, but alas...we were still pretty hungry.

the coffee here is to die for. made from fair trade beans, their house blend has a full body of flavor. my favorite is the vanilla latte- iced or hot. it's silky and smooth with a hint of sweetness, but it doesn't overpower the coffee base. 

their brunch here is among my favorites. my personal favorites on the menu: 
-bacon stack- perfect amount of tasty bacon and arugula to add a little peppery kick
-salmon platter (on a brioche)- fresh lox, with capers, red onions, and dill cream cheese. you have to get their brioche! it's such wonderfully baked bread
-brekkie platter- when i am craving good old breakfast food. it's your standard eggs, bacon, and brioche. it sounds simple, but ants pants makes it satisfying & there is something about how they cook their eggs.....
-bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant- my guilty pleasure here. i have had many bacon, egg, & cheese croissant sandwiches, but again- there is something about the way they cook their food here that gives it an extra something special. the egg is fried to perfection, the bacon has just enough crisp but still a bit fatty, and the croissant is toasted slightly for that satisfying crunch. u just have to have one, trust me
-fruit and yogurt w/ granola- now i LOVE fruit & granola w/ yogurt. and every time i eat out for breakfast/brunch i try to order a serving and am consistently disappointed. usually the fruit is just not that fresh, which sucks bc they usually way overcharge for this item. at ants pants the fruit is ALWAYS fresh- i give it to them to always serve quality food, the yogurt is thick & smooth (not greek yogurt, in case you're wondering), and the granola is dense, not that flaky stuff. the best yogurt parfait you will ever have, hands down. 

I am personally not a fan of sweet potato fries in general, but everyone loves them here & i always see a bowl of them on every table, so if you are a fan- i would suggest you try them! their lunch sandwiches are also very good- fresh, and healthy.

Their tap-list is a bit lacking, but it did not seem like they were trying to be a craft beer bar, as is the case with many trendy places in the area.

Their food was very reasonably priced, and actually served in such large portions compared to what we expected that we had to take some home.  The bartender was friendly and willing to deal with our indecisiveness without complaint.

Smiths has 2 bars in separate rooms joined by an opening in the back. Interestingly - one side was full of hipsters, while the other seem to contain office workers and middle age types. Both seemed to find a way to have a good time.

The nachos came in a big bowl with a mix of toppings and cheese whiz, which was actually a nice change of pace. For 5 bucks during happy hour - you can't beat that.
Be sure to order a flatbread or two depending on the size of your group. They're much bigger than you'd expect, but all 3 flavors are delicious.  My only complaint was that the slices were a bit large considering they were for sharing within a group.

I've became a fan of Earl through my many trips to Vegas.  I would even ask my friends that were coming back to The OC to bring me back a sandwich.

This particular excursion wasn't with current Yelpers per se, but were it not for Yelp, I wouldn't have the guts to even drive into the city to try the newness.

That said, I walked into Ariana with some trepidation. Having read "" The Kite Runner"" and "" 1000 splendid suns"" I had an idea of Afgani cuisine, but would I like it?

I was meeting some good friends, old and new, for a pre Lost Finale meal, so the excitement was palpable. I was late and they had ordered some apps. I thought it better not to ask and just dig in as my mind somehow tortures me when given too much info. I was blown away! There was a delicious puff pastry filled with spices and cheese, and a sort of raviloi with garlic and meat sauce.  Both killed it.

For my entree, I ordered a spicy beef kabob over rice. I loved it! This along with the apps were almost remeniscant of my time in Greece, so they were very Mediterranean influenced ( or vice versa). 

The kabob was little mini meatloaves on a skewer with veggies. The waitress carefully pulled out the redhot skewers,  which saved me from burning my face on them. They were HOT but not obnoxiously so. I think I should order all my food like that, as a way of slowing me down so that I can actually enjoy a meal. I loved the rice and bread that accompanied it as well.

Other things on the table that I sampled, were a pumkin app and a cauliflower dish. Both impressed. We were stuffed and running late so we had to skip dessert, but it's something to look forward to for next time. 

Just a note that I ate my leftovers the next day without the luxury of being able to heat it up and it was also excellent cold. 

So chalk another ethnic cuisine off my list. Thanks to Yelp ( and specifically Eric and Aaron) for making this too easy. Any of you that were like me, thinking the Asian chicken at Wendys is exotic, can take my word for it. It's better to give these places a shot. There is life after hamburgers.",2010-05-27 22:28:46,

And I'm a Brooklynite; we were there to see a Mets / Phillies game, so I wanted to add some non-native perspective to what seems to be a great local fondness for these fries. 

I wonder if it really isn't EXCLUSIVELY a local thing: I'd heard so much about these fries and was definitely curious, but as we were waiting on line to get some, the more rational part of my mind kept telling me, Wait a minute, do you really wanna do this... you see, the all-pervasive aroma wafting from the concession stand was... well, weird. 

And when we got our order and actually tasted them, I found they tasted very bizarre, too. Just a very salty, very strongly-flavored spice mix that might work on crabs (I don't eat crabs, so I couldn't say), but to my palate, is ABSOLUTELY WRONG for French fries.

As a Greek with a discerning palate, I have to say it lived up to the hype. We started with the Dips of Day, which were colorful, creative, tasty and fresh, served with perfectly warm pita. It set the stage for our entrees.  I had the Organic Pork And Sieftali Kebab which was solid. I tried a bite of the shaksouka which was also delicious. The true standout though, hands down was the chicken kebab. Maybe the best I've had, juicy and tender, actually pillowy soft (had to be marinading in yogurt for over a day) and cooked to perfection. I had to tell the chef, in front of the open kitchen so I made my back to compliment him. He was appreciative and made his way to visit our table. By the end of the meal, were totally satiated when the dessert menu hit the table but decided to have the Galaktoboureko, which is THE dessert in Greece. It was out of this world, creamy, crunchy and the bits of orange rind in the syrup was a terrific addition. We considered getting a second piece, as we dipped our forks into the remaining orange syrup to scoop up the flavorful bits left but didn't want to be gluttonous. It is truly a gem and I was instantly jealous of my friend, who we were visiting, who lives down the street.

I recently was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that dictates that I am not allowed to consumer gluten in any capacity, and it's been quite a struggle. I haven't had coffee in a few weeks since I have started this journey, but keeping with my routine now, I had to ask if the coffee contained any gluten. (Sometimes it's hidden in preservatives, or used for flavoring, and it's harmful in any form.) The response I received, ""Yeah, there's no bread in our coffee"", was rude, inconsiderate, and made me feel about 3 inches tall. Clearly I am aware that there is no bread in your coffee, and perhaps you are not educated enough to understand that sometimes gluten is toxic to certain people and not all people are gluten free due to a diet fad; however, the response was neither warranted, nor what I would expect when paying 2.50 for a normal sized light roast coffee. I apologize if my question, which was regarding my health, was an inconvenience in the morning rush, but because of this statement, I will never return again. Service can make or break a business, and I sincerely hope that a statement like this one is an isolated incident, and that arrogant and inconsiderate statements are not frequently made to paying customers.

We were seated promptly and given a respectable complimentary bread basket.  They were out of calamari (which, based on reviews, seems to be a trend) so we both ended up starting with the petite jeweled salad.  It was quite nice, the carrots had a great flavour and it was lightly and perfectly dressed. 

She went with the seafood paella and I went with the salmon.  Much to her disappointment, the dish as described is not what arrived, as there were no mussels, oysters, or any seafood other than shrimp.  She liked the flavors, but did express her disappointment when the server came around to check on us.  The server very kindly comped her entire meal as a result, which was totally unexpected and is the reason for the 4th star.

The salmon was decent, but it was pretty salty as another reviewer mentioned, and I like salty.  It was also slightly more well-done than I would have preferred, but the rice and edamame it sat atop was quite delicious and I certainly ate all of it.  Desserts were panna cotta and the chocolate bar.  The chocolate bar was very good, but the ""mint gelee"" tasted like nothing.  Coconut crunch was a nice surprise.  The panna cotta was delicious and a very large serving.  My friend's comment was that it would be better if they had done a cold foam as opposed to putting steamed milk foam on top as it liquified some of the panna cotta and made it a little watery.

If you enjoy the anonymity and slight melancholy of the ""hotel bar"" but wish to avoid the depressed palate induced by a second Heineken or mediocre Merlot, stop by this bar. The cocktails are inventive and meticulously made. Last night, I realized that this place has become one of my staples when I am in the mood for a good cocktail and bar snacks that are more complex, tasty, and filling than spiced nuts and marinated olives. I tend to frequent their late night happy hour. If you live in the area, stop in from 10p-midnight for reduced cocktails and half-price bar menu with selections spanning a burger with quail egg to masala calamari (the Yakitory--shrimp, beef, and chicken with three tasty condiments--is a steal). If you are a gin person, the range of innovative g-based cocktails will delight you. The cardamom pods in the Indian Summer bring me back to Zanzibar; my girlfriend loves the Grapefruit Vesper. I am decidedly not a tequila person (blame it on waking up to a weird guy serenading me with his guitar following a tequila-soaked Cancun evening), but on Cinco de Mayo the friendly bar-tender convinced me to sample the Nectar Margarita (made with agave nectar) and I ended up ordering a second. 

All of the bar tenders I've met are skilled and never sloppy, even on busy nights. I am a sucker for the electro-lounge music backdrop to quiet conversations all around. The crowd is a mix of 30-somethings and hotel guests sitting alone. Bring a book if *you* go alone and want to avoid chatting with lonely businesspeople nursing a third drink. 

Worth a try if you are wandering around looking for a quality (and reasonably priced) cocktail. Less likely to be packed on weekend nights, too. Some of the best drinks in the Rittenhouse vicinity. I would think it would be a great place to meet up for a first date or OKCupid adventure, though I am out of that game.",2011-05-06 16:12:22,"{'food': ['burger with quail egg', 'masala calamari'], 'drink': ['Indian Summer', 'Grapefruit Vesper', 'Nectar Margarita']}"

I was really looking forward to it. The menu changed slightly so what I wanted was no longer available, but that was okay with me. I started off with the matzo ball soup. It was so scalding hot I couldn't even eat it. While waiting for it to cool, I shared some Caesar salad with my husband. The lettuce was overly chopped and slightly bitter.  There was hardly any dressing on it and had little taste. I went back to my soup and it was still absurdly hot. I asked for ice and put some in. When I got to taste it, it was a huge letdown. The matzo balls were complete mush, no flavor and it had a vegetable broth instead of chicken (which is typically the norm.) For dinner, I had the Maryland crab cake that came with shoe string fries and coleslaw. It was delicious but I was disappointed there was only one. Fries were good and cole slaw was fantastic but I was again disappointed in the serving size. I got about 3 forkfuls of slaw and that's all. Dessert was another let down. I ordered the peanut butter cup brownie sundae. The brownie was a bitter dark chocolate, and the peanut butter cups had an awfully fake taste. The ice cream was practically non-existent and it was mostly whipped cream covering the entire dish.  My husband has the bacon cheeseburger for dinner. He loved it and it was enormous. He had vanilla ice cream for dessert that was no lie, the size of a golf ball
I also ordered the special drink- pink grapefruit margarita, that had zero pink grapefruit taste. It tasted like a regular margarita. I had two because it was still a good margarita but trust me, there wasn't even a hint of pink grapefruit in it. Our entire meal cost us $97. I do not think we will be back.

As you walk in, the beautiful hostesses gain your attention with a smile, and if you're lucky, walk you to your table without that much of a wait.

This place is huge, so huge you just have to see it to believe it. 

Chickie's is perfect on game nights for a great atmosphere. Be mindful of when games start and end if they're being played across the street. Chickie's gets mobbed during these times, so good luck getting a quick table. 

The waitresses are babes, and by babes, I mean the typical fake hotties from the Northeast or South Philly. Back tattoos, booty pants, and enough fake breasts to get Pamela Anderson jealous.

Now for my recommendations:

Chickie's is known for their crab fries. These are french fries covered in old bay and other seasonings. They're really good, and it's pretty much a prerequisite to order them.

Now for the seafood. I HIGHLY recommend the mussels. You get a HUGEEEEE plate of very large mussels in red or white sauce. I recommend the red but the white is delicious too. You could easily eat this as a meal, but I eat it as an app.

For dinner I generally get the hardshell crabs. Hope you're ready to get messy! You get 3-4 crabs in a garlicky seasoned sauce that is delicious. You need to crack, rip, and suck to get the meat out of them. It's a lot of work, but the end result is worth it.

If you're the lazy type, or just not in the mood to work that night, I recommend either the roast pork or the cheesesteak.

I thought the bowls were great.  Really filling and the ingredients all seemed very fresh. I got salad because I didn't see the couscous option at first (I think they've changed the menu boards because I notice an older picture posted on yelp), but I stole a bite of my boyfriend's couscous base and liked that as well.  I got three sauces, all of which added their own zip to my bowl.  I'm not even certain which ones I ended up with as I just pointed and addressed them by color, but they were all tasty.  It would be helpful if they were labeled behind the counter so you could associate them with the names on the menu.

Each bowl comes with a pita on the side.  Ours were both warm and fluffy.  Great piece of the meal.

The lentil soup was good.  I'm used to lentil soups with a heavier hand on the spices, but I enjoyed this lighter version.  We could not finish it with all the food we ordered though.

Baklava was really delicious and not too syrupy nor sweet. I'm glad my boyfriend steered us away from my original choice of the salted caramel.  We ended up with the walnut/pistachio instead.  It was delicious!

I didn't really want the fries after seeing how they looked more chip-like in the cooking area, but I was pleasantly surprised upon tasting them.  The texture was a really good balance between crispy in some spots and softer in others.  Definitely closer to fries than potato chips, despite my hesitations based on the shape alone.

If you are dining with another person and both ordering bowls, I would recommend only one person utilizing the ""Naf it Up"" option as two bowls, two pitas, and two sides is a lot of food.  However, I did like trying more menu items this way.

Most of the tables had reservation tags on them. Since there was only 3 tables taken at that time, we were seated. I wanted to hear Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg's preconcert talk at 7, so I wanted a place nearby. We did make it to the talk on time. (and she was worth hearing talk as well as play)

I've uploaded a few photos. We had the green curry with chicken and ""the king and I"". The green curry is good. Two things to point out though. Whenever you see a menu where you can choose the meat - here you can add chicken, beef, shrimp, duck, salmon, seafood or none - you know that it has not been cooked in the curry. This chicken was not dry as is the usual case with such menus. The other thing that would have improved it is the addition of fresh kaffir lime leaves. Otherwise, the curry is better than the low end Maesri canned paste curries you find in mediocre Thai food places.

The Kind and I came with shrimp and chicken. The sauce was Prik Khing - a gingery paste - without coconut milk like a curry. It tasted like the shrimp and chicken were cooked in the sauce. It was good.

I've had Thai food all over the world, including Thailand. This place does not rank among the best. But locally it is among the best.

The space is indeed small and the tables are close together. By the time we left (6:45 or so) it was fairly full. The crowd was mostly composed of concert goers.

I had heard good things, but this was my first time actually eating here. I had spanakopita with a side of falafel and I almost licked my plate clean and probably would have if everyone's head had turned for a second. Even the mini side of greens that came with my entree was seasoned amazingly. I'm not even sure what all of the ingredients were that I was eating to be honest, but I dug in to everything and I'm still fantasizing about it. The flavors all worked so well together. No extra seasoning or condiments were available/offered, but none were necessary. And trust me, I typically add salt to basically *everything* that I stuff down my gullet. 

The service was great as well. The hostess was very friendly as was our waiter--he was just the right amount of attentive and seemed to have a great sense of humor. 

And the price--holy crap. Amazingly affordable. I've spent more on a single cocktail (including tip) at Center City restaurants and that was essentially my entire bill for a delicious and filling meal here. 

The only negative (and I'm not even really sure that it completely qualifies as a negative, to be honest) in my mind is the fact that it's BYO.

It's never fun to have to pick onions out of your sandwich especially when they're covered in ""special sauce"" and especially when your with someone who you're trying to impress. That said, next time I'll order it without onions entirely to avoid this problem. All in all the Ziggy Burger is definitely a must-try for everyone. I honestly could only eat half of it and it kept me full for several hours. My ""Groothie"" and Ziggy Burger was only $12 making this a reasonable option for those on a budget.
One last thing I love is the fact that you can grab a salad/sandwich here and take it 1/2 block to Rittenhouse Square for a nice picnic in the park. I'll definitely check this place out again if I am in the area and looking to explore more Vegan options.

We also asked for their hot pepper sauce and got a nice tangy sauce of freshly chopped habanero peppers.

As other reviews have mentioned, the best part is that Caribbean hospitality Kevin and Anthony provide.  Not even NYC places could match this.

My friend and I dropped by Sbraga for an early Saturday dinner. Sbraga's brand name is well known for people who love watching Food Network (like myself), so I had high hopes for the restaurant. Upon arrival, my friend and I were promptly seated and were excited to start our meal.

We both started with the Gruyere Popover, which was arguably the best part of the meal! The popover was warm, cheesy, and huge. It's basically comfort food, and I almost wished we were served another one (but decided against asking for it because I knew I had to save some space in my stomach for the other courses). We were also served the foie gras soup, which was creamy and sweet - a great way to stimulate my tastebuds for the great meal ahead.

First course: escargot. It was served in a nice brown butter sauce, complete with a piece of toasted baguette to mop up the sauce. While rich and satisfying in the first bite, it got a little too much and too salty after a few more spoonfuls. 

Next course: Saffron bucatini. I love the little shreds of blue crab interspersed with the pasta, as well as the fresno chilies which added a little spice and sourness to the dish.

Third course: Golden tile fish. I absolutely loved the dish. The fish was mild and well grilled, but the star was the hush puppies that came with the dish. The hush puppies were spicy, and fried such that the exterior was crispy but the interior was still fluffy. If they served it as a side dish, I would definitely get an extra side.

Last course: carrot cake. This was an interesting spin on the typical carrot cake with cream cheese frosting, because Sbraga's version uses goat cheese. The taste was a little strong for my liking, but then again, goat cheese is typically strong, so this depends on your personal preferences.

Overall, Sbraga was extremely value for money. I would say the starters (popover and foie gras soup) were the winners of the dinner, the other dishes were well done but not out of this world.

Unfortunately the bison is a very lean cut, so their adherence to the 160 pork temperature standards does severely hinder the mouth feel and flavor profile of the burger. It came a bit dry though still well seasoned and moderately moist.

They top he bison with a grilled pinneapple, onions, and duck bacon. The pinneapple was only right for this burger because the meat was on the blander side. Otherwise I wouldn't be down for fruit on my burger. 

Their sauces shone: exhibitions of curry and habanero. Great experience there.

Overall, this was a very good burger. The bun was good, though not as chewy as I'd prefer from Brioche

The toppings and sauces, along with high quality ingredients saved Bareburger from a three. Id like to see them step up on execution.",2016-06-03 01:35:04,"{'food': ['burger', 'pinneapple', 'onions', 'duck bacon'], 'drink': ['Lancaster Milk Stout']}"
HvB8GVNwlGvAZp6uIfGXRA,klsXNdAUjRRoI4B-eVp7rg,wUnLSg_GKfEIQ5CQQ770_g,4,3,1,1,"Vetri is hands down the top three restaurant in Philadelphia and I made this statement with 100% confidence. Is the food tasty? Yes. Is it overprice? Maybe. Is it the best Italian restaurant on the east coast? Definitely not. When you want fine dinning without being flashy/pretentious or ""too see and to be seen"", Vetri is your best choice when it comes to the city of brotherly love. 

I have dined at Vetri numerous of times and some of their dishes are outstanding and some of them are just average, but please also consider the fact that my opinions are subject to personal taste. Vetri is my favorite restaurant in Philadelphia because it provides a very intimate and cozy environment and its selection of wine....BAM!! To. Die. For., they knowledgeable sommeliers that is not snobby and doesn't just trying to sell you expensive wine. 

Quintarelli Amarone-  It's hard to find restaurant and stores that sell this bottle due to its relatively small production and high price, people often will just go for french wine if they are going to pay for the same amount anyways. However, this bottle is like..... Magic, OK..... I'm lying, but it is my favorite Italian wine. It's rich, big, bold, flavorful with tannin at the end, it has all the characteristics I like in wine, guy as well maybe? lol, kidding!  

Louisiana white prawn with zolfini beans- the shrimp they use is not particular impressive i.e. not super fresh or different from other restaurants, but its the dish as whole that hold this dish up to the restaurant's standards. Marc Vetri utilized the lightness of seafood and heaviness/creaminess of the bean and sauce, created this dish. 

Squid ink linguine with crab and urchin-  I suppose you should order this dish if you want something light from the restaurant, because most of the dishes they offer are pretty heavy. However, I would not order this dish again because I couldn't even taste the uni in the pasta, then what's the point or ordering uni pasta? 

Sharon fruit salad salad with arugula- don't waste your $ on this dish, trust me on this one.

Cauliflower flan with quail egg- I love this dish!! You can actually taste the cauliflower, and the flan with quail yolk MELTS in your month, very light and delicate dish.
 
Sweet onion crepe with white truffle- a MUST ORDER, this is one of their signature dish and it sure hold its title, it's so rich and creamy. Crepe is fulled with 10,000 caramelized onions and drizzle with white truffle sauce, have it with a few sips of wine, a winner recipe.
  
Spinach gnocchi with brown butter- another MUST ORDER, I remember the first time I saw this dish I thought it was brussel sprouts and it was much smoochy and creamy with I bite into, the cheese, the smell of butter....truly a memorable dish. It is however, extremely rich and fatty and I do not want to most how many sticks of butter are in those little tiny spinach balls.   

Almond tortellini with white truffle- this is suppose to be their signature dish as well, I like it but it did not strike me as.... ""oh! I'm gonna order it again next time I come!"". Tortellini is very tricky, it's very hard to cook it right, you often find it overcook or undertook, I think it's most likely due to the structure of it since its like a dumpling rather a pasta. Vetri sometimes can overcooked it as well, but no excuse because I eat what I pay for, and its certainly not the same price tag as dumplings.

Chestnut fettucini with boar and cocoa- not worth the $$. Keep in mind, you are a customer at Vetri that is about to spend $300 per person, hence you deserve nothing but the best! This is not the worst, but it's not the best, it's a limbo....

Baby goat with freshly stone milled polenta- lack of stickiness/flavor of goat, not worth the $$, combination of baby goat and poplenta didn't make it to the blockbuster of food pron industry.

Bistecca alla fiorentina- in my opinion, this is the one of the few proper Italian meat dish Vetri has to offer. I don't normally order red meat when I come to Vetri, but this is what you should order if your PID (Partner in Dine) wants to try some meat.

I am never a dessert person, therefore I won't make comments on their dessert.  The cheese and cured meat here.... nah.... you should just go to Di Bruno or reading terminal market. 

It is very important to know how to order at Vetri if you want a dinning experience that worth its value, but it has became harder now since they only offer tasting menu these days. Unless you go back a few times, they chief will eventually has a grasp of what you like and what you don't like. I want to give Vetri a 4.5 star but yelp doesn't have this option, the -0.5 star is due to discontinuance of a la carte. I know what they say about tasting menu, but I know what I want and I am not friends with Mr. Food Coma.

Having seen a number of their dishes on social media, I was preparing myself for a great noodle experience. The one hour waiting time was expected since it was a Saturday afternoon, but I quickly started noticing the flaws I was hoping I wouldn't see.  Customers who were seated 15-20 minutes after me were surprisingly served before I was. Not once did the servers offer to refill my drink or even offer to do anything for me. I didn't want to bring race into this review, but I couldn't help notice that the servers were a lot more attentive and helpful to their Caucasian customers even if they were seated after me.  But still, I tried to look past that and tried to make the most out of my first Cheu Noodle Bar experience.  After waiting for almost an hour for a bowl of their spicy crab noodle soup, I was met with extreme disappointment once I started eating. The soup tasted like spicy Italian sausage soup from my local Olive Garden. I even tried my girlfriend's yakisoba and was disgusted.  They fucking put tomatoes and cheese in their yakisoba!? It tasted more like an Alfredo or pasta than a fusion Asian cuisine. Cheu Noodle Bars mission statement is providing their best authentic Asian noodle experience. Well, their dishes are overly salty and lack any kind of flavor whatsoever. They have utterly disgraced the Asian cuisine with their horrible fusion experimentation. The noodles i pop in my microwave are sadly better than the noodles I've tasted at Cheu. By the way, their pork belly buns are overrated. They're way too over cooked and lack seasoning. Overall, Cheu noodle Bar is a joke of a restaurant. It's basically just Olive Garden disguised behind a few Asian ingredients. Save yourself the time and money and find a noodle house in Chinatown.

Now I gotta say, it was just missing that ""oomph"" that makes it fall short of a 4 star hotel in terms of decor.  I just didn't get the ""wow"" factor from it so I'm not surprised we ended up with this hotel when we priced $80 on priceline.

However, I will say that the hotel is in a really great location, very convenient to a lot of places in Philadelphia.

Their downfall was when both my boyfriend and I felt itching sensations on our bodies after spending 20 minutes under the sheets in bed watching tv.  At first I thought it was just me, but when it was the both of us we knew something was up.

I don't care, but that is unacceptable for any hotel - and definitely NOT okay for a so-called 4 star hotel.  They didn't even seem all the concerned when we called in.  They changed rooms for us, after we asked, but they really should have been the ones to offer more than that.

The guac was fresh and very good.  The fish tacos were good as well.  I like the atmosphere and service was attentive enough.  The place is a bit overpriced for what you're getting.

The issue I have with the place is the somewhat questionable attitude that they exhibited when we went there.  But basically, we got there right around the end of happy hour.  We didn't expect to be able to order at happy hour prices/selection so we sat in the restaurant area instead of the bar area.  Then the waiter came over and asked us what we'd like to drink and we ask ""is happy hour still going?"" to which he replied ""yes but only in the bar, you can move over there if you'd like happy hour margaritas"".  That was reasonable enough so we told him we'd move over to a table in the bar area and we'd also take two happy hour margaritas.  He came by our new table a few minutes later and said that happy hour had actually ended so he couldn't bring us the margaritas for the same price anymore.  Meanwhile we're sitting at the table by the window and still looking at the happy hour sign on the sidewalk.  Anyway, we found this to be pretty ridiculous to tell a customer that they can get happy hour if they move but then change it once they do move.  Then the manager came by to explain that the waiter just didn't know that happy hour was over and that he couldn't give us the drinks for the lower price.  Frankly I didn't even care this much about getting a few dollars off of a margarita but being told one thing and then having them do another does bother me.  Finally, about 15 minutes later, the waiter came over to us and said that the manager would make an exception and give us one margarita each at the happy hour price.  Which is what they should have done from the get go.  What I can't believe about this whole ~30 minutes of silliness is that the waiter isn't just empowered to make that decision on the spot and avoid upsetting/annoying customers.  Any restaurant manager would be fine with his decision.  There was a grand total of like $8 on the line -- not exactly a big deal.

My main course was the lobster ravioli.. not bad but the sauce again was thick and not much flavor.. the dessert was subpar.. the bread pudding appeared ore made and over cooked or reheated too many times due to being the end of the night. The chocolate cake was dry and not sweet.. everyone who had the steak had nothing but great compliments.

Upon entering, we were immediately seated despite not having a reservation. My favorite part was the complete lack of menu - the waiter just arrived and told us that we would be enjoying a 7 course meal that was pre-set and simply gave us the choice of lamb or chicken for our main course. I am not a picky eater so I really liked not having to choose and having the opportunity to enjoy what the restaurant thought were their best dishes and this enhanced my experience.

The first dish was my favorite, composed of three different salads and was my favorite part of the meal. The carrots and eggplant were perfectly spiced and I could have eaten the portion meant for 3 people entirely by myself.

The spicy chicken was probably the best chicken I've ever had. I know that sounds like a stark exaggeration but I kid you not - go try it.

The lamb was perfect and fell off the bone, and the spicy sauce that we had served on the side is what made the dish perfect.

I especially enjoyed the ending note - baklava and moroccan mint tea which was delicious and perfectly balanced. Along with this they give us a huge bowl of fruits and let us take it home when we were too full to even touch it.

Since I currently live in NY and my husband's family is from NY as well, we had a lot of out-of-town guests.  The hotel was pretty helpful in the booking period, and the prices were one of the best prices for the type of hotel we were looking for.  They were able to give my mom a hotel room across the hall from the bridal suite (even though she booked last minute) without hesitation.

The hotel is in the heart of the city, so it was convenient location-wise.  You are right by Reading Terminal and a few blocks away from CVS if you accidentally forgot some toiletries.  The hotel is beautiful and many of our guests were impressed.  The bell hops and staff are extremely friendly and courteous. I would give the service 5 stars.  They even gave us great restaurant recommendations for my fiancee and I since we were staying an extra night.

My only issue is that we were unable to book the bridal suite for the night of my actual wedding (just the night before/day of) and we were told that they would move our stuff into our ""wedding night"" suite.  My fiancee and I had separate rooms but they were to move both of our stuff that night, without any issues.  Unfortunately, when we got back to the hotel after our wedding, our stuff was not there.

The staff was apologetic and it was corrected right away, but we ended up getting charged for two nights which was not fun to deal with on our honeymoon.

About his food - you get chicken, falafel, hummus, a grain, and veggie/fruit combo of sorts, with a piece of bread or pita, but he always switches up the variety. His chicken is charcoal-grilled and marinated to perfection, hence why you can smell his cooking from blocks away. If you are a garlic lover, you will be impressed with his falafel. It is SO garlicky and so amazing. I'm not usually a hummus lover, but this hummus is creamy and rich. Here are some of the different components I have been given: grilled grapes, avocado salad, fresh strawberries and bananas, watercress, grilled asparagus, a tomato tahini dipping sauce, a dessert hummus, and a fresh golden beet salad. For grains: cous cous, pasta, rice pilaf, quinoa, buckwheat, or any other type of grain. There wasn't a single dish I was upset with.

I can rave about the food for hours, but I'm equally excited about the value! You get a huge platter (the amount of food usually lasts for 2 reasonably sized meals), with plenty of charcoal-grilled, marinated chicken, some sort of grain (usually pasta or rice), a fruit or vegetable combination of his choice, and a wild card (usually either another fruit or vegetable, a sauce, or something completely different you've never seen before). Sometimes, he serves a drink of his choice with the platter, too. When it's cold out, he also provides free, homemade soup for his shivering customers, which I find to be the most endearing aspect of his customer service. Many other reviews find fault with the quality of customer service here, but I just can't be upset with a cup of soup in the cold, a drink, and a huge plate of for that price, and some entertaining chatter. 

Eat what he gives you and you will not be disappointed. Biggest bang for your buck at just $10.

Ralph's has a good claim in that it has never closed since its founding, has been in the same family, and has moved only once - before the First World War.  In my opinion Ralph's is the oldest Italian restaurant in the United States and as such deserves some respect for its longevity and its traditions.  It is located in the Italian Market section of South Philly and probably doesn't look that different from when it opened.  And many of the menu items are the same too. And don't think it is small - there are three floors of dining!
 
One of my favorite foods at Ralph's is a Philly concoction called Giambotte.  Giambotte is a spinoff from a fritatta with everything but the kitchen sink mixed into it. There's chicken, sausage, three different cheeses, roasted peppers, onions .... you get the idea!  Your generous basket of bread comes fresh from Sarcone's Bakery next door.

We started off with 2 House Margaritas which were absolutely perfect and fresh.  We also ordered the Create your own Guacamole (you select the type of peppers,onions, tomatoes, garlic and cheese you want on a little card and give it to your server) and I must say it was the best Guacamole I've had in a long time. We also had the Huarache de Hongos which is a crispy masa flatbread, seared wild mushrooms, marinated artichokes topped with manchego and cotija cheese... it was INCREDIBLE! So we were two for two so far... onto the entrees. We ordered the Fish tacos and the Pork tacos to share although the server accidentally gave us the Beef tacos so we got to try one of them too. I wasn't super impressed but did eat 3 tacos nonetheless. I think they were fresh and cooked and prepared perfectly but I am just one of those people who love salsa and this is not the place that serves salsa with their tacos. 
I would give Xochitl 4 stars if it were not for the poor attitude of the server, bartender, and hostess.
Example: We had a reservation and the hostess tried to sit us at a High Top table in the bar/waiting area. If I make a reservation I expect to sit ""down"" (not up) in the main dining area. It may just be me but I think it's just part of the guarantee you get when making a reservation ahead of time. Throughout our meal our server was rude, disinterested, and not attentive.

We're both big Top Chef fans and I was thrilled to finally try this place last night as I loved Season 7 and seeing Kevin win. Thankfully, my expectations were met and exceeded. 

First, the space is great. It has an industrial feel with rustic wood paneling. Very pretty. Next, the service was out of this world from the second we walked in to the second we walked out which just made the whole experience even more special. 

In the dining room, they serve a tasting menu (amazingly reasonably priced) which is filled with amazing selections that change seasonally. Additionally, they have a chef's tasting table which is different night to night and overlooks the kitchen. I will absolutely try that out the next time but for this night, we sat in the dining room. 

And now onto the fantastic dishes...
Course 1: 
Foie gras soup: We ordered this because I've read it's Sbraga's signature dish and wow, I can see why. This soup was so complex. With every bite I tasted something new. I would essentially eat this soup every day if i could. 
Pork Belly with chili oil, sea lettuce and cucumber: I love pork belly and so does my boyfriend so we ordered this but to my surprise, it was served cold. I was fascinated by the cold pork belly but it totally worked. The combination of everything in the dish was great. It was rich from the pork but still refreshing and light. 
Course 2:
Octopus with piri, green beans and tapenade: This dish had some heat! Thankfully, I love spicy food but I imagine it would be a problem for some. The octopus was tender and I really enjoyed the spice in this dish. It was not a typical octopus with tapenade dish at all. 
Sea Bream, calamari, ink and pork belly: This dish was well done, but I think I discovered I'm not a big sea bream fan soo, i'd likely avoid this next time. No complaints though.
Course 3:
Parpadelle with rabbitt and bread crumbs: Oh my god. I loved this one. The pasta was perfect. The dish had the perfect amount of richness, cheesiness and crunchiness. Every bite was better than the last. 
Venison: I'm hazy on what came accompanied with the venison but one thing stood out the most and that was how tender it was. Game can get tough fast and this was not in the slightest. It was also cooked to perfection. Yum
Our waitress then surprised us with their take on a roast pork sandwich. We were close to ordering this but just couldn't see how it could work...we were dead wrong. This was a piece of pork belly with brocoli rabe and a provolone bread pudding. Talk about elevating a classic into something out of this world! 
Course 4: This is in our fridge at the moment. We were just too full to get to it but it absolutely looks great. Apparently I couldn't wait to write my review of this meal. :)

To sum up, I'm already thinking about my next trip to Sbraga. I couldn't have planned a better birthday dinner for my guy thanks to this place.

My six year old nephew was off from school for some unknown occasion, so we decided to go on an adventure. It was my understanding that chicken tickets were given out beginning at 10:45 (which made sense to me since the normal lunch rush is between 11am and 1pm), so we arrived around 10:30, appetites whetted.

Fail. 

Chicken tickets aren't available until 11:45.

I was slightly turned off by the very matter of fact ""chicken's not til 11:45"" response I received, rather than a mildly apologetic & explanatory ""I'm sorry but our chicken isn't ready until noon,"" but I didn't come all that way for nothing (nephew lives in Cheltenham), so, we decided to order donuts.

Double fail.

Federal Donuts are fancy.

I had no prior knowledge of the menu, and came in with visions of some fantastically hefty, ""old fashioned,"" ""authentic"" boston cream doughnut (yes, what i envisioned was a doughnut, not a donut) blessing my mouth and belly, and nephew just wanted a simple chocolate donut.

We sat down to eat our donuts (Appolonia Spice for me, chocolate raspberry for the little one), as I debated in my head whether or not I was willing to wait an hour for the chance to buy chicken.

The decision was made for me, as we were in the way of the people trying to put cream and sugar in their coffee, plus it began to get uncomfortable in the small space as more people trickled in to wait for chicken tickets. (You try hanging out in a silent room full of people with a 6yo.)

Ultimately, I thought my donut was pretty tasty, but after one bite, nephew decided to put his away ""for later."" He never even thought about that donut again, except to decline it when I offered it as an afternoon snack. I can't offer an opinion because I am repulsed by all things raspberry and didn't taste it.

As much as I wanted to love Federal Donuts, and wanted to adore the experience, the highlight of the day was nephew's excitement at seeing the NBCPhiladelphia van outside because we arrived as the Ten Show was wrapping.

We arrived at Honey's at around 11am. There was, as expected, a line. It wasn't a big deal. It was gorgeous and sunny outside, there were benches (well, planters with wide edges), and the hostess lowballed the expected time, so we were pleasantly surprised to only wait half the time she stated. Our table was squeezed in between two others, but the noisiness of the place actually provided more privacy than if it had been silent. We set about reading the menu. It was extensive and slightly confusing (they provide you will all the menus, including dinner, although many of the dishes on it can't be ordered before 5pm), but it had a lot of tantalizing options. Pear-Nutella french toast? Brisket sandwich? Chorizo desayuno? I wished I was in a bigger group of people so I could sample more dishes. 

I ordered the chicken-fried steak and eggs, while my friend got the Breakfast Bomb, which is advertised as ""a buttermilk pancake stuffed with scrambled eggs and your choice of breakfast meat"". We cracked our beers (BYOB) and settled in for a good long wait. And I mean looong. Boy howdy. That food took nearly an hour. 

In the end, the eggs were delicious but the chicken-fried steak was a sad disappointment. I didn't eat more than a couple of bites, as it was overcooked, soggy, and almost totally unseasoned. The Breakfast Bomb was a good choice, though--I tried that and I highly approve. Like a McGriddle but made out of real food.

A nice bar scene, lots of guests from the attached Hotel Monaco. Bar staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about both food and drink. I had a happy hour classic old fashioned which was made with wild turkey 101. It was a pretty good drink and when priced at $6 is even better! 

For dinner I decided to order the sausage of the day, pork confit and potato gratin. The sausage of the day was a Vietnamese sausage with spices and fennel served with mustard greens and a white bean puree. While I didn't care for the white bean puree the mustard greens were fantastic as was the sausage. I wish it had a little more crunch on the casing, but I think that's a personal preference. I had another old fashioned, can't turn them down at $6 did I say that already?

The pork confit and potato gratin came out next and the first two things I noticed (sadly negative) were a) the size of the gratin, it wasn't more than a 1.5x1.5"" square, would've expected more for $7, given the prices on the menu and the dishes, b) the ridiculous amount of butter on the pork confit. I can't figure out if the dish is normally served like this or this was just a one off, I have to think it's always served like this. Literally there was so much butter that it was 1/2"" in the bottom of the bowl. I ate most of the pork, which soaked up the butter decently but the noddles were amazingly oily and really not edible. I'd love to hear that this was a mistake but I fear it wasn't. The gratin suffered from the exact opposite issue. It was dry, had no cheese taste to it, honestly tasted like a Betty Crocker home bake with a little salt.

I decided to skip dessert in favor of a glass of scotch from their excellent whiskey collection of bourbons, single malt and blended scotches, all priced reasonably. I had a Glenmorangie Quinta Rubin which was priced accordingly and had a generous pour.

Overall, I think these guys have some great things with the house made sausages and great cocktails on the menu, but the main and side I had just weren't too great. I saw others next to me get the chicken pot pie, sirlion filet and hummus and all seemed to be pleased.

We made reservations for 9 pm, although when we arrived on a Friday night, we realized we didn't really need them. 

We were seated at one of the small tables, in the middle of the restaurant. The dining room is pretty narrow, which I found out when the servers kept knocking my coat off of my chair. It would have been nice if they had offered to hang it somewhere or put it on a nearby table. 

Two waiters kind of, sort of, waited on us. Honestly it was confusing and kind of a pain. I ordered a beer from a brewery in my hometown called Voodoo. It was their Pilsner. I understand the cost of craft beer but the less than a pint I received for $7 was a little disappointing. My friend ordered their Mule and loved it. 

One of the waiters suggested ordering 4-6 plates. Oh, boy. I'm glad we only ordered four in the end! 

We ordered the skillet corn bread, mustard BBQ wings, baked macaroni and cheese, and one of their specials - half a grilled chicken served with coleslaw. 

Skillet corn bread - would definitely order it again and it's not something that I usually order! YUM. Melts in your mouth. Very flavorful. 

Mac and Cheese - nothing special. This was my friend's choice. I don't order mac and cheese at restaurants. And it definitely hadn't been baked. It was just served in a cast iron skillet and the bread crumbs on top might have been toasted in the oven briefly. 

Mustard BBQ wings - YES! ORDER THESE. They were my favorite. Great quality wings. Crispy. Just a little spicy.

Grilled Chicken Special - YUM, YUM. I wish we could have eaten more. It was the last thing to arrive and we were so full because the wings are huge! Served with vinegar based slaw that was a little limp. 

The tables are way too small for the timing of the dishes. We needed more time so that we didn't have plates crowded into each other at the table. I felt like I was going to knock my glass off of the table multiple times. 

Prices were good - besides the mac and cheese. The serving was really small for $9, even though the pasta was unique. The wings were a great value because they were so large and tasty. The cornbread might be a little high too, it's pretty small for $8. Even $7 would make me feel better about ordering it again.

I find that a lot of bakeries overbake nearly everything, and that problem is compounded by the fact that most places let their baked goods sit for way too long before discarding or discounting them. Although I can't speak for how long things stay on the shelves at Swiss Haus, I can say that they do a good job of baking things properly. Their traditionally dry cookies and pastries are a bit on the dry side (though not in a bad way), and the things that should be moist (like brownies or cupcakes) are moist. This alone puts them ahead of 90% of the bakeries I've been to.

I also really liked that Swiss Haus has a good variety of baked goods. My personal favorite is the devil's food cupcake, and there are a lot of great cakes, cookies, and brownies. I took some stuff home to my parents in Illinois on a recent visit, and my dad went nuts over the chocolate peanut butter brownie. This would be the moist stuff, and nearly everything I've sampled has been pretty good.

On the dry end of the spectrum (and oddly enough, the baked goods almost seem to be arranged in order of moistness to dryness, from left to right), there are a number of cookies and pastries to choose from. If you don't like dry cookies, you probably won't like most of what this place has to offer. The only cookie I've eaten here that was moist was the black and white cookie, and it was pretty delicious - especially the white side. The rest are harder, like the kind of cookies someone might eat with their tea or coffee. You can get them individually, or by the pound. I'm guessing the larger cookies might be a bit softer, but I've yet to sample them all.

If you're looking for traditionally Jewish/Eastern European baked goods, you'll find a reasonable selection here. I'm not sure if it varies by when you come in, but I've seen a variety of apple pastries, hamantaschen, and rugelach in their cases. If you're vegan or gluten-free, you'll find a FEW options, but not a ton. It's a bakery, what do you expect? I'm also not sure what their procedures are in terms of avoiding cross-contamination for gluten-free items, so if you have a serious medical need to avoid gluten, you might want to call ahead. 

The only things I don't like about this place are the fact that there aren't more ""fancy"" cookies, especially very moist and soft ones, along with the fact that the staff is very hit or miss in terms of friendliness. Most of my experiences have been great, but there were a couple times I felt like they seriously wanted to shove all the customers out the front door. It's not that they did anything specifically unfriendly, they just seemed rushed and impatient as people were telling them what they wanted from the cases.",2014-09-16 15:43:56,

You want to be hip and helpful, but you sort of belly-flop while other perfectly good dive bars are doing swan-dives into the pool.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I wasn't a huge Skinners fan, but I did like that it offered a late-night, low-key option in Old City.  The first time we went and asked for food, the horn-rimmed glassed server said, ""Get the fuck out of here"" and proceeded to shake his hiply tattooed fist at us.  Call it love.  I like a guy who tells me to get fucked when I'm the one tipping him.  Let's make a deal, boy-o!

Skinners was the type of dive bar you'd go to with your grandpa, if your grandpa were tattooed and used to work in a cool industry like lumber or steel.  Mac's wants to be that, but it also wants to be a college bar.  Hence, the tables and chairs, rather than the lurky booths.  The bartenders all seem angry, but that's part of their charm.  I don't know about you, but man, I want a guy to pour me a weak drink and slam it down in front of me like he's got John Henry's hammer.  

The main complaint, other than the essence of Skinner's being lost is that the drinks are higher priced and weaker.  I'm no lush, despite what my reviews might reveal, but I want a darn strong drink if I'm ordering it at midnight.  I don't want any namby-pamby cocktails with melting ice.  Make it strong and give it to me with a smile and I'll probably tip you like you're a million dollars.  It ain't always sunny at Mac's and that's the reality.

Two of us showed up at 7:30pm and three more, including myself, at 7:40pm and the area we agreed upon was seated with two separate families.

If you live in the area south of Snyder Ave., or what I like to refer to as ""the deep South"" of South Philly, you probably eat an ungodly amount of PIZZA. On just about every corner of every block of this neighborhood, you can stumble into one of many family-owned pizza and sandwich shops. Pizza joints are equally as prevalent in South Philly as our beloved corner bodegas and the word ""youse"". However, if you've already eaten pizza for dinner six times in one week and you are looking to add a bit of variety into your carb-loaded diet, give Hibachi 2 Go a buzz and order your weight in sushi for a fraction of the price of what other Philly sushi restaurants charge.

The first time my husband and I turned our backs on pizza and decided on a sushi feast from Hibachi 2 Go, we ordered four rolls and a salad for a little over $30. Some people may be skeptical of the combined words ""cheap"" and ""sushi"" and the words' ability to coexist without hinting toward possible gastric terror and a one-way ticket to botulism hell. However, we have ordered here five times since discovering this place, and with each order the sushi has been fresh and tasty, and we've lived to tell the tell and write a Yelp review about it.

Every time we wanted to take an elevator down from our room on the 8th floor, we would have to wait several minutes and when the elevator arrived it would be crammed full of people.  Not very pleasant.  They have an annoying set up where half the elevators serve only floors 19-33 and the other half serve the rest - maybe that is why it was so slow.  Whatever the reason, this was extremely annoying.

This was billed as a luxury hotel, but doesn't quite match what you would expect based on the price.  The bathrooms and bath products and view were just OK, the fridge was filled with insanely overpriced items that charges when you touch them and there was no other room in the fridge for storage.  The keurig machine was nice but they should have put more k-cups out for it.  There were only 2 actual coffees there and it comes out in a very small portion.  The bed was too soft for me.  None of these was a big deal at all in themselves, but altogether made just for kind of an average experience.  It was the horrible elevators that really brought the star rating down though.

Do NOT park in their lot - it is outrageously overpriced.  There is a nice lot across the street that charges $17/night.. we came Friday night and left Sunday afternoon and paid $34.

We then followed with fundido (sp?) which  was delicious and the chorizo, potato and kale. . We create our own burritos with all 3!  Truly delish!

Kick it up a few with the nublado or even try a flight!  We had a selection of 3 tequilas to taste test!  Boy I'm glad we had a little appetizer before we tried them!  It was fun!  They went down smooth and yummy!

My favorite menu items here are the fried pickle chips (corn-meal batter gives it a really nice texture), the brisket sandwhich (on buttered texas toast/can sometimes be fatty), and the ribs! The ribs are done in a Texas style, great dry rub, smoked in-house, and no sauce. The bark on these suckers is delicious, smoky, and a little spicy, and the meat falls right off the bone. It was so good, I don't even remember if it came with a side, who cares? 

Also, if you are having a late weeknight, the margaritas are half-price on weekdays after 10PM. That's a pitcher (about 4 glasses) for 10 dollars.

First off, it's a small place, so make reservations. Despite its proximity to Penn/Drexel, seemed to be a fairly middle-aged to older crowd.

Food:
-Southern Hummus: I had just eaten at Zahav the night before, and I knew this wouldn't be as good but I was still intrigued. The bread was warm, crispy, delicious (reminded me of Zingerman's). The hummus was good but did not blow me away...the portion could have been a bit larger (the bowl its served in is deceptively small), and I think it could have benefitted from being slightly warmed beyond room temperature perhaps with some olive oil/seasonings. Maybe this would have made it more Greek/Italian than ""Southern,"" but I think it would have made it better (are the peanuts supposed to make it southern?).
-Oyster Sliders: worthy splurge at $5. Would totally be awesome but not financially feasible to do AYCE with these. My one complaint is that the oysters seemed to individually vary in size. If I returned, I would definitely order another one of these again.
-Baked Mac and Cheese: About what I expected. Very good, served in a pan. However, I felt this was just M&C with a BBQ seasoning on top. Again, the M&C was very good, but it wasn't really all that unique/special/Southern. 
-Fried Whitefish: served over a bed of chopped vegetables that actually very nicely complemented the whitefish. 
-Grilled Asparagus: one of the more reasonably priced dishes at $6. Came with a nice gravy like sauce. Probably the most justifiably ""Southern"" dish I tried.

The individual dishes are pretty small, and the food isn't particularly novel (or for that matter even Southern as much as simply American). They recommend ordering 3 dishes per person which could really add up. I would probably be a bigger fan if the portions were larger. Otherwise, it was all great.

FINAL VERDICT: Very good food and service, but felt overpriced for small portions of simple dishes.  Definitely a nice restaurant if you can afford it, but on a student budget I probably won't return.",2014-09-16 22:33:33,"{'food': ['Southern Hummus', 'Oyster Sliders', 'Baked Mac and Cheese', 'Fried Whitefish', 'Grilled Asparagus'], 'drink': []}"

To preface this, I have eaten at numerous Indonesian places in Queens, NY, and am a big fan of Asian comfort food (doesn't matter if it is Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Malaysian, or anything else I missed!) and have seen too many mediocre bowls of ""noodles"".

Not gonna lie, the area threw me off a bit.  Im not used to having to park a larger car backing into a tiny spot in a cramped street.  I felt like my mirrors were going to become the casualties of the six young kids playing ball up and down the small row.  The area was a little suspect, as we already passed over another place due to its really shady look neighborhood.  I will venture for good food any day, but sometimes instinct tells you to keep moving!

I gotta say, walking in felt like I had grown up down the block.  It just emanated that local, unpretentious, warm feeling that is lost in some of the shiny, new, plasticky restaurants I see so often in North Jersey.  10 or so tables, small staff, a refrigerator filled with desserts, and the familiar smells of the feast to come fill your senses.

We ordered fried wontons, mie komplit (#1 on noodle page), the spicy salted fish entree, and the pork combination (#18 on entrees page).  The wontons were surprisingly thin and flavorful.  Very crunchy, definitely different than the ones you usually get at a corner Chinese spot.  The mie komplit comes with egg noodles, roasted pork, and ground beef amongst some bright greens and fried onions.  You are given a separate bowl with chicken broth and some fish cake/meatballs floating playfully in it.  It's up to you to either douse your noodles into a full on soup or just enough so everything retains its separate and delicious flavors and textures.  I say drop in a little at a time, it really brings everything together in the most wonderful way.  It was warm and delicious!  

The salted fish was exactly as advertised, spicy as all hell!  Dude, these chiles are some demon reincarnate spitting hot fire onto all of your taste buds, at the same time meshing really well with what should be an overly salted piece of fried fish.  They come with some tasty sides, a deep fried or soy sauce marinated egg (both hard boiled and equally worth having), and a substantial portion of rice.  I found it a bit hellfire for my taste but my girlfriend loved it.

The combination pork platter was a trio of swine...sausage slices, pork belly, and roasted pork.  The sweet, salty, and savory combinations were on point, and the accompanying pickles, rice, eggs, and chile-potatoes are enough to leave you full and sated to the point of food coma.  I would eat this and the mie komplit as a glut-lunch with take home for dinner any day of the week.  

We ended up ordering a fried chicken entree, another mie komplit, and rice cake curry to go, as well as two delicious homemade cookie desserts...yeah we may have overdone it a bit.  All in all, one appetizer, six entrees, and two desserts...grand total of under sixty bucks!  All that damn goodness for about 7 bucks a pop!

I so wanted it to be truly wonderful. Northeast Philadelphia has always been sorely lacking in anything that even remotely resembles a creative and eclectic menu and in truth, I honestly believe that's what the Blue Duck is or rather could be. 

Not wanting to take any chances, I made reservations through Yelp but as it turned out, we really didn't need to since it was pretty early and we were seated right away. Our server was bubbly and personable and immediately brought us a bucket with ice and stemless wine glasses for the wine we brought with us. Problem one, how in the world does one carry glasses to a table that are so spotted they boarder on dirty and not notice? The funny thing is, when I was telling my daughter about the incident, she commented that she had experienced the same issue. A little Jet Dry goes a long way for spotless glasses and silverware.

We ordered the Blue Duck fries and they truly do live up the reviews. What could be more delicious and decadent than duck fat and melted gouda? Then throw in some shredded duck and bacon. Worth the calories!

I ordered lobster with a gnocchi shaped pasta and a wonderful tarragon cream sauce. Lobster is a funny thing. Cook it 4 seconds too long and you end up with rubber. This chef knows his way around a lobster because it was cooked perfectly sweet and tender. The pasta was another matter however being somewhat gummy. I would have been happier with linguini or angel hair pasta. 

My husband ordered the amberjack with yellow rice and haricot vert. The rice and green beans were actually heavenly. Soft and flavorful with just enough texture for a great mouth feel. The fish, however, was extremely strong tasting and smelling. There were two nice sized portions but I could only take a small taste. My husband, whom I'm never seen refuse any kind of fish, ate about one quarter of one piece. Personal taste preferences I'm sure.

As we sat talking and drinking our wine, I looked around the room which had suddenly filled up to capacity starting at about 5:30. Some of the other dishes coming out of the kitchen definitely looked worth pursuing. The burgers were huge and looked juicy and the wings look great but my preference will always lean toward the kind of cuisine we haven't been able to get in this part of Philadelphia, a thoughtful and creative eclectic menu.",2015-02-19 20:44:03,"{'food': ['Blue Duck fries', 'Lobster', 'Amberjack', 'Burgers', 'Wings'], 'drink': ['Wine']}"

1. Drinks -  When the beer list is so limited and only offers bottles, you'd assume it'd be well curated but my IPA was pretty meh. 

2. Service - I had a reservation for 3 people and arrived on time with my friend.

Our waiter was helpful only to the degree that the profession requires. He otherwise came off as flippant. 

3. Food - You get tiny plates that are below par and pay a lot of $$$ for this. Among a party of three, the bill came out to $130 for what was essentially a glorified snack.. 

- chicken liver mousse: no detection of chicken liver taste, just salt
- beets: standard
- skate: i don't eat seafood so i didn't try this but my friend reported back that it was also nothing exceptional

I had a second dinner after this meal because I was still hungry but couldn't bring myself to pay for any more extremely overpriced food.

Decided against Pho because I didn't feel like it and already had Cafe Saigon banhmi twice this week already. 

Browsing Panasian Buffet's yelp page showed much props for the sushi section and for $7.99 lunch special, its honestly worth the risk. 

Boy were they right. The quality of fish and extensive selection of rolls came as a surprise. Honestly one of their largest sections. The rolls were well made and comparable to sushi joints in the northeast and much better than typical Chinese buffet's half ass attempt at including Japanese fare.

Downsides are really the parking, really small lot that gets packed quickly and only small selection of Chinese food of average quality as well as a weak HVAC system, really froze my ass off today while eating.  Maybe they want you to leave quicker?

Bottom line, for basically the price of one roll at a Japanese place you can have a full selection already made.",2014-01-07 19:42:18,"{'food': ['sushi', 'rolls'], 'drink': []}"

They start you off with a pot of tea and ice water, which is always nice. We started with the roti canai, and the thin ""pancake"" was delicious when dipped in the curry chicken potato sauce. Beware, however, because we did spot a few tiny bones in the dip that would have been easy to miss.

Then we shared the satay chicken skewers, which have this nice charcoal flavor and are served with a great peanut sauce. I would have been hard-pressed to choose which of these two sauces was better, but man was the peanut sauce tasty.

For our entree we shared the mango chicken, which was the least impressive thing we ordered. The mango sauce was just too sweet and overpowering, and you can tell this is a dish that is less meant for authenticity and more meant to cater to the American palette.

Unless you're Jewish or vegetarian, you need to eat one of these.

I had high hopes especially after seeing the goods stewing behind the window.  I had the tounge and tripe sandwiches with hot peppers.  Right away you can tell the goods were not treated with care as most of the meat flavor has been boiled out of the meat before simmering in the sauce.  You end up with bland chunks of meat with a very oily sauce.  The tongue was a complete disaster as all of the mineral, beefy flavor was somehow lost.  To top off the experience the man in the window had an attitude reminiscent of that Seinfeld character, the soup Nazi.

The bartender on during brunch was probably one of the worst I've ever come across. Sat down with friends who had arrived earlier and waited a full 10 minutes before the bartender even acknowledged my presence, and there were exactly TWO OTHER PEOPLE AT THE BAR! When our table was finally ready, it took another ten minutes for the bartender to finally re-appear so we could settle our bar check and take our table. The food was very good, my friends had the 'cheesesteak' and I had the Eggs Cochon, both were very good. Service at the table was acceptable, but the waiter did seem to vanish for long periods of time, an all to common problem at this establishment.

Our server recommended the coconut shrimp, and I'm so glad we took his recommendation.  They were fresh and delicious.  The shrimp are delivered fresh every day and prepared on-site.  No frozen coconut shrimp here!

We ordered homemade ginger brew, which was thick and pulpy with fresh ginger.  It was quite strong and spicy--not for the faint of heart.  If you can't handle a lot of ginger, stick to the bottled ginger soda.

For dinner, I got the escovish fish filet.  It too was hot, peppery, and strong with vinegar.  I hiccuped for a while after the first bite (spicy food does that to me), but it was great.  I've has escoveitched fish before, but this was not as wet.  Just different.  The side dishes of Jamaican cabbage and rice & peas were so good!  Coconut milk in the rice makes all the difference, I think.

My friend got the jerk chicken (dark meat) which was also delicious.  There was a lot of meat on that plate for a leg and thigh combo!  The sauce was thick and tasty, sweet but spicy.

We also shared some 'greens, greens, greens,' and I'm glad we did.  Collards, spinach, and calaloo with coconut milk is a combination made in heaven.  

By the time we finished (yes, we ate it ALL) our generous portions of dinner, we had no room for dessert.  Our server told us they bring the desserts in from Jamaica.

We got bruschetta and calamari for appetizers. The calamari was delicious - it comes sauteed in marinara, and it was perfectly cooked and tender. My only gripe is that I expected more than what we got for $14. For lunch I got the eggplant parm. Portion size was not an issue this time, as I got more than enough to fill me up. It was pretty good, but I felt the marinara sauce was mediocre at best. One person with me got spaghetti and meatballs, which he said was delicious; another got chicken caesar salad and did not like the dressing that came with it.
