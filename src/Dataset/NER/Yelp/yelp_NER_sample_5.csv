We saw the deck area from the trail as well as the parked bike decor on the railings and thought it would be a great place for bikers to grab a drink. We were in for a surprise.

We sat on the deck and started off with some peronni's and a delicious kava infused cocktail. The service was outstanding. Because of the excellent service and menu presentation we decided to order some food. We decided on the Quattro formaggi pizza which is one of the best pizzas I've had in a while. Fresh ingredients and cooked perfectly. Thin crust style.

We were so pleased at the end that we decided to get the pistachio and chocolate cannolis for dessert. They were the best cannolis I have ever had. Highly recommended.

I will definitely be back and I will try the meat and cheese board next time. The group next to us ordered this and they seemed very happy with their order.

We'd been to Vetri a few times in the past, when it was a fabulous, traditional Italian restaurant and it was great then. This is food, wine and service taken to a new level. On both occasions we had the wine pairing and it was spot on perfect with the courses. We started both times with a palate teaser from the chef which promised the joys of what was to come. Unlike most multi course chef's offerings (such as Alinea in Chicago) Vetri actually gives you a choice of dishes within a limited range of beautifully prepared courses. We opted to have the chef choose for us both times so that we could taste what he thought was interesting and so that we could share each other's plates. When I say that this rivals the best restaurants that I've ever been to, it is not an exaggeration. The blend of flavors in each course and plate was magnificent.
In addition, we had the same wait person both times and he paid meticulous attention to us and was friendly and understated. Such a pleasure. Finally, one could actually have a lovely conversation here. It had a pleasant low level vibe without intruding on conversation. For those of us who hate loud restaurants, it was heaven.

It's a nice, much cleaner alternative with slightly better food options than the rest of the Suburban Station trench warfare fried chicken/Mickey D's/pizza hut selections.

With a second DiBrunos', La Scala, Mexican Post, and a Termini Brothers outposts - along with a Jake & Max salad/soup/sandwich deli, Sookhee's produce/juice bar, Frank's Philly's sandwiches,Tokyo Sushi, Under the C seafood/prepared foods - you'd think you'd be able to eat to your heart's content.

If you're ready to drop about 15 buckaroos for a ho-hum lunch (that includes a beverage), I guess you can.  Jake and Max and The Mexican Post are the most affordable of the bunch - but their offerings aren't very appetizing.  The DiBruno's, is just a replica of the one on 18th with a smaller selection.  Tokyo and Under the C are pretty pricey and they too, offer pretty average stuff.  La Scala seems to be the better of the bunch, but only if you're prepared to spend a little more for their gourmet pizza entrées and salads.

Sook Hee's produce is fresh and the juice bar is pretty good.  They've got a nice orange juicer and I like to treat myself every once in a while to a small one at $2.99.  I'd still prefer to get my produce at Sue's (definitely cheaper) on 18th, though - even with the walk.

If the weather is shite and you're stranded in Suburban with nowhere to go, the Market is a good option - it gets pretty crowded during mid-day lunch rush (go before noon or after 1:30), but there are always tables available.  Despite all the glitz though, I don't find it to be any better than what they offer at Liberty Place only two blocks down.",2009-06-09 17:29:21,

Han Dynasty serves semi-authentic Sichuan cuisine. Sichuan cuisine is known for its spicy and numbing flavours, courtesy of the hot peppers and Sichuan peppercorns. Han Dynasty's food is only semi-authentic, because while the food does have those classic Sichuan flavours, they also goo & sugar it up with excessive sugar and starch.

See the grade report for a handy guide to Han Dynasty's dishes: 

A-range dishes are recommended
B+ dishes are solid and are worth a shot, though not outstanding.

~~~ FOOD ~~~ 

A+ (EXCELLENT = 5 stars)

Drinks are good. Nice varied beer selection. Some mixed drinks are better than others; I've enjoyed the Peach Cobbler Sazerac.

~~~ SERVICE ~~~ 
Service in the restaurant is generally helpful, although it's rather uneven and sometimes bizarre.  Recently, I was in a group planning to order the most expensive level of tasting menu available. The waiter recommended the $25 level (the second lowest level), disregarded all attempts to order the more expensive tasting menu, and basically insisted that the $25 level would be fine for us.  Then, they ended up bringing out some pretty bad, unappetizing food (i.e., C-range and below).",2015-04-03 20:02:48,

They have a family-style type of menu with a number of small appetizers, salads, and then about 10 different types of gourmet pizzas.  It was perfect for a business lunch and was an enjoyable interactive meal.  

We started with the meat and cheese plate appetizer (choose your own meats and cheeses off of a selection of pairings) and had the prosciutto, salumi misti, prosecco, and sardo cheese.  The waitress did a fantastic job of explaining what each one's texture and taste would be.  We then all split the arugula and mushroom salad served in a house vinaigrette, followed by two pizzas: the broccoli misti and the prosciutto and arugula.  WOW..what a delicious experience. 

Definitely recommend this place.  Important to note, however, that if you are going all out, things add up and this place gets pricey.  You will also probably need a nap after they roll you out.

We had a big group and my boyfriend and I having been there before for dinner were excited to go back for brunch.  Unfortunately, the reservation was somehow canceled and we had to wait for a table.  I was not happy!   We were told 4 different times it would be 20 more minutes of a wait.  I was not happy with how the host was handling the situation and eventually spoke with the manager.  A hour after our reservation we were seated.  We enjoyed our time but I was still very upset.  However, at the end of the meal Nick came to the table to apologize once again and inform me that he comped the whole meal.  I really appreciated the customer service and his/the restaurants ability to show that we as customers mattered.  Everyone in the group ended up enjoying their food and will come back again.  

My one tip to the restaurant is to implement a policy for how long a group can stay after they have paid and finished.  We witnessed a table stay for over an hour and a half after they were finished their meal and paid.  This is not only a huge turn off to people waiting, but also unfair to the servers.  Unfortunately some customers aren't considerate and that's why many other restaurants have policies that stop this.",2015-01-21 02:25:53,

The waiter was also very attentive and nice, always ready with water and to take orders for beer. There was no particular thing that I can remember, but I just recall thinking at the end of the night ""I liked our waiter"".

Beer selection was fine, not too large of a selection, but at least one of the major styles. The only issue was that the sizes of beers weren't specified on the menu.

Cucina Zapata. No dispute about it - the best food truck in Philly. I could eat here every single day (if only it was closer to Penn!).

The people working at this food truck are consistently friendly and kind, even when they're super busy or facing inclement weather.

It does require somewhat of a commitment to obtain their food though - the lines get very busy and long during peak hours, and they're only open during lunch/afternoon hours. I suppose that's only validates how it is legit. so. good.

We were seated after a few minutes and given menus. We then watched the two servers walk by several times and have a disagreement with a patron. 

A table of two ladies sat patiently for several minutes and tried to paid cash but was told they did not have any change. They had to rush back to lunch after waiting to pay and then being told they did not have any change prompted their exit without paying the full tab.

At this point, a few other tables had cleared out so they were not busy.. though it still took what felt like an eternity to get water and order.

I waited to hear what others were saying. I read reviews, talked to friends who had been in the past, all comments were coming back positive.
Last night, on the occasion of my forty first birthday, I decided it was time to check it out for myself.

We arrived early, our reservation was for 8pm, but we were seated immediately.
We were seated right inside the door which was uncomfortably cold, but that isn't the fault of the staff or the establishment.

Our server immediately brought over a bowl of roasted chickpeas and pistachios which blew my mind. So much so that I'll be making them at home today to take to a Superbowl party tomorrow.

We ordered drinks, the beer selection wasn't great, but it had enough to satisfy. I ordered a caraffe of Bianco. Unusual for me, but it was quite good.

We started with an order of Crispy Artichokes from the Antipasti menu. They were piping hot and just bursting with flavor. The lemon yogurt that they were served over complemented them perfectly.
For our pasta course we shared the Pappardelle, Gnocchi and the Fiondette. All of which were very good, but the Gnocchi was the true standout here. I can truly see that it will wake me up at night, calling to me, begging me to come have it again and again.
We also ordered a pizza. I had a boss once who preached the word of Potato Pizza. He swore that on his many trips to Italy that potato pizza was a true Italian pizza.
I found this very strange, because the idea of a starch on a starch just seemed so redundant. Bullocks to that!
The Potato and Fontina pizza was just delicious. There is no other word to describe its absolute perfection. The crust was more like a freshly made Mediterranean style flatbread than a crust. Crispy, light and airy yet chewy all at the same time.
The toppings almost tasted like a twist on Au Grating potatoes. Sliced paper thin, peppered with prosciutto, leeks and fontina cheese. There was a balance there that I've only ever noticed in Thai food before.
A balance between earthy, salty, sweet and spicy all at the same time.
Each bite was a trip to heaven.

For desert we order the cannoli and the zeppole. Both were okay, not really epic, but okay.

All in all, I'd say In Riva is a win for the East Falls neighborhood, and a great place.
The portions appeared small for the price, but the quality was outstanding. Since I mentioned price, I have to ad that I don't think it was overpriced, I'm just not used to getting actual portion sized portions at a restaurant. They were the perfect size. Enough to be satiated, but not stuffed.",2013-02-02 15:40:43,"{'food': ['Crispy Artichokes', 'Pappardelle', 'Gnocchi', 'Fiondette', 'Potato and Fontina pizza'], 'drink': ['Bianco']}"

As we walked in, they were putting up a sign saying that for students with a government issued ID; food was 10% off. I of course just happened to have my campus ID card and they were only too happy to let me use it. Then came the menu. It's a bit sparse, but that's really what makes the food so affordable and good; it allows for the chef to prepare a dish quickly and to the best of his ability; as well as cut down on excess expenses to keep countless different ingredients in stock. Subsequently, the cost of the food is unreal, it's less than 6 dollars for a full cut of chicken Katsu, which for us came out in a matter of minutes. Not only was it speedy though, but there was just so much of it! The bowl that the ramen came in was huge; and compared to the costs of other nearby restaurants, would have easily cost 15 instead of 10. Overall, I was very happy with the wonderful, bubbly service as well as the quality, cost, and quantity provided ^_^

Being in town for a trade show, I went there today for lunch. I ordered two of my favorites: clay pot noodles and ipoh bean sprouts. The clay pot noodles is a big clay bowl of egg noodles, various veggies, calamari, pork, shrimp and eggs in a yummy sauce - somewhere half way between a broth and a gravy. It arrives still simmering at your table so do not touch the pot!! Today, the noodles seemed somewhat undercooked but overall the dish was pretty good. The bean sprouts though were phenomenal as always - perfectly blanched (not soggy or raw) in the special house sauce (a variation of a soy based sauce).

My other old favorites are the mango chicken, which is sweet and somewhat spicy and comes served in the mango shells, and the beef rendang, a curried beef dish where the beef is nice and tender and the sauce is pretty dry. I've also tasted the beef chow fun and it was nice and dry (I don't like gravy gook). My boyfriend loves their cracked pepper crab too...

They have several locations, mainly in Manhattan, but this one in Philly has one of the better menus - they vary. I have yet to try the Penang in Boston, but would love to when the chance arises. Once again, they ONLY take CASH and do not speak good English. You also cannot make reservations and the lines can get crazy sometimes - definitely not a place for a quick dinner meal. I mean, they are VERY quick once you sit down and order - in fact, sometimes I feel a bit rushed, but the wait can be daunting...

So, overall I like Penang and I'd recommend it for a fun meal - especially as a group so you can try a lot of different things. The two reasons why they lost the 5th star is that they don't take credit cards, the service is often rushed and this one older waiter (who I think is one of the managers/owners cause he's been there since the first time I ate there about 8 years ago) is SO rude and unhappy. If he ends up serving me, I always feel totally unwelcome.",2006-08-07 21:17:04,"{'food': ['clay pot noodles', 'mango chicken', 'beef rendang', 'cracked pepper crab'], 'drink': []}"
FSrMuCtHqkavYT72k4PswA,xGkWVo7QR405bOWauC-rHQ,5iuo1kvv0XZMS0bUOoLz2Q,1,3,1,1,"Full disclaimer: This is the very first time I've felt the compulsion to write a review regarding a restaurant experience. I came here with my girlfriend the day before Valentine's Day on a trip to Philadelphia from New York City, with a reservation. 

Cutting to the chase, the cost of this dining experience was extremely inflated. We payed Michelin star prices for a meal experience reminiscent of a $40 dollar NYC midtown theatre pre-fixe, which is a generous comparison.

1. After ordering our food, the waiter never once checked on its preparation or how we were enjoying it. We poured our own wine for the duration of the meal. Again, no big deal, but at $120 per person, I like to expect some degree of attentive service. This felt more like a service at a cheap all-inclusive resort.

2. We waited 45 minutes for our entree, which was mediocre at best. The restaurant is extremely understaffed and it shows painfully. Interestingly enough, we received two desserts consecutively, only to have the second taken from our table when they realized they had over-served. (The exorbitant price - $68 per person - only gets you and your partner a shared mousse and grape-sized portion of sorbet.) There is no organization here - no sense of professionalism from the staff.

3. Returning to the crux of my complaint, the value of this meal is simply non-existent. This is faux-fine dining. For a shot glass of soup, two minuscule courses, and a shared dessert, you will pay an arm and a leg. If you are willing to look past the racket they are running at Bistro St. Tropez, then you will enjoy your time here. Coming from Manhattan, I am used to paying a premium on dining, especially during holidays. At the risk of sounding like a snob, I've spent three-times what I've spent per person on this meal and felt satisfied. Here, I felt robbed.

4. The environment does not make up for the value. The restaurant is located in what is essentially the fourth floor abandoned construction site The dining quarters are cramped and the decor is outdated and uninspired. Only a neon sign on the other side of the restaurant provided any semblance of ambience. Expect to be packed into tables like sardines.

Ultimately, we left feeling dissatisfied, hungry, and taken advantage of. After a post meal discussion, we learned other diners felt similarly, confessing to us that they were heading to grab take-out Chinese food after their meal. Not the best way to spend a holiday weekend, nor to blow hard-earned money.

I'm a vegetarian, but don't let that stop you from taking me seriously.  The vegan/vegetarian food here is superb.  Most of it is based on New Orleans style food.  Since New Orleans is my second favorite food city (second only to Philly, of course) I'm always excited to eat at Khyber.  They always have a lot of po' boys to choose from, and usually two or three vegetarian or vegan versions.  They do the faux meat thing perfectly.  And yes, I love well-prepared faux meat dishes that taste as close to the real thing as possible.  I understand if that makes no sense to you, but just because I went vegetarian doesn't mean I don't appreciate what meat tastes like.  And if you can slaughter less animals while still imitating the taste?  Go for it.  If you're like me then you'll love Khyber.

The quality of food is top notch in an intimate, authentic old style restaurant. Will probably echo many of the other reviewers here, but stick with this simple statement: Bar none, one of the best dining experiences for Italian food in the Northeast, not just Philly.

Atmosphere - Ralph's is the oldest Italian restaurant still in existence in the United States. This is mentioned on the honorary plaque outside even before going in. The perfect balance of cozy and legendary, Ralph's decor and pictures show a timeless tradition of outstanding food and family pride. Tightly packed tables adorn the 1st of 3 floors, and the smells of the delicious cuisine permeate the air when you walk in.

Waitstaff - Our waitress was a traditional South Philly waitress, part attitude, part customer service, overall, exactly what you'd expect and want when dining here. Just added to the great food and wine, along with runners to bring out food, and crisp bread from the bakery just next door.

Food - Oh the glorious experience! Feasting on Italian since I was little, going out to try someone else's can really have a high bar to clear, and Ralph's set the new world record! From the delicious mussels in red gravy (get extra bread to dip in), to my heaping portion of lasagna, to the expertly packed meatballs, Ralph's had it all. Add on to that a slice of cannoli cake to split at the end of the meal and just made everything a home run in my book.

Intangibles - Restaurant has no lot, so valet is recommended on weekends. Closest garage parking is about 3 blocks up on South Street. Reservations should be made in all instances, as seating can be at a premium, saw a line out the door during our meals. Wine list is a little pricy, but well worth it for a party of 3 or more.

Overall - Ralph's is worth the high praise and affection, and is definitely a spot to check out on a foodie trip to Philly.

The staff was friendly but tables were high, small and cramped. They sat the three of us at a table that was clearly for two. We nearly  got up and left but were lured by the  sight of the burgers at a table beside ours. 

One glance at the menu and we were hooked. We started off with the house made cheese puffs and the fried shrimp. Both were very scrumptious. And you wouldn't expect fried shrimp to be so tender and juicy. We skipped the pickle selection and I regret it. I took a picture of the pickles at a near by table just to remind me to order it next time I'm there.

For our main course we shared the bbq pork sammy with cole slaw on tender bun. Oh my gosh, it was beyond perfection. Tender pulled pork embraced in tangy homemade bbq sauce. 

We also shared the Whiskey King - 8oz of juicy, seriously juicy medium rare burger, topped with applewood bacon, rogue blue cheese, maple bourbon glaze cipollini and a slab of perfectly seared foie gras. One second for me to regroup after remembering this epic mouthful.

Doing so is admittedly difficult given the uniform quality of pizzas slung around the city, including those from the ovens of old standbys such as Stella and newcomers including Vetri's namesake pizzeria. One must, it seems, venture beyond the pie into new territory to leave an impression on a pizza-jaded palette.

Capofitto, I'm happy to find, does just that. I need not wax extensively about the pies. Rating them as equals to the aforementioned establishments' should paint sufficiently vivid pictures of leopard-spotted, chewy crusts with appreciable oven spring and carefully conceived combinations of quality toppings. Rather, I'll give a shout out to the two excellent pies I sampled: the Genovese (tender, smoky eggplant paired with earthy roasted basil and vibrant tomato) and the Carciofi e Guanciale (deeply porcine cured jowl paired smartly with meaty artichokes and the punch of vibrant olive oil).

How Capofitto truly captivates, however, is through its other offerings, namely their deservedly famous gelato (same folks as Capogiro), non pizza menu items (check out the paninis on ridiculously good house-baked foccaccia), and indulgent house baked pastries. An oatmeal raisin scone offered the platonic ideal of airy yet buttery texture, a nutella-pistachio roll flaked into indulgent savory-sweet layers, and addictive Italian donut holes served as the perfect foil to robust La Colombe brew (or a beer from their concise yet smart selection of craft taps).

Capofitto shows an immense amount of promise and represents a totally unique concept of cafe-meets-pizzeria. The eclectic yet inviting decor further adds to the experience (check out the gnarly knives made for cutting into crusts).

OK, let's get this out of the way: I HATE THE NAME OF THIS RESTAURANT.

Ignoring the awkward grammar, explicitly alluding to ""farm to table"", ""farm to fork"",  ""snout to tail"", ""slow food"" or whatever in the name of your restaurant is the equivalent of someone painting a giant quote from Alice Waters on the wall of their restaurant.  Gag me with the figurative spoon, please!

That said, I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT!!!

Josh Lawler (ex-Chef de Cuisine at the famous farm-restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns in NY) and his lovely wife Colleen have created another one of what Philly does so much better than any other city in the world: an intimate, casual-yet-classy, food-centric BYOB that will undoubtedly be joining the likes of Blackfish, Bibou, Fond and Matyson on everyone's top 10 lists.  In fact, Chip Roman himself highly recommended this restaurant to us (and having been Josh's roommate at Drexel Culinary, Chip also doesn't pass up a chance to give props in the press to his new competition), so it was only a matter of time before our wine group made a pilgrimage here.  Undoubtedly the first of many...

FF is an intimate, ~30 seat BYOB on Pine Street, with fairly easy parking at a couple of lots within a few minute walk.  Inside, it's quite charmingly appointed and hits the sweet spot between casual and formal, making it the perfect places for an intimate romantic dinner, or a casual get together with friends over a good bottle of wine.  All the tables are square, white cloth 2-tops, but they can be arranged to accommodate various size groups, including our spacious table for 8.  In contrast to many tiny BYOBs, FF is actually quite roomy--they could probably have squeezed a table or two more, and there is plenty of room to carry on a private conversation or fit your wine and glasses on the table (excellent Guy DeGrenne stems from France).  I think I had 6 glasses in front of me, without problem.

FF has an interesting, short, constantly changing menu (depending on what they have in; and not having either a fridge or freezer, this is an absolute necessity!) divided up into 3 courses of increasing size, each having 4-6 choices, plus a special or two.

We decided to make things difficult for the staff and came up with our own tasting menu, having bigger dishes plated into smaller individual portions to share, and changing up the order of things to better match the wines we had brought (I've uploaded photos for all the dishes):

Bread: Warm rolls, supposedly Parker House-style (although they look more like a muffin) with a crispy exterior and delicate interior, were spread with perfect, lightly salted homemade butter.  After Bibou, the best butter in Philly.

First course: Grilled Spanish mackerel, with shaved fennel, warm citrus vinagrette, pine nuts and grainy mustard.  WOW!  Let me repeat this: WOW!!!  The Beet steak gets all the love, but this was the DOTN (dish of the night).  Quite simple to read it, and seemed like a mish-mash of ingredients, but the sum of the parts was knock-your-socks-off.  Each bite was a different experience, citrus one moment, earthy nuts the next.  A lovely match with the SB.

~Preceded by a 1996 Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Champagne Brut La Grande Dame and served with 2009 Merry Edwards Russian River Valley Sauvignon Blanc

Second course: Handmade pappardelle with Wyebrook Farm pork shoulder ragu, fennel seed and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  An nice dish, with a good porky flavor to the ragu.  I would order it again, but this was probably the least notable of our courses.  However, the 3 Corners was an unbelievably great bottle of Pinot, massive leather & smoke on the nose, midway between New World and Burgundy, with a long, long finish (WOTN).

~Served with 2005 J. Rochioli Pinot Noir Three Corners Vineyard & 2005 J. Rochioli Pinot Noir Little Hill

Third course: Josh's signature dish of bloody beet steak, with yogurt, shallots, pan drippings, aged balsamic and amaranth.  Yes, this is worthy of being a signature dish, with a rich, meaty texture and flavor that prompted us to move it back in the lineup and pair it with a couple of Chateauneuf-du-Papes and a cab (I think the latter was the best match).  But, sorry, I still think that mackerel was The Man!

~Served with 2004 Clos de Papes Chateauneuf-du-Pape & 2003 Domaine du Pegau Chateauneuf-du-Pape (didn't catch the bottling) & 2002 Dominus Napanook Red.  The Pegau was a very fine wine with lots of saddle leather and barnyardy hay on the nose.

Fourth course: Rare New York venison with farmer's cheese spaetzel.  This was apparently a entree special for which there were only two plates left, so we split a slice each.  Perfectly tender, perfectly rare, on crispy/chewy spaetzel.

~Served with more of the 3 reds above.

T ordered the Ginger Scallion Dumplings and I the Jasmine Rice Salad.  The dumplings were very hot but evidently delightful and my salad was fresh and had perfectly pan seared tofu and a delicious curry peanut dressing.

For main entrees, T ordered the Jatujak stir-fry and I the Panang Curry with tofu.  WE were both slightly concerned about the portion sizes because they looked rather small.

Being that standard American only reaching so far within his comfort zone, I always go for the General Tso's, which is really great at Empress. The combination dinners on the back page offer this dish and many more with your choice of soup and rice for a very reasonable price (a little under $11). The Chicken and Broccoli and Sweet & Sour Chicken both look really good. As far as Wonton soup is concerned, it's the best I've ever had. 

Down 10th street just past the Friendship Arch sits Empress Garden, in all its simple glory, its dirty windows and plastic table covers - a recent addition that I think they should do away with. I'm sure it makes cleanup easier, but those thick plastic covers are a nuisance, in the way every time you cross your legs, sticky to the touch. Just take it from me, Empress, it's better without. 

That note aside, Chinese food - as well all know - can be hit or miss. It's like Mexican restaurants that way: you'll eat it no matter what, but sometimes you raise an eyebrow as you do so. Also, it's a BYOB, which is a nice touch if you want to grab a bottle of wine or a couple beers beforehand.

I don't know where you live, but it's 2011, and there aren't many places where you can get a filling, delicious meal with salad, soup, an appetizer and dessert for $19.95. EVERYTHING at Casselli's is reasonably priced, especially for a Philadelphia (yes, Roxborough is technically Philadelphia) establishment, and the quantity of food and quality of ingredients.  I write about Philadelphia for a living--food included--and I have to say, thank GOD this place isn't located on Main Street, Manayunk, because it would be packed every day and lose its ""hidden gem"" status in about a week.

And now that I am finished ranting...to the food! It's delicious--rivals any Italian food I've eaten anywhere, and at any price. The paradiso sauce is amazing, and the homemade special raviolis and specials salads have always impressed me. My boyfriend is a huge fan of the seafood pasta and the stuffed steak. We probably go to Caselli's at least once a week, often twice. 

Did I mention that neither me nor my boyfriend is a big fan of Italian food? I normally find it on the bland side, and very traditional. Casselli's shattered all of my stereotypes.

The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because I ordered the stuffed chicken once, and I was not a fan. It was the only ""not good"" meal I've ever had at the place, but I like my meat on the dry side, and the chicken was a little undercooked for me. The people I was with enjoyed it just fine. Also, I have heard the veal with the cream sauce was just okay as well. Stick to the pasta and delish appetizers, and you'll be just fine.

The first day of spring actually. I had just broken up with the guy I had been dating. I was deep in the 5 day slump I am allowed to have after a breakup. I don't believe in feeling bad for myself for more than 5 days. But I was in rare form and feeling bad for myself on that particular day. 

I'm not a big birthday person, and never one to plan something for myself. But when my 2 best friends insisted on taking me out, I wasn't about to decline. And so be it that an evening out with my girlfriends, fun cocktails, and comfort food courtesy of Steven Starr was just what I needed to break my funk! 

There was about a 10 minute wait for a table when we arrived, so we sat down at the bar and ordered drinks. The cocktail list was so fun. We would have liked to try them all, but alas it was a Sunday night. The menu did not disappoint either. It was a creative twist on what would come out of my mom's kitchen. It went perfectly with the decor. The exposed brick and open kitchen made me feel like I was home. My friends ordered sandwiches and I had an entree. We were all pleased with our choices and the portions were large. I would have liked to try dessert because they sounded great, but I was just too full!

My bf gets the all-you-can eat sushi and I ordered a noodle dish.  The first thing out of server's mouth is that there is no sharing or we will be charged a $1.00 per piece.  Ok, I understand.  I felt the WHOLE entire time the wait staff was just watching me.  It was really uncomfortable for me and I just wanted to leave.  

Also, for the all-you-can-eat you can only order a maximum of 20 pieces at one time.  Let's keep in mind a lot of special rolls have 8 pieces and if you order two special rolls that would be 16 rolls.  Then after that, you can't even get a regular roll like a California Roll because that is a 6 piece roll  and with the two special rolls  would give you a total of 22 pieces. So basically, you are two pieces over the limit which is pure bullshit.  You would have to order your next roll when you finish your plate.  They will not let you order more than 20 pieces at one time, so don't even try it because that rule is written in stone.  

The Malaysian noodle dish was a very big portion but the sushi was not so good.  My bf got the all-you-can-eat but he still sneaked some rolls on my plate.

Just the right amount of salt and the dipping sauces (mayo based) were good....but just interfered with the essence of truffle slathered on the fries.

I'm more a Dim Sum person who goes to chinatown a lot during the weekends and sometimes during the weekdays every now and then.

I like the idea that they give you a piece of paper that had printed choices to choose from to order your dim sum. Sometimes eating in chinatown can be a pain as some of the stuff you want gets all taken up because the dim sum ladies goes around but doesn't make it to your table quick enough before everything is gone. On the downside about this is that people who have not eaten Dim Sum before cannot see what their eating before choosing. So at this place you have to kind of know what you want in order to place the order.

The service here was pretty good. The lady definitely welcomes those who doesn't understand Chinese as they can also help you out to choose what to eat if you have questions. I think of the two ladies there can some what speak English.

Keep in mind that the dim sum choices here are very limited as they do not have everything like chinatown does but they do have the popular choices like shrimp dumpling, pork dumpling, beef tripe, pan fried turnip cake (Vietnamese call it bot chien), and chicken feet. There's a few more on the menu as well but those are what I know off the top of my head at the moment.

Marrakesh has a belly dancer on Friday and Saturday nights and that was interesting. One of our group was Egyptian and he said she was quite outstanding. I wouldn't know good belly dancing from bad, so I can't really confirm. The dancing was tasteful and not raunchy.

One other thing of note is that with some Mid Eastern and North African cuisines, silver ware is in absentia. Guests are encouraged to eat with their hands as the custom in Morocco. All adding to a unique and sometimes a slightly messy experience.

The pricing was pretty reasonable, we were a little under $50.00  per person with 2-3  beers each and gratuity included. Marrakesh does have a small beer and limited drink menu.

Not just the pizza (which is scrumptious!), but the pasta dishes, the appetizers, and even the desserts.  The staff are remarkably pleasant, welcoming, and fun too.  This is a great, great place to have a meal.

The longer version: My family of seven, including two infants, was in Philadelphia for the evening and in the mood for good Italian food (primarily pasta), so we gravitated to South Philly.  Unfortunately, we forgot it was a Saturday night, and quickly found ourselves unable to get a seat anywhere.  We initially overlooked Gennaro's because it appeared to just be a pizza place, which wasn't the kind of Italian we were looking for, but as everyone tired of walking around on a cold night, we thought we were settling.  The restaurant was also full, but tired and cold, we agreed to a 45 minute wait.  That's when the owner saw us, had a moment of side chatter with his staff, and then decided to open up a whole other section of the restaurant that was being renovated, just so we could have a place to sit and not have to wait.  He even let us use his office to change diapers.  Despite our hearts being set on pasta, we walked past so many delicious looking and smelling pizzas that we ordered a few small ones for the table.  We also tried the meatballs (phenomenal!) and several of the pasta dishes.  Everything was amazingly great, especially the pasta, which was clearly either imported or homemade (it just had that perfect texture and taste).  Throughout the evening, we were attentively waited on by at least three different staff members, each with a great sense of humor and the most pleasant demeanor.  We were so grateful for their saving us from the cold, that the food didn't even need to be that good for us to have been happy, but how lucky we were that it was!

I had to write this review even after my husband already did, but I wanted to get into a little more detail for anyone who hasn't tried the place and has seen some of the reviews below.

I don't think I have ever had something from Pagoda I did not like. The owner is an absolute sweetheart and her husband is one excellent chef. She was such a doll that I had a Christmas and Valentine's Day present waiting behind the counter for when we came in [she makes little 'goodie baskets' and the such for the regulars].

When we first started going to Pagoda I couldn't get enough of the noodle soups. Then I started trying the dinner selections and they have all been great so far. The portion sizes are large for the amount that they charge and all of the vegetables and livestock and fish are fresh and well prepared. For the vegetarians/vegans out there they offer a good selection of tofu and gluten dishes including a tofu General Tso platter and a delicious black pepper tofu and rice noodle special I can't get enough of. The also have vegetarian soups as well and they can prepare any soup you'd like with vegetable stock instead of chicken stock for anyone watching what they eat or who are just pescetarian. Also, they do not use MSG like all those corner store imitation Chinese Food places!

Some people noted that the service was mediocre but we have never had any complaints. They never try to disturb you while you are eating and time everything perfectly. The place is very clean and there are always beautiful fresh flowers placed throughout the place. It is spacious so even when it is crowded you still have room to place your coat or bag next to you without it disturbing someone else or someone tripping over it.

During the spring and summer they have outdoor seating so you can enjoy a cocktail and a meal under the trees. There are birds nested all throughout the park area and it is particularly peaceful to hear them call while you're eating. I often slip the little sparrows a couple noodle for them to bring back to their nests! =]

Besides what I already mentioned some must haves at Pagoda are the shrimp dumpling noodle, the garden vegetable noodle, salt baked squid, the tofu and seaweed soup, and the garlic string beans.

There is parking usually available along front street for all you drivers and the PPA Parking Lot sits right above them.

Why, with so many great bars and restaurants? Well, I don't eat meat. And I grew up in a city of a few hundred thousand people in the northeast that STILL has no vegetarian, not to mention vegan, restaurants. So all the gushing about cheesesteaks and German food was a little lost on me, especially after living in a place where vegan restaurants were super common, including a local CHAIN of completely plant-based, fast-casual food.

So I was really excited when I discovered Hip City veg was around the corner from my office. However, their menu isn't very extensive. Would it live up to the vegan food I was used to? YES. Absolutely. I believe their menu only contains about a dozen food items (excluding smoothies) because, having been in to pick up a to-go order, it's a very small place. That's fine, they do their food well. 

The first time I went I walked over, ordered, and had my food in less than 10 minutes. I got the Crispy Hip City Ranch and a side of caesar salad. The salad was not that special. I've actually had better vegan caesar dressing and I thought the choice of adding jicama was an odd one. But the crispy plantains, which stood in for a cruton, or even crispy bacon, were delicious. The chicken ranch sandwich? AMAZING. The ""chicken"" had a super crispy batter, and was hot, and JUICY. I thought just veggies and ranch on top would be kind of blah, but their peppercorn ranch dressing was one of the best ranch dressings I've had.

After picking it up, I came back to my building to see a Hip City Veg delivery guy (on a bike) bringing food to another floor. So I tried delivery today. I called during the lunch rush and they said it would be an hour, but it only took 40 minutes. I tried the Ziggy burger, which is a soy patty, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onions and tempeh ""bacon"" with special sauce. It definitely satisfied my burger craving, without the guilt. :) I also tried the sweet potato fries. I was skeptical about the black bean cilantro sauce that they come with, but it was delicious. It was thin like a dressing, not like a black bean dip, and the black beans make it kind of creamy, while the cilantro adds a nice fresh flavor. Perfect with the sweet taste of the fries.

If you are coming here to buy items like cauliflower and pizza, then you appear to have a flawed understanding of why Essene is a valuable place. Don't come here to buy things that you can get elsewhere. Come here to buy the things that you can't get just anywhere --- like local raw honey, Fresh Wave candles, those magnificent raw vegan chocolate tarts, a wide selection of lunch containers and non-toxic food storage items, and organic unbleached lady care products (to name just a few things that I like). Even Whole Foods doesn't sell local, raw honey. I find some of the prices to be quite reasonable, actually, or at least just the same that they are everywhere else. If I have the choice of buying an item at Essene or WF, I will pick Essene any day of the week. And I , for one, find the vibe and atmosphere to be quite friendly. Perfect lighting. Amicable cashiers that aren't trained to be hokey and irritating a la WF. 

Quite frankly, if you're going to complain about the price of cauliflower, just go buy it somewhere else.

The atmosphere was a bit stuffy.  Clearly I see what they are going for in their 'private-steakhouse' setting, but for what you pay, I was looking to be a little more imporessed.  

Perhaps my steak got a little too well-done while I was dipping my fingers in my water?  Perhaps ordering a vodka tonic v. a bottle of wine suggested I have no taste?

This is the closest to real italian pizza as you're going to get statewide. Nice charred crust, loaded with fresh, tasty toppings.
Drinks wise, make sure to get an Aperol Spritz. Aperol and Prosecco, what could be bad right? The wine is OK. I'd honestly prefer a better selection, knowing what Vetri serves at his other establishments, but I understand the point of keeping this place as a in and out Pizzeria. Seems like their focus is more on craft beers, similar to Alla Spina. 
First of all, you must start with a rotolo. Those things are insane! Little bundle of joy filled with mortadella, topped with pistachios. I could eat those as my meal alone. Their pizza specials are usually the best way to go. The most recent time we went we had a pizza with fresh peaches on it that was to die for. 
Make sure you save room for dessert though, because they are phenomenal. You'll have a tough time deciding which one to get, trust me ! (we usually end up ordering them all, and taking them home since we're just too stuffed). The Nutella pizza is awesome! (that basically speaks for itself, its Nutella pizza, people) The Affogato is a must. Espresso with a nice helping of Soft Serve Ice Cream. The Fried Pizza Dough is what gets me every time. Its got citrus fennel sugar on every single bite. MMmmmmm.

Yeah, I'm a little late on the bandwagon after the New York Times has written about this place. Regardless, it was so delicious.

I heard wonderful things, but the tales of long wait times for a table made me stay away.  As luck would have it, my dining companion and I found ourselves free for lunch on a Monday.  Impressively, the restaurant was full around noon and people were waiting by the time we left.  We chose to sit at the counter, just to get a better view of the whole scene.  It's small-ish, quaint and kitschy, but I wouldn't settle for anything less.  Ave was our tattooed hipster-looking server and couldn't have been friendlier or more attentive.  Here's what we ordered, as we wanted to get a good sampling of what all Honey's had to offer.  We shared the Bubby's Brisket Omelet and ordered the cheese & onion latke, biscuit and grits to go with it.  They also have this amazing blueberry preserves which was yummy on the biscuit.  The grits were super creamy and decadent.  Admittedly, I'm not a connoisseur of grits but I thought this bowl of velvet corn mush was fantastic.  Then, we moved on to the Chicken Chili Frito Pie, as seen on the Food Network.  Um, yeah, worth it.  It was a beautiful plate with lettuce, tomato, sour cream and a heaping helping of Fritos with flavorful chicken chili.  I do believe some cheese was melted in there as well.  We rounded our dining experience with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and copious amounts of locally roasted La Colombe coffee.  They brought new meaning to the term, ""bottomless cup,"" as our server was quick to refill at the drop of a hat.  (So very much appreciated.)  Oh, then the grand finale was the Jewish Apple Cake with Pecan Streusel.  This HUGE slice of cake was moist and flavorful.  I mean seriously, this slice was huge.

First off, the decorum is far too kitschy for me. It's corny to the point where it's uncomfortable. There is nothing attractive to me about eating in my weird great-aunt's 1970's apartment. 

More importantly, the food + drink leaves much to be desired. I've had the portobello burger, the ALT (avocado lettuce tomato), and something else that I can't remember. It's all just mediocre. Certainly nothing worth writing home about. Drinks, as others have mentioned, are overpriced and not delicious.

Fortunately, it was. My meal there was fantastic. For starters, the ambiance of the place is really nice. Cool lighting setup, cute little bar at the front of the restaurant, and a big balcony outside that overlooks the Schuylkill and will be great in the spring. 

The meal started with a complimentary dish of toasted (i think?) nuts that was really tasty and a welcome alternative to the usual basket of bread. We ordered the spicy mussels, which came with a nice, buttery, crusty bread for dipping in the sauce. The sauce, while really tasty, was not really spicy -- my only complaint. 

Our main dish was the cippollini pizza: pancetta, brussel sprouts, goat cheese. An absolutely delicious mix of sweet, salty, and spicy. I loved it. The pizza had a nice char from the wood-fired oven but the crust still remained chewy. 

I do think the restaurant is still figuring itself out a bit. We were sitting at a bar overlooking the kitchen, and our server openly admitted to having a rough time serving us in that area. Also, they serve the pizza on top of a big can of tomatoes, which looks cool, but when the guy brought our pizza he said ""watch out, the plate is really hot and unsteady."" Not really the best combo; they might want to rethink that.

I was tempted to order the Honey Cristo again since I liked it so much last time, but decided to try the Breakfast Quesadilla instead. It came stuffed with ham, cheese, and scrambled eggs, with avocado sour cream drizzled on top, and beans and pico de gallo on the side. The bulk of the quesadilla was the scrambled eggs, which I really liked, especially with the avocado sour cream adding a great kick of flavor. Would definitely get this again!

I also tried a little bit of my friend's Breakfast Bomb, which she ordered with chocolate chip pancakes instead of regular. The pancakes wrapped around scrambled eggs and ham were very, very yummy, and the chocolate chips were a great addition.

They also make excellent challah french toast. My other friend couldn't finish her Honey Cristo, so I happily ate the rest of her french toast for her.

In conclusion, a TL;DR list of stuff that Honey's does well:
1) Things with ham and eggs
2) Challah french toast

It was mid-March and still a bit cold, and the small dining room was a bit drafty (they'll definitely need a shelter around the door next winter because when you walk in, you're standing right among the tables).  It's pretty close quarters with nowhere to wait for your table if you're early for your reservation like we are, but the location is great, and we were able to grab a quick drink at Mixto across the street (where customer service is sometimes seriously lacking).  What's good about being in such a small and intimate space is that you get a good look at what everyone's ordering, and everything looked delicious.  You are, however, knocking elbows with adjacent tables and can't exactly have any quiet conversation.  Farm & Fisherman is not the place to go for a quick bite.  I don't know if they're going for the ""slow food"" thing, but there was a long time between courses (filled with rolls and amazing house-made butter).  The food was really outstanding though and one of the best meals I've had in a while.  The farro soup was impossibly smooth with juicy chicken and a bright bite of microgreens - I asked if there was any cream in it because of the consistency, but nope that's just pure vegetable goodness.  We also had the prosciutto wrapped egg and pigs ear salad with pine nuts and lardoons (fabulously crispy and beautifully dressed).

What I like about the food trucks at Drexel is that they are priced to not interfere with students' tight food budget. They are priced not high or low, but definitely cheaper than a lot food vendors that is owned by the school or neighboring stores like Shake Shack, Cozara, and etc. Another thing I like about Cucinas is the friendly staff, creativity, and uniqueness of the food they make for the customers. 

Cucina Zapata features a fusion of Thai and Mexican, such as tacos, burrito, katsu, bubble tea, and much more. The first I recommend is the satay chicken soft tacos (1 for $3, 2 for $6, 3 for $8) because I know they can get me full. The lettuce, the peanut sauce, spicy mayo, chicken, and the soft taco; the combination is amazing and the taste when it enters in your mouth is so satisfying. The second thing I would recommend is the Captain Crunch Tilapia Burrito. I know right..just the name of the food gives you wonder and joy. The tilapia's crunchy coat (Captain Crunch cereal) is the key and what makes this burrito delicious. The third thing is the Chicken Katsu. For just $6, this dish is packed with so much flavor: spicy mayo and siracha. This is definitely a must get!

On top of this, the tea here is a bit better than other popular locations, such as Tea Do and Kung Fu Tea. I love the homemade thai tea or taro tea and definitely recommend others to get this if you love this curiously orange colored tea with bubbles. After ordering these food that Cucina offers, not only it tasted so good consistently, but also I was able to tell about the creativity: it's Cucina's strong suit.

My first times calling I specifically asked if there would be any thing i should know. So they informed me of the $3 corkage fee per bottle/6pack. I was pleased to know in advance so I could let my friends know. Unfortunately, the girl forgot to tell me there was also a $3 per person entertainment fee for the live band. I was informed of this via phone call at 3 hours before i was showing up with my guests. It wasn't a matter of the $3/per head because i am sure my friends wouldn't have cried about it, but more over the principle of it. I am a planner.

In the end the manager called me back and said she would take the corkage off but not the entertainment fee. I found this an acceptable solution and I was back to being excited about trying this place that I walk by every day. 

Unfortunately, while I was there, my experience was pretty much the same as others as far as food and service. 

The food was excellent. 

The service was poor. If someone brought a party of 15-20 people to their establishment, i feel like we could have actually gotten some friendly servers for the amount of money being spent. I honestly feel that this is fixable. They definitely would need to either hire some friendly staff, or re-train.

The gelato isn't quite as good as at Pitango Gelato (our favorite in the DC area) but it's extremely good all the same. Their banana chocolate flavor is particularly excellent! So, based on the gelato, Capogiro gets 4 stars.

But it's rated higher in my estimation because, first, it has lots of seating, inside and out, and free wifi. Ice cream, coffee, and free wifi? If I could marry it, I'd be on my knee in half a second. The more romantic reason for rating it higher, though, is that the place is built on the site of an old Baskin Robbins at which yours truly worked for a summer when I was courting my beloved (my future wife, not Gold Medal Ribbon ice cream...though that rated very high in my affections at the time, too, because I essentially lived on the stuff, being a poorly-paid itinerant).

First, let me say, it's very small, so don't expect a spacious place to dine. Although small, It's a nice looking place, cool atmosphere. The appetizers were DELICIOUS!!! We started with the crab cocktail and a horseraddish dip sauce. The crab was whole jumbo lump crab meat with chives finely chopped and mixed in the cocktail, it was served chilled, of course, and it was enough to intimately share. The short-rib cheddar fries were amazing! The short-rib is pulled and spread over a bed of fries topped with a cheddar cheese like sauce. The fries were crisp and crunchy, the short-rib meat was tender and flavourful. The raw Eastcoast oysters were fresh. They're slightly salty served with cocktail sauce and another sauce (???) it was very good. The drinks were awesome. If you're looking for something fruitier and smooth, try the one legged man. The mint julep was stronger than I expected, you can really taste the whisky and hints of mint. The New York sour is sour on top of sour if you like that sort of thing and the Sansome Street Sangria was pretty good with a hint of fruity wines and, once again, the whisky shines through. The featured item fell short for me. My entree was the Burger w/crab slaw, sunny side egg, applewood bacon, tomato and lettuce. The burger to bun ratio was way off. The bun was way to thick and wide. I must have bit the burger about 3 times before I made a dent in the burger. I was unable to taste any of the ingredients on my burger because the bread was so over-powering and thick. The burger and the toppings were sliding off the bun. I had to eat the toppings separate in order to taste them. Our bill was $144.00. I could've saved $100.00 and ate at Bobby Flays. He has the best burgers that I've ever tasted in my life. People fail to understand that a good burger is about having a nice soft reasonably sized bun with well seasoned good quality beef. The burger and the bun should be the same size. I should be able to comfortable open my mouth and,  with the first bite, taste all of the ingredients and toppings. Some chef's get caught up in the prettiness of the bun and the bigger the burger the better it taste... No! That's not it at all... To be honest. I'd rather have a burger from Nifty Fifty than Village Whisky. But it depends on how you like your burgers and I, frankly, am not impressed by size and glazed over-sized shiny buns.

First off, it is BYOB which is nice, and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  It is also right near the Broad and Oregon stop of SEPTA so you can take the train one stop and you are down at the stadiums, which is nice.  It's maybe a block from the entrance on the other side of the street. Also after 6 PM you can street park for free nearby so if you are going to a game, free parking and just have to pay for the Septa.  The service is fast and smooth and I have tried many different things.  The filet is solid, and the gnocchi is really good, but I recommend getting it not baked because I think it is better that way and the waiter actually told me that too.  Their spaghetti and meatballs are solid and their bread is really good.  The caesar dressing is good and their salad is as well.  They get you in and out at a nice rate, where you usually are not waiting forever but you don't feel rushed either.  It is family owned and run, so it's not a chain and it offers really good food at reasonable prices especially considering it's a BYOB.  The chicken picatta is also solid, I've had that a few times, they give you nice portions too so I've never left the restaurant hungry.

It was pretty cool in fact! We were offered sparkling or ""normal"" water and we chose the latter. 
My husband and I couldn't find a pizza we both desired so we ordered two separate ones: the crudo and the salsiccia.

The environment was really impressive. The views were gorgeous. The sun was setting as our meal progressed, which elevated the ambiance for me in a strong way. The decor was modern and the place looked impeccably clean and polished.

For appetizer, I got the Lobster and Shrimp. The shrimp was cooked exceptionally well and the cocktail sauce that accompanied the two shrimps was the best I've ever had. The lobster, served cold, was paired with some greens and avocado and was really refreshing and tasty.

For the main course, I ordered the Butcher's filet of beef, medium. When it arrived it was overcooked, one piece was well done. My server brought me another one, cooked ""medium rare"" this time (since I asked for another cooked slightly less). This time one of the pieces was rare, which was fine since I gave it to my girlfriend. I understand the cuts of meat were hard to cook evenly due to the shape, but I expected more consistency.

For dessert, I had the warm vanilla cake. It was filled with caramel and was simply decadent. My girlfriend got the Peruvian chocolate mousse, and said she wished she had gotten the vanilla cake.

We ordered a bottle Arbios , a cab sauv, it had an easier finish than a traditional cab and was slightly more mellow. I really enjoyed it.",2016-02-14 05:07:25,

For our party of four -- two newcomers (us) and a pair of regulars -- we negotiated a window seat on the ""short"" side aimed away from nearby intruding skyscrapers. All loved the feast for the eyes.

Service, from a cast of several helpful folks, was outstanding -- almost to the point of swarming -- and we had no trouble parking in the building's indoor garage ($10 if you get your ticket validated when you leave R2L, $16 otherwise). Whether this is the norm, or whether it helped to arrive early (5:30) and be with a couple of regulars, who knows. But we were treated very, very well.

Food is pretty decent for an eatery atop the city. The market salad app, ""prepared simply"" venison loin, and apple pie dessert were all quite good if unremarkable offerings. The lobster macaroni and cheese app was almost as agreeable. On the other hand, raw oysters with caviar were disappointing, and the ""composed plate"" pork ribeye sounded great on paper but in reality was marginal to the point I had a hard time finishing it. (It was ordered medium rare, but medium might have worked better.)

For two, with tip, tax, coffee, bottled water and three glasses of basic wine, the tab came to $275. To put this into perspective, we get better fare at our local Villa Nuova eatery in the burbs for 20% of this, albeit with average service and without the twinkling lights of Philadelphia.

So R2L is entertainment, not a foodie experience. If you wish to relax with a splendid view of our fair city, by all means go to savor the view and service. Just choose your dishes judiciously.

Space was a bit small--I was sitting with my back to a wall, and servers kept squeezing past me.  Our server was helpful, although he never seemed to make eye contact and seemed to close his eyes whenever talking.  Maybe that's how Cypriots are and he was just trying to give us a more authentic experience?

We got the Greek salad, dips of the day, bureki, and halloumi for appetizers.  The salad was moderately sized and pretty standard.  (I think the one at Dmitri's is a better value.)  I'm not entirely sure what the dips were, but I believe there was a lentil one, a chickpea/anchovy one, and a pumpkin one.  We all disagreed about which one we liked best, but we thought all of them were good.  We had to ask for more pita for dipping, which they didn't charge for.  The bureki (fillo pastry stuffed with feta and thyme, drizzled with thyme honey, served with roast beets ) had a nice sweet/salty thing going on, and I liked the herbaceousness, but it was a bit small to share 5 ways.  It seemed expensive for the size, but maybe that's also because we were splitting it.  The beets seemed a bit like an afterthought.  The halloumi was interesting--I didn't realize that it doesn't really melt.  Again, not the best appetizer to split.  Of the apps, dips of the day was the winner.  

One additional note--they brought out bread with tahini, and I feel like the timing was off--either they brought it just before or at the same time as the rest of the appetizers, or a refill was slow.  Also, nobody poured our wine for us, and we wound up pouring our own.  Neither really bothered us, but I like to nitpick.

For entrees, we got two veal flank steaks, a pork chop, a quail, and a duck leg.  I had the veal.  All the meat was well-cooked, well-seasoned and amply portioned, and the accompaniments were well-executed also.  I'm hesitant to say it, because everyone was happy with their food, but I think most of us agreed that the mains were still somewhat unremarkable; maybe they lacked some defining Greekness that we were expecting.  I'd never had quail, so I did enjoy the richness, and people who tried the duck really liked it (the piece I tried was really too small to get much duckiness).

For dessert, we got the date and chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce, the galatoboureko (filo pastry with semolina custard), and the assortment of Cypriot pastries.  The chocolate cake was amazing--extremely moist, chocolatey, with a faint trace of date flavor.  The vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce weren't the most imaginative things, but they were good and worked well with the cake.  I really enjoyed the custard as well--it reminded me of creme brulee, almost, with a thick, rich texture and fairly subtle flavor.  The pastries had baklava, which was really good--it had cinnamon in it, which made it stand out from other baklava I've had.  There were also almond cookies, which were okay, but not too exciting, and some sort of cake that was sort of dense/dry and not as sweet as I would've liked it.

As we were leaving, we were preparing to stuff a bottle of wine we wound up not opening in a purse, and a server (not ours) stopped me and gave me a...fabric wine tote?  I don't know what it's called, but he said that people are always leaving them at the restaurant and we could have this so our chilled wine wouldn't warm up on the way home.  It was a nice touch.

Total came out to about $45/person including tax and tip, and most portions were reasonable/generous.  Overall, this was a solid restaurant.  I'd been looking forward to it for awhile.  Although not everything lived up to my built-up hopes, just about everything was at least good, and a few things really were excellent.",2010-07-13 17:03:55,

Rainy Fri. night after the show at Walnut St. Ran between raindrops a short way down Walnut. Marathon Grill, right? good reputation. My friend and I, (OK, 2 older types) walked in and wanted to just sit at the bar and have a drink (or two) and a snack (or two, or three). The hostess almost tackled us to sit at a table - maybe because sitting at the bar is discouraged. Just saying.  Ordered a beer (bartender seemed to be beer-challenged) and a gin and tonic (eh.)  Felt pretty unwelcomed (did I mention we are 2 older lady types?) Ordered a plate of hummus just till we got our bearings. Hummus was mashed chick peas with no flavor. No unedible, but...eh.

The noodles were a little thinner than I remember them, but they're fresh, and that really makes all the difference. For those who don't know Taiwanese beef noodle soup, the broth is supposed to be mildly spicy and salty, with a modest amount of chili oil and a hint of star-anise.

WHY they would ever think that starting up their ""late night table service"" was a good idea is beyond me...   One of the main things I loved about this place is that it's open late (10pm) and other coffeeshops nearby usually aren't. I live around the block, so I've seen it full in there even late at night... especially since the Penn bus and SEPTA bus stops right outside.  Now, 5:30pm and later thursday through saturday there are lights dimmed, candles on all the tables, and a new mediterranean dinner menu.

Besides the foie gras soup, there really wasn't a 'standout dish' which any of us ordered.  I had a sip of the foie gras soup.  Interesting initial taste with a subtle taste of the foie gras &  one of the better finishes to a soup I have tasted in quite a long time.  

What was disappointing was that so many of the dishes were underwhelming or even disappointing.  The claims with oriecchiette & fennel that I ordered had clams that were quite gritty.  Simply hadn't been cleaned sufficiently.  I wouldn't mind that if I ordered a bowl of steamers at a seafood place that had a few sandy clams.  Not a dish where you have several small neck clams where every one but one was gritty/semi-gritty.   

Chicken with brussel sprouts & sweet potatoes (overcooked and not well flavored), mascarpone with coffee granita & chocolate (too dry),  and lamb belly (again overlooked) were also underwhelming/disappointing.  

Seems like they are almost trying too hard at this point & working out the kinks especially in the kitchen.  Wouldn't be surprised if they won't have things working a bit better in the kitchen in another month or so. 

Wait staff was very professional and attentive.  Surprised though that our waiter recommended a bunch of the underwhelming dishes including the claims & oriecchiette.  

I also liked the layout & design.  It was loud but not overwhelmingly so.  Easy to hear dinner conservation at routine sounds levels.  It was nice not to have to yell or literally get right in the face of the person you wanted to speak with.

I came to Spot for lunch with my coworker earlier, and we were both really impressed with the menu, the burgers, and the service. Spot offers a pretty unique menu (burgers with everything from blue cheese to pickled daikon and gochujung paste) which is definitely enough to bring people in, but it's the juicy burgers, toasted buns, fresh veggies, and great flavors that will keep them coming back. 

We got the cheese-fries (fresh and good but nothing that'll blow your mind), the spot burger, and the umami burger. 

The spot burger was classic with a twist: a beef burger with bacon and chedder, pickles, coleslaw, and spot sauce. The pickles and slaw kept the burger tasting really fresh/not overwhelmingly meaty. 

The umami burger was definitely a bit heavier, but also more flavorful: grilled onions, mushrooms, pickled diakon, cucumber, gochujung, teriyaki, lettuce. I thought it was really great, the flavors were definitely there, but it was a bit too heavy for me so I couldn't finish my half. Definitely not something to get if you're trying to find something light!

Overally I was impressed, and I'd definitely be willing to come back again on a day when I'm really craving a burger!

For the first meal, I had the crawfish mac and cheese while my boyfriend had a pulled pork slider. The mac and cheese was served in a skillet - definitely a shareable appetizer, or in my case plenty for an entree. It was well seasoned, with the crawfish being flavorful, but not doused in spice, which I appreciated. The pulled pork slider was great - I prefer sauce to a dry rub, and the bbq sauce on this was delicious. He also had a very large portion. We each also had a beer, and the happy hour price was fair. By the time we left, the live music was still setting up, so we didn't get to see anyone perform.

The second time we went there, was for drinks and some snacks late at night. There was a late night menu, with a good number of options to choose from.

Crispy and fried, but not too dry on the inside. The sauces were also very flavorful.

We didn't feel like having our normal pizza or cheesesteak delivery, so we settled on Johnny G's because, well, to be perfectly honest, they have ribs!

The online ordering at GrubHub makes it so easy.  We ordered a feast!  Hubs had 1/2 a rack of ribs, potato salad, two meatballs and a house salad with blue cheese dressing.  I had the chicken parm entree which came with linguine and sauce and garlic bread.  

I am going to go out on a limb here and say this was the best chicken parm I have ever had.  The pasta and chicken were cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce tasted homemade, albeit  a tiny bit sweet.  Hubs loved his ribs, they came right off the bone and the sauce was delicious.  The potato salad was excellent and the meatballs were pretty good too.  

Everything was hot and fresh, and even came before the estimated time of delivery.  The driver was very pleasant and efficient. We couldn't have asked for anything more!

Of course I wanted something special for my mother on this day, so I gathered my siblings and their families and selected 3 places to attempt to get reservations. One was at the William Penn Inn, the other Route 6. I scoured the reviews and menus and decided Square 1682 was the best option. 

Square was super accommodating  with my large party of 12 and the customer service was outstanding. I canceled the reservation with the two other places and banked on Square delivering a great day. That was a mistake. 

Positive: The manager, staff, hostess, waitresses were super sweet. 

The mimosas were the best think i consumed that dining experience

Two  items were comped
 
Con's:
Two of our orders were mixed up ( another waitress took the ticket), so 10 of us ate while two of us watched. The late food arrived about 15 mins later. 

The prime rib sandwich was skimpy, grossly over cooked, and barely edible. I have had a LOT of prime rib in my life, this was thin and crunchy. It was served with a tiny bit of sauce on a firm fancy roll. My mother ordered the same and the disappointment on her face was awful. The others at the table had a variety of underwhelming dishes. No one was satisfied, but everyone was polite. I was crushed. 

There were a total of 5 mothers in that bunch and there was absolutely nothing special about it.  It was a nice room, the staff was nice, but it was one of the WORST dining experiences I have had in Philly.

I REALLY regret booking this place. We spent hundreds of dollars and everyone left a little quiet and disappointed. As a matter of fact my mother later confided she was STARVING after we left. 

I understand holiday restaurant service is maddening, but IMO this place was not properly staffed, nor prepared to handle providing good food on a special day. I would NEVER recommend someone come to this establishment. I wish I had chose one of the other places.

Now don't get me wrong I have  been to chickie and petes on several occasions and it was a great experience BUT last night made me feel like I was on a bad episode of BAR RESCUE.

1.  when we walked in (party of 3) the women at the hostess booth were so busy in their own conversation to even acknowledge that someone walked in. we waited for about 1 minute before even being acknowledge (STRIKE ONE)

2.  after being seated the waitress came right over and asked us what were we drinking.  didn't give us a minute to even look at the menu.  after ordering the drinks (which came out very fast) we order our appetizers.  the appetizers came out very fast which was great.  but we finished the appetizers and waited a good 10 minutes before the waitress came over and took our ENTREE order (STRIKE TWO)

3.  Entrees come out  (which were pretty good) and we finished them.  the waitress never not once came over and asked us how are we, did we need anything, she basically never came to check on us.  when she finally came over we asked for boxes  because we couldn't eat the rest of the food.  she brought us the boxes and left.  for another 15 minutes before we flagged her down and asked her for the check.  (which she should of brought when she gave us the boxes).  (STRIKE THREE)

**oh did I mention that it wasn't crowded?  so there was no need for the POOR customer service.


bottom line -- the FOOD here is GREAT,  but the customer service SUCKS ASS BIG TIME.  The waitress we had was very lazy, unprofessional, and act like she was intimidated by us.

Our reservation was at 9:15, but the people at our table were taking their sweet time in leaving, so we had a drink at the bar -- the bartender was so much fun!  I normally just have gin & soda or a martini, but the cocktail menu was inviting -- not too much crap in the drinks, nothing sweet -- so I got the thing with gin and aperol.  It was really refreshing, but - as a guy - I was a little embarrassed by the rose petals on the top.

Anyway, we sat down around 9:30.  We didn't experience any of the service problems mentioned by other reviewers (and LaBan), but it was also later on in the evening, so who knows.  In any event, our servers were prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.  I was a little annoyed, though, that no one came around with a crumb scraper.

So, the menu: prix fixe four courses, with five or six choices per course for $45 (+$30 for wine pairing), or prix fixe six course chef's tasting for $65 (+something for wine pairing).  The six courses that day were fish heavy, and didn't suit everyone at the table, so we didn't go for that.

I started with the (legendary?) foie gras soup -- it was great!  Creamy, but not heavy, with subtle flavors of the foie gras, lemongrass, and a little heat from chili peppers.  The soup was well paired with a sparkling rosé.

For the fish course, I had the black cod with miso glaze and kimchee.  The fish was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the addition of apple slices to the kimchee was amazing.  The fish was paired with a Falanghina, which was ok, but didn't do it for me.

The meat course I chose was the lamb chop.  The chop was beautifully cooked, and was tender, juicy, and extremely flavorful.  This was paired with oatmeal (which the server addressed, and assured me it was cooked with lamb stock and tasted like a risotto) and pork belly.  Neither the oatmeal nor the pork belly had ANY flavor.  The consistency of the oatmeal did add something, but otherwise, I think the lamb could have been paired with something better.  I don't remember the wine this dish was paired with, but I remember it being just ok.

I had the mascarpone with coffee granita for dessert -- it was good, and was paired with a nice port.  I tasted someone else's hot chocolate mousse, though, and was really jealous.  The mousse was phenomenal, and I highly recommend it.

All in all, I highly recommend this place, and will definitely be back.  I think next time, though, I will choose my own wine.",2012-03-03 17:29:02,"{'food': ['foie gras soup', 'black cod with miso glaze and kimchee', 'lamb chop', 'mascarpone with coffee granita'], 'drink': ['sparkling rosé', 'Falanghina', 'port', 'hot chocolate mousse']}"

I could see in the kitchen they were slowly cooking a couple items, and frying a small basket of hash browns. With the number of people in line they should have had a double order of everything on the grill and been hustling to get it all done.

So if you go, head to the left & stay on the downstairs level for a more relaxing & worthwhile experience... as far as the club portion is concerned, I guess research the DJ that's on for the night & take it from there.  Our waitor's name was Harrison & he is a wonderful gentleman who walked through the menu with ease to let us know what the favorites were.  It was a really amicable team that I encountered.  ; )

It's located a few blocks off of the main drag and down an alley. It certainly adds to the mistake of the place. Upon entering, we were greeted by a number of thick curtains that lead into the dining room. The dining room is dimly lit, and has some incredible Moroccan decor. Everyone sits on pillowed benches on which you can easily recline and there's a common small table that everyone it's from. It's very authentic! There's seating for around30 people in the downstairs dining area and an equally large dining room upstairs.

The Decour definitely heightens the food experience here as well. Everything is served from what is effectively a family-style menu. The five courses included pita with roasted vegetables - the roasted eggplant is absolutely incredible, a delicious puff pastry dish, some spicy chicken which was not too spicy and was incredibly flavorful, lamb dish, a beef dish, fruit and some of the best baklava we've ever had! Everything was good to great, the lamb was a bit overdone but had a good char.

Everything came out on platters and we shared throughout. If you're somebody who doesn't like other people touching your food, this probably isn't for you, but if you're cool with it it's delicious.

Came here for my second time last nite, on a trip to see a good friend and celebrate her engagement. I couldn't exactly remember what I had on the previous visit, but I knew that it ended in an orgasmic banana bread bread pudding... I mean come on, delicious. 

So, I knew I would be back.

This visit included: A wait of one hour (actually only 45 minutes or so) on a Saturday night around 8 pm. We got drinks at the bar, luckily snagging some stools in the packed area. You know if everyone around you is also choosing to wait the hour... it is that good. 
After a few glasses of wine, and a cosmo for me, we were led upstairs to a nice and much quieter dining room. 

I ordered a chicken skewer appetizer ($8) and my friend ordered a beautiful and delicate looking wedge salad ($9). My chicken skewer was very flavorful, and she loved her salad. 

Main courses: She ordered a lamb course ($22), which she raved about, but I wasn't brave enough to try. I got the pulled pork sandwich ($12), which was very good... slightly spicy for me- but I am a spice baby. It came with a simple side salad that I couldn't stop eating. And I ordered a side of mac and cheese with pork belly ($9). In hindsight, I wish I had ordered two or three mac and cheeses and called it a day.... it was so amazing!! 

And then as full as I was, I had to hear about the desserts. Which ended with a chocolate bread pudding with caramel sauce for me, and a passion fruit panna cotta for my friend. I believe they were each $8. I fortunately and unfortunately ate all of mine!! ha. I was extremely full.... but it was sooo worth it. 

As far as the service goes, I found all the waitresses and hosts very kind and helpful. They seemed to sincerely care if you had a good evening... and that is always appreciated.

We ordered a la carte because we are not yet filthy rich. For our antipasti, we got the TEMPURA SOFT SHELL CRAB which was ugh sooo goooood. Then our bread came, which was weird, and I thought the focaccia was to-die-for, the white tuscan not so much. For pastas we tried the SHRIMP & RICOTTA RAVIOLI, which just melted in your mouth but I think it reminded me too much of shrimp shu mai. We also had the DUNGENESS CRAB SPAGHETTI which was really disappointing - really salty, no crab to be seen, and the pasta was really hard and I know that's not what al dente is. Our secondi was the special, a SUCKLING PIG dish that was pretty much perfect, really decadent and crispy and salty and sweet.

So it was a mixed experience. I really expected better pasta (and bigger portions of it), but the antipasti and secondi were amazing.

Found in an alley-ish way of south street, Philadelphia, when you walk in, you are immediately transported to Morocco with the endless of carpets and tapestries hung on the walls, the music, and very dim lighting. 

About three floors, there are some private rooms if you have large parties - which they are very accommodating. Also have I mentioned it's BYOB (this is why Philadelphia is the best) - so feel free to bring whatever. They will provide the wine glasses and ice.

Now to the food. It is like an 8 course meal and I believe standardized - so being there  my second time, I knew what to expect. Served family style and without utensils so be prepared to just dig in with your hands - be careful the dishes come out very hot.

All the courses are great, some better than others. The lamb on the bone (forget what course number that was) is insanely good. No worries if you're a vegetarian, they are super accommodating and will bring out a separate plate for you. Some people love the 2nd course but I'm not the biggest fan - some type of powdered sugar pastry with eggs/chicken mix in it. Definitely keep an open mind here and just take in the experience.

There are also belly dancers that will come around and dance for your party.

Went with the 500 burger (lettuce, tomato, cheddar, bacon & special house sauce), truffle fries and a vanilla milkshake. I was starving by the time I'd gotten out of that line, almost a hour wait due to promos they were running with it being grand opening day and all, so I tasted a few of the fries as I walked back to the office, soooooo good! Wish I knew what the plain tasted like to compare not sure if I'm just in love with the truffle oil or if the fries as a whole are just that good either way the prices remain the same rather plain spicy or truffle. 

Then get back to my office and took a bite of the 500, it has bacon, real bacon on it!! Crispy salty in the right places chewy in the right places bacon. I don't know why but I have a hard time buying a good burger sandwich etc that has bacon on it and actually liking it so I was pleased. My burger was well done, and well seasoned, all around good burger. They did give me the wrong cheese however that may have been due to some order confusion so I let that slide and was still good. 

Lastly and my only real complaint is the milkshake. Very Very good no complaints there, the girl who made it however only filled my cup halfway and when I showed it to her, asking why it wasn't filled up she said because they don't have their correct cups yet so that is the actual serving. It looked like a serving for a kids meal so didn't sit right with me. Wasn't satisfied with that but walked away because I was hungry and needed to eat my food but saw that the guy in front of me was eating in and also ordered a milkshake so I asked to see his and there was a very small bit of space left at the very top, went back to let milkshake girl know this and asked the young lady next to me, also with a milkshake to be my witness LOL. She took my cup and put more in and don't think she was too happy about it but I got my reasonably portioned milkshake and it was goooood. And trust me I'm not that knit picky but  for money at that portion wasn't flying with me. Oh also with the milkshake it was more soupy than thick. I didn't mind that about it those that like shakes you need a spoon to actually eat not drink may not feel the same. 

They still get 5 stars from me for now because in the hustle of taking care of so many people, she may not have gotten a good look at my portion and she made up for it.

My gf ordered a glass a wine and he suggested getting a bottle because they offer it half off on Sunday. Seems like a great deal.

When we told her we were supposed to be seated first, she said there was no other place for the party of 5 and it was just logical to seat them there!?? In what world is that logical?  We walked out and will not go back. Went down the block to Barra Rossa, seated within 5 minutes, had excellent service!

I had the beets, the octopus, the pork and then the dirt w/ worms for dessert. YUM. 
My party sat at the counter so we could see everything being made and talk with the cooks- which was added fun. 
the beets were delicious, they have slices of makerel on top w/ radish. very flavorful and delicious.
the octopus was grilled and spicy- cool texture, but overall very light. 
the pork was to die for. seriously, it was so good I can still taste it if I think about it a week later. 
the dessert choices were the only things that seemed a little off to me. I had dirt and worms- which is basically mouse and cookie crumbles, so it all turned out ok in the end. but the choices weren't that extensive. my sister had apple crumble which was also delicious, but she commented that it would have been better warmed up.

The cafe options for good coffee are sparse between the Washington Square neighborhood and center city (and I had grown tired of looking at the empty Ethnics space), the Good Karma Cafe is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  

I ordered an iced coffee - its good to know they come in two sizes - 16 and 20 oz, along with a shot of espresso (at no additional charge), and that they also carry soy milk.  I decided to sit down with a magazine and my coffee and take in the atmosphere of the new space- its very open and still feels a bit empty- somewhat lacking the cozy atmosphere that makes a cafe seem so inviting.  I went to take a seat in the side room towards the back of the space, but the air felt a bit stuffy there so moved towards the front.  The music added a nice chilled out vibe, and the large paintings added some color to the otherwise white walls.  

The space up front near the counter is a bit barren, with the exception of two not-so-pretty drink coolers- it would be nice to see more tables here, or a counter with some stools.  There is also an atm inside, nice I suppose if you need a bit of extra cash (not sure if the cafe takes cards)...however, it would be nicer if the sound on the machine could be turned off- it beeps loudly every time a button is pressed- kind of distracting if you are reading or studying. Additionally, with the size of the space, before they opened, I was expecting more of a cafe- the kind that serves soups and sandwiches, in addition to coffee, tea etc., maybe this will happen eventually?  It would really be nice to have a quick sandwich/snack option in the neighborhood.

Make reservations, but don't be deterred if you forget. We had a 20 min wait for a late dinner.

The bbq pork sandwich is ok.  My main complaints are that the sesame bun is too soft, the chunks of pork are too big (and they aren't really juicy like what you'd expect pulled pork to be), the sauce is too sweet, and there isn't enough coleslaw (only a mouthful is placed on top of the meat, booooo).  We have tried the raw bar here too which is just ok as well.

However, I take off a star for how horrible of an experience it is just to get a seat each time I have come here for dinner whether it's closer to 5 or closer to 9pm (I didn't have to wait for lunch for 2 at 3:15pm, but for some reason the hostess still could not seat us promptly and seemed pretty confused at the prospect of seating us).  The dinnertime hostess SUCKS.  She either doesn't know what it means to be a hostess or hates her job and refuses to do it.  They always tell you some absurd wait time if you keep pushing since they're so vague and work so slowly (1 hr 45 min is a common number they use)--is this a strategy to deter people from bombarding this place?  One saving grace is that they'll take your number and will call you once your table is ready (which never takes as long as they claim).  I also think the seating arrangement sucks because there are a few booths that are quite nice if you have a big group (more than 4 ppl) but the tables are round so sharing food becomes difficult.  Otherwise, you are left staring at another couple throughout your meal.  There are plenty of bar seats which are always filled and then there is this weird back area that is just a shafted space. (And why is there this counter that runs all the way to the back of the restaurant that takes up space but serves no purpose? You can't stand there with your drink because the wait staff, hostess and customers going to the bathroom would constantly make you move).  I've never sat outside but it looks like a decent area.

The server was very pleasant and pleased to speak with a semi-native French-speaker. We shot the breeze a bit, which was nice, then my party and I ordered.
Between us, we'd ordered crêpe á la rivage (with tuna, egg, tomato), gâteau de crêpe au jambon (ham, mushroom, spinach), crêpe de mergeuz et something else (haha, I don't quite recall what he got in it other than the lamb sausage, I'm afraid) and nutella et poire (pear and nutella). 
We shared amongst ourselves and we all rather enjoyed them. The tuna one was less my style, but I couldn't stop raving about the ham. It's perfectly balanced of sweet, savoury and delicious and the paper/wafer-thin pancake had that lovely nutty aroma one can only get from a well seasoned pan. Hints of butter made me happy.
The lamb sausage one was cheese-filled. In fact, none of our orderes skimped on the fillings at all. One gripe from our group was the pear we chose for dessert; none of us save one had this issue, but he'd gotten, it seems, all the pear skins in his portion. Sorry, Dan, but the rest of us were enthralled!
Even after several visits, I don't think I could give above four stars due to pricing. I understand; Rittenhouse, yes, expensive, nonetheless, it may be a bit much for a light meal.

First - Poached Black Mission Figs - so savory and delicious! And I'm not even a big blue cheese fan, but these were perfect.

Anybody been?
Went last night, and really enjoyed it.  First of all, I'm not a giant fan of Mexican food, or heat, but I found this place to have enough choices that there were quite a few things I would have ordered easily.
Started with the empanadas de tinga, which were stuffed with good shredded chicken, some onions, and just enough heat. I'm sure there's something else in there, check the menu.  Another started was a very good salad, served with pineapple and pear, (I love salads with fruit in them) and a delicious cilantro dressing, the menu said glazed almonds, but they weren't there, and it was still very good.
Entree's were enchiladas de cangrejo y camaron, which was packed with tons of crab and shrimp, and the only complaint my companion had was that they wished the topping sauce was just a little spicier.
I ordered mole poblano, and I have to say, it was very good.  A very good size portion, served with rice and black beans (yech, don't care for those). We both couldn't finish our entree's because they were so generous, and we wanted to save room for dessert.  Flan....wonderful, but honestly, if you go there for no other reason, go for the banana crepes.  The crepe was so light, almost see through, and it was a very good finish to the meal.  I think the next time we go, we'll just order a bunch of the appetizers, and sample more.
No entree is over $20, with most in the $16/17 range.  Plus we had a groupon.
I liked it and thought the food and service was fine.  Such a nice little neighborhood treasure, I just thought I would share with anyone who hasn't been.

Personally have been to Zocalo a few times, with mixed experiences each time.  The food is on the upper end of decent, with my personal favorite being the chile relleno.  They seem to consistently pick good peppers and the spiced cheese is of a very nice quality, although the same cannot be said about the sides.  The beans routinely seem to be overcooked and the rice way too hard and undercooked.  Very unfortunate, but I guess that the main dish is where they put the most effort.  Students can avail of a 10$ lunch special, which is very very reasonable for a UC eatery with above-average food, and there is also a 25$ prix fixe menu which is a good option for those who aren't too financially constrained.

The story of the restaurant is nice, with a husband and wife who worked in the food industry for over 30 years outside the city coming together to open their own eatery and serve traditional food.

Perhaps I was missing something, but no one there is particularly interested in helping customers. Every time I go, I say ""I'm never going back there!""

We arrived right after opening and had our pick of tables. We grabbed a booth by the front and had a nice conversation with the hostess (friendly and welcoming). The menu had a reasonable variety of southern inspired options--we ordered chicken and biscuits, Bubba's Benedict (came with a side of pimento cheese grits), and coffee.

Our server, Marissa, was quick, attentive, and friendly, and the wait time for food was just long enough for us reminisce about our trip to New Orleans. The music and interior definitely reminded us of our time in Louisiana (the thrift store mugs and plates were all mismatched, but gave the restaurant a home-y vibe).

The food was fantastic. The biscuits were flaky and moist, the chicken was well fried and tender. The pimento cheese grits were smooth, flavorful, and unique. The food wasn't greasy or too filling--we left feeling satisfied.

I'd like to first respond by suggesting that you take someone's review based on a restaurant week experience with a grain of salt.  Seriously...  it's restaurant week, and you're someone who wants to be a hip, know-it-all foodie for 1 week but otherwise orders out for pizza.

I've eaten here many many (emphasis on many) times and have never been disappointed with the food.  If you want to be sure that they don't prepare the food & leave it under the heat lamp for ages, as one reviewer speculated, just look in the little circular window as you walk in and watch them make it. There are no secret cover-ups. 

Lunch is pretty busy, since the restaurant is located on the 4th floor of an interior design building and there really aren't a lot of other places in the immediate area, but the sandwiches  are such a great alternative to the typical hoagie fare.   
my lunch favorite: Cocotte - white meat chicken salad with grapes, basil, apple, walnuts, celery and dijon mayonnaise on pita bread.

The salads are large and there's a diverse selection.. not just garden salad vs. caesar, but some unique and creative combinations and they are definitely satisfying on their own.

Get the sweet potato fries!

Dinner time is almost never crowded. You probably don't need a reservation unless it's a special event. Ask to sit by a window, the views (in either room) are incredible. You get the river with the bridge lit up at night, 30th street station and, though it's better to see during the day, the art museum. The lack of crowds mean you can have an intimate conversation with your guests comfortably.

Patrice is amazing. It is not often that the owner/chef of a restaurant will come out during dinner to go table to table and ask if everything is OK. His accent will also make you melt, which is always a plus for me.

I think it's usually empty because of its location. There is not much around and it can be a little shady at night time, but if you can quickly shuffle a couple blocks to Chestnut or Walnut, you're back in the mix of it all again, safe and sound.",2010-03-26 03:57:11,"{'food': ['sandwiches', 'salads', 'sweet potato fries'], 'drink': []}"

No one said hello or bring us water. The waitress brought the table next to us their check and attended to them multiple times.  She then proceeded to clean the table on the other side of us.

  As amazing as the burger was the truffled cauliflower pickles with ricotta, and olive tapande. This place is micro in seating and macro on experience. The duck fat fries were good but the aura from the burger was so blinding, it obscured anything near the plate.

Like a popular night club with a long line outside, Village Whisky will always have a wait to pull up to their tables.

The lights come on and she's all gone. And you're left feeling exhausted yet satisfied and ready to tell everyone about what happened.

fried dumplings, just ok - not as good as mommas and not quite as good as mine;

fried oysters in black bean and chili sauce - disappointing, the sauce was too salty and the batter on the oysters was too thick and doughy - so the oysters were like meatball sized glops;

kung pao scallops - ok, better than panda express if you get my drift;

duck in lemon sauce - this reminded me of the food court favorite, the duck was fine though it would have been better if it was prepared in a way that some of the fat left the meat and it was literally swimming on a pond of lemon simple syrup that made me cringe inside (i.e. there was no real lemon)

the rice was kinda lacking, not good quality, and serving it in an open steel bowl means it gets cold fast

I felt so conflicted after the meal. I walked out of Sbraga knowing full well that it has the potential to join the ranks of the great restaurants in Philadelphia, but it is just not there yet. I have to say though, considering that it is barely a few weeks old, it did well and i expect ratings for this place only to go up.

I went to Sbraga with a group of friends with great expectations despite the place being new. We wanted to try as many dishes as possible and since the tasting menu only starts the next week, we ordered as much dishes as the table can take and did it family style so I can do this review.

Service: The biggest letdown. The inexperience of the service is apparent despite their willingness. Service is frustratingly slow at the start (10 minutes to get water. 20 minutes to prepare my cocktail which came too late to be even called an apertif anymore), but improves as the courses arrive.

First Course:
Sweetbreads - decently good, like the idea of fleur de sel on top of it and the capers to go along
Blue Crab - nice and creamy, but still reeks of the ""crabby"" smell
Foie Gras Soup - I would say its an awesome soup if it was't called lemongrass cream soup. the lemongrass and other spices were so overpowering it killed the dish. nothing else makes sense afterwards. respect your ingredients please. modern cuisine for modernity sake is not the way to go.

Second Course:
Fish and Chips - nice take on the classic F&C, enjoyed it
Artic Char - I adored this dish despite my other companions calling it ""just a salmon."" balance of the cream and the fish is great.
Labne Ravioli - I couldnt understand this dish. Anchovies brought did not give the intended effect as the ""fishiness"" was too strong. tone it down and it would be great
Lobster Tail - executed to perfection. curry goes perfect with it as a complement. dump the dumpling and it would have been one of the best lobster dishes i ever had.

Third Course:
Lamb Belly - too much granola, other than that, its pretty amazing
Meatloaf - its great, i may be insulting it but it reminds me of Ikea meatballs when the sweet cuts the savory in the perfect balance.
Duck - average. really.
Top Sirloin - hands down worse dish of the night. soggy marrow crust, unevenly cooked. overdone top and medium bottom when i requested for medium rare. worst of all: IT WAS DRY. only dish i did not want to eat after a bite.

Desserts:
Singapore Sling - its disgraceful but im a Singaporean who hasnt tasted the Singapore Sling cocktail. its pretty good but needs to scale down on the lemongrass again.
Chocolate, Mascarpone - awesome richness and creaminess. choux provided the perfect textural contrast.
Apple Mille-Feuille - average at best despite the good creme chantilly
Pineapple Financier - a must order. pineapple crisp was so awesome.
Cheese Plate - brie was good but im just not a fan.

After my meal, I sent a pretty pointed email to the restaurant about my honest opinions and I appreciated that Chef Kevin took the effort to personally look into it.

As for Erawan's Pad Thai, it's just alright and the price of the dish was a little high. I had the vegetarian option. It lacked flavor and texture for me but it's not bad. However, I'm willing to give Erawan another try.

""Uhh, if this place is closed who the hell answered the phone last night and delivered that pizza? Whoever they were did a bang-up job on my large pie with broccoli rabe.

They have a semi-chunky sauce (dangerously close to too heavy on the garlic) combined with a medium thickness crust with enough crunch for it all to play together nicely. The rabe was abundant, but not to the point of overpowering the pizza (which is a legitimate concern, that shit is pungent).

I'll have to order some wings next time to settle my internal struggle between Lazaro's and Gianna's.""",2010-01-18 13:51:37,"{'food': ['pizza', 'wings'], 'drink': []}"

I work close to this spot and since it had been over a year since my last visit, I decided to try it today for lunch.
I originally ordered the pappardelle with prosciutto and peas. I remembered their pastas being really yummy so I made the decision quickly.
Once it arrived, there was no prosciutto, there were chunks of red onion everywhere and the sauce was bland. It was so bad that I actually asked for a different dish altogether because I couldn't get myself to eat it.
I ordered the penne vodka, which was the dish I ordered in the past that left me the memory of good pasta at this restaurant.... well, that turned into a disappointment as well. There were chunks of what I think was prosciutto in it, which really shouldn't be in a vodka sauce, and the meal overall was just OK.
I am in no rush to come back here any time soon. It's such a shame though, because my memories of it were much more positive. I wonder if the chef changed?",2013-08-07 17:47:23,"{'food': ['pappardelle', 'penne vodka'], 'drink': []}"

Trattoria Carina is the next evolution in this spot. The location and staff are the same for the most part, but they blew up the menu and started from scratch and totally redecorated the interior. 

Carina seems to be trying to fly under the radar while they discover their new identity, they have no online presence, and seem to be operating as a walk-in discovery to whomever decides to venture in, and I am so glad I did. My partner and I sat outside, and pondered the menu for a while before deciding on ordering the some wine and grilled broccoli (normally a side for an entree) to start. The broccoli was perfectly grilled and had delicious cheese and breadcrumbs sprinkled throughout, and was a perfect start to the meal. Carina doesn't yet have a wine list, and they have a simple listing of white, rose, and red wines available. We tried the red and rose, and were very happy with what they provided.

For entrees we ordered two pasta dishes. The Shells Granchio Arrabbiato (or spicy crab) was delicious, the sauce had just a little punch to it, and there was not much in the way of crab (it was mostly small pieces sprinkled throughout). What we discovered then is that Carina is looking to really drill down and emphasize their speciality - home made pasta. The sauce and other ingredients are there to lift up and emphasize the pasta. While amazing, I normally would look for a little more when ordering a $20+ plate of food than just pasta, sauce, and a little protein, but whoa was it delicious. 

The Gemelli Genovese was likewise very tasty. Whoever makes Carina's pesto sauce should be kissed. This dish likewise was light on other ingredients, with very thinly shaved pieces of cauliflower layered throughout. Again, I would normally look for more to a dish like this, but what they brought was a treat for the mouth. 

For dessert we got hazelnut gelato, which was also very delicious - though it was served with a somewhat strange pretzel cookie, which seemed to serve as a palette cleanser, but didn't really seem to go with the gelato. I ordered a flourless chocolate cake which was sprinkled with confectionery sugar and which was perfectly moist throughout and had an explosion of pure chocolate flavor. My partner thought it could use some fruit to go with it (raspberry maybe) but I was fine with it just the way it was. 

Service was also fantastic - Bruce was constantly buzzing by our table, answering questions and giving us tips. If you go make sure to give your feedback to the staff, as they are definitely looking to refine, revise, and evolve this place into a neighborhood spot that will last, and I hope it does.

Sure, you occasionally get a dud (please don't drink the Hambleton Sugar Ale, it's made from Molasses and really was horrid, I should have payed more attention to the label) but that is only to be expected with a selection like this and I guess someone out there in Philly probably thinks my dud is the best bottle of fermented hops to ever run across their lips...

The selection of beer glasses from around the world (or stolen from the nearest pub with authentic glasses, who knows) are great and I always look forward to my birthday and a few more pieces of drinking paraphernalia .

Where to start... I've had makeout sessions here, jumped out the window, nearly killed myself going down the steps to the wc, danced to the jukebox, fallen asleep in the back and of course... drunk and merry.

It's a typical Philly row-home-turned-irish-style-pub. There's a great fireplace in the back I've never seen lit, and around it are huge, heavy wooden bench seating around 4 massive tables. It's good for a big group. Smaller tables up front and more seating upstairs for proper dining. 

In the front part of the bar are two side windowledges which are perfect to perch on. Forewarning, ledge is about 7 feet from the ground, so if you jump out of them, don't do it in high heels. 

Good beer list though it seems to lack local brews. I'm not much of a beer drinker so it doesn't matter. They carry Pimm's!! The bartenders are fun. (Ask for Eileen by singing or screaming ""COME ON EILEEN!!!"" She loves that.)

Try the filet and goat cheese sliders. So delicious!!! Food here is much nicer than typical bar fare. The mac and cheese is freshly baked with a good sharp cheddar, there's goat cheese on more than just the sliders, the lamb shank looked delicious though I haven't had it. 

I wish they had outdoor seating. It was such a beautiful spring night the other night which is how i discovered prime window-ledge seating.",2011-06-05 16:14:22,

Salmon Tartare: There was no salmon, I'm pretty sure. It was mushy tomatoes and olives in a ring mold with balsamic vinegar from the Christmas Tree Shop drizzled on top.

Striped Bass: First of all, Im pretty sure it was flounder. Second of all, there was no goat cheese as promised. Third of all, it tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day.

today was one of those days where we were willing to wait the 45 minutes while our stomachs rumbled in anticipation of the meal to come. we passed the time by people watching and contemplating whether to go breakfast or lunch (seeing as it was 2pm), all the while growing more & more eager as other 2-tops being called had tired of the wait and left, making us that much closer to Next.
 
within moments of sitting down, we were handed menus and asked if we wanted coffee - yes, please! since enjoying the enfrijoladas so much on my last visit, i was set on ordering them again. this time instead of getting it made with tofu, i went for the vegan sausage. equally as delish. as if that wasn't enough food, i added a latke + [homemade] applesauce on the side for a mere $2.50. 

my boyfriend went the lunch route and ordered the brisket sandwich, topped with melted cheese & sauteed spinach, served with a side of horseradish sauce & fries. this led to me eating fries for the 3rd time this week (that's typically how many times i eat them in a month!) as i simply could not resist dipping them in the tangy horseradish sauce.

there are so many veg-friendly options at honey's that i sorta kick myself for getting the same one twice, but i fully intend to eat here enough to try everything [meatless] on the menu.

1.  My first visit to Fed Nuts was last year.  I was talking to one of the owners outside who is a friend of mine.  I was hungry and chicken sounded perfect.  I walked in and ordered a spicy chicken from the super awesome Blake F.... this is how it went down

I pushed open the screen door and my senses were overloaded in fried goodness. My life seemed rather dull and lusterless before inhaling the medley of donuts and chicken.  A familiar face was at the counter and beaming her winning smile.  

""Hey buddy, good to see you!"" I said.
""Hey there, welcome!"" she replied.
I could barely contain my hunger at this point. If I wouldn't look insane for licking the sweet air, I would have.
""Can I get the spicy chicken?"" I said.  God knows I love everything spicy and fortunately, luck was on my side.
""You bet, 1 spicy"" she commanded.

I paid and waited for my chicken.  As I was admiring the simple establishment that has nailed the adage, ""Do a few things VERY well instead of a lot of things crappily,"" an old timer walked up and adjusted his worn cover.  He ordered chicken but his fortune was not as mine.

""Sorry, we just ran out, he got the last one.""  
The seasoned Philadelphian turned to me with a mired glare that said ""you gotta be shittin me.""  I really wondered if he would wait idly in on a wooden stool and leap for the box of chicken as it offered to me, only to run out the door with a super villain cackle.  Didn't happen though, he left with a donut and I ate the chicken.

2. I ran an experiment where I brought them in to work and let a bunch of people try them.  Invariably, every person would take a bite and say, ""This is like the best donut I've ever had.""",2013-02-28 13:00:56,"{'food': ['spicy chicken'], 'drink': []}"

I must have gone past it tens of times while driving down Kelly Drive, but I never thought to look up at the kind of nondescript, set-back building and realize it was actually a restaurant. We only tried In Riva after my brother-in-law raved about it, so we thought we'd give it a try with another couple. It was one of the best dinners out we had a long time.

In Riva's website says it specializes in Neopolitan-style wood-fired pizza and antipasti, which isn't entirely accurate because all their courses are equally delicious. I can't remember exactly what we ordered but it included some salumi and formaggi, pea soup, pork ribs, charred octopus, a trio of pastas and a mushroom and zucchini pizza. Everything was delectable. My favorite was the agnolotti with pea, shallot and truffle. It was the best pasta I've had in Philly (my favorite pasta is at L'Artusi in NY), though I hear Vetri's pasta is amazing. 

What makes In Riva so wonderful is that it is so unassuming. It has a casual, dark wood, industrial-feel interior that doesn't ring of pretense, yet the food rivals any of the best-known, heralded nouveau cuisine restaurants in Philly. In fact, the two meals I've had at In Riva have knocked the socks off the past two meals I had at Amada, which used to be my favorite Philly restaurant.

I just noticed Andrew B's negative review and understand that he thinks In Riva may be overpriced. I think because In Riva looks so casual, one would expect the price point to also be casual. I agree the pasta serving size could be bigger. I paid $11 for the agnolotti dish that I ate in a few bites and could have easily downed another order. But, truth be told, we shouldn't eat that much. The price reflects the quality, not quantity, of food.

Philadelphia Magazine recently published the top 50 restaurants in Philly issue, and I eagerly looked for In Riva's name to be listed. Not this year, but hopefully next.

From the start this hovel of mediocrity fell on its face by not seating us at all; the hostess was not even at the door. We seated ourselves. Once we were in, the bar-tending waitress, who seemed to be running the show upstairs, took our drink orders, all the while giving off the aura of disdain and employment-regret that could sear hair off.

We had to wait around for over 30 min for someone to take our actual orders and after I took it upon myself to express to the waitress that were getting antsy. The forceful OK and stare I got back did tick me off but I decided I wouldn't make a huge deal of it. I gave her a well-timed ""Alright, [pause] Thank You"" until she broke eye contact and went back to our table. Not a pleasant experience. Even after all of this, someone was sent to ""confirm"" our orders 10 min later.

When we finally received the food it didn't impress me terribly. The Fish and Chips plate was plentiful but the fish itself was somewhat greasy and bland. However, the Humus platter was huge and pretty darn tasty (but nothing that can't be found elsewhere). Decent prices though.

The dcor of this place was as mediocre as was everything else about it. Wooden booths and low lighting define this place, as well as ever other pub everywhere else; the only distinction being the occasional framed picture of a sheep.

(I must admit I did not get to see much of the lower floor and dined upstairs)

The upstairs had large windows that may open to take in some night air - but they were closed when we were there.

This small corner storefront just a stone's throw from Rittenhouse Square serves the lunchtime masses with, dare I say, excellent tasting Vegan sandwiches and salads.  After having many a friend recommend that I try this place, I finally decided to give it a shot.

I'll admit that the place seems gimmicky with its whole ""everything is sustainable and earth friendly"" pitch, but I appreciate that HipCity Veg puts just as much effort into its food as it does into creating its ambiance and aesthetic.  I decided to try the Crispy HipCity Ranch, which includes chick'n, LTO, pickles, and peppercorn ranch.  At first bite, I swore I was eating meat, and had to remind myself that everything I was putting my mouth was 100% vegan (even the dressing).  The sandwich was juicy, flavorful, and a good balance between the protein and supporting ingredients.  It was actually a very well proportioned and constructed sandwich, I probably could have eaten two of them.  I can't wait to try more of their menu items.

I also want to give them props on outstanding customer service.  I attempted to get my free Green Lemonade upon first Foursquare checkin, but the cashier accidentally charged me for it.  When they realized their mistake, they went the extra mile to make sure that I didn't get charged for the Lemonade and solved everything by the time my lunch was ready.  Kudos to them!

My only complaints are the storefront size and price.  This is definitely a take-out spot, as there are only a handful of seats inside (but when the weather's nice, you can easily head to Rittenhouse Square to eat al fresco).  It's also a bit pricey, and in the grand scale of things, why pay $8.50 for fake chicken when you can go to a food truck and get the real thing for less?  The $4 for fries though seems downright heinous.

But I think if anything, this place will change the way you think about vegan cuisine and its limitations, especially if you're convinced that vegan food is always super healthy.  These guys easily blow that notion right out of the water.  However, it's a shame that there aren't more places like this that exist in Philly, but if trend is any indication (especially with nearby Crisp and Maoz), hopefully there will be more gourmet vegan and vegetarian lunch options to come.  For now, I'm eagerly awaiting my next trip to HCV.",2012-08-22 16:53:17,

I was greeted by a not so friendly cashier, who seemed to also be the manger.

Other than the lack of hospitality, I will say the food was okay. The fries, banana shake and the cola w/ cane sugar was AMAZING.

We went to Spruce Street Harbor Park to enjoy the nice lights and drinks they have there during the summer. It was close to 11pm by the time we were walking back to our car and we never had dinner (because we had a late lunch), so we decided to see if there was anything open nearby we could eat at before getting in our car to drive home. We first stopped by 2nd Story, but they already stopped serving food by then, so we asked if they knew of any place still serving food nearby. This is the place he recommended.

I wasn't sure if I'd be able to find anything for myself, being that I'm a vegetarian, but they had numerous vegan options, even vegan desserts! However, I opted for the nachos off the appetizer menu. As ecstatic as I was that they were vegan-friendly, the vegan options were things like bbq pulled pork, bbq ribs, etc. None of which I ever ate as a carnivore, so even though it was vegan, I wasn't interested. You'd think of all the vegan stuff they had, and all the normal stuff they normally serve at pubs, they'd have a veggie burger, but oh well. The nachos weren't bad (although, I prefer nacho cheese, rather than melted cheese because melted cheese tends to harden quickly). I also got the sweet potato bisque off of their specials menu and that tasted like baby food, so I wouldn't recommend that if you ever see that on the menu.

I had some of the sides my family got with their orders and the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese are amazing! If I ever end up here again, I am definitely going to just order myself a bunch of sides.

When I saw this place had over 200 ratings and a 4.5 average I expected something more than what I got.  I ordered the falafel platter which came with Tabouleh salad, hummus, mixed vegetables & a side of pita.

As a whole, everything seemed to be at least a day old. Everything was very stale and just did not feel right as you attempted to chew it.  If I ever storm a castle and have archers firing at me from atop a tower, I would like to be wearing armor made from the falafel because I would be unstoppable.  The pita, I would not serve to small children nor the elderly because it's a choking hazard. It had the consistency of that fruit leather you used to get from the cafeteria in elementary school. 

You know how if you put a lot of sugar in your coffee people make that joke ""You want some coffee with your sugar?"" Well that's what they would say about the amount of parsley in the Tabbouleh.  I understand Tabbouleh is supposed to have a lot of parsley, but this was to the point where I couldn't call it Tabbouleh.  They just gave me straight up minced parsley with a countable amount bulgur grains that seem to have accidentally fallen in.

The hummus was not that bad. It tasted like it had a bit too much lemon juice going on and maybe could have used a bit more tahini, but overall it was just ok.

The overall taste of everything was not bad, but it did not resemble anything that I would call close to good. Think of a delicious cheesesteak from Pat's or Gino's or Dalessandro's that's a day or two old.  It would taste like it's a day or two old, but you could still tell that it would have been delicious had it been fresh. I can't say that with the meal I just had from Smiley's.  It didn't taste bad like I could not stand putting it into my mouth, but I can't say I found it even pleasant. I'd get as excited for it as I would for a plain bowl of oatmeal made with water.

I think I rate very fairly and it hurts me that I have to give this establishment such a low rating.

The staff was inattentive and unfriendly right off the bat.  That being said,  places can have bad service and still have good food, and we had been interested in stopping by the Fishtown location for some time, so we figured we'd give them a shot anyway.  I ordered the Almost Pastor tacos, my friend ordered the Fat Man burrito, and we got the poutine to share.  The tacos were bland and boring.  The pineapple was less than fresh, the pork was tough, and it seems they completely forgot any seasoning whatsoever.  I took a couple bites and just didn't feel like it was worth the calories, so I gave up.

The burrito was sizeable, so my friend suggested we just share that instead.  The burrito and poutine however, were completely the opposite.  There was plenty of flavor, and would be great if your preferred flavor is salt, and only salt.  The poutine was so salty that the other flavors didn't come through at all.  I think my blood pressure went up 20 points by the first bite.  The Fat Man burrito was just totally inedible.  Unless you happen to be a horse, or some other animal that enjoys a salt lick.  It was seriously gross.  After a couple bites, we actually decided to toss all the food and went next door to Stockyard to split a sandwich instead.  We didn't see the point in complaining since the staff was less than cordial from the beginning.

I am having A Situation with my roommate, which has its benefits.  Namely, my friends are all throwing me a pity party, and J offered to take me out to lunch to this little cafe.  She promised me mind-blowing food.

I had never had Trini cuisine before, so I didn't know what to expect, but I was excited.  We bounced through the modest front, past the pastry cases and tried to order doubles.

What we quickly found out is that what food on the menu is available here varies a lot by time and day of the week.  Undaunted, we decided to wait a half hour for the rotis and ordered two vegetable pastries for 1.50$ each.  SCORE!  The dough was clearly baked in-house.  The vegetables were seasoned well and tasty, but I just can't get my mind off of that dough.

After finding out all my carnivore options had bones, I chickened out and ordered a soya roti.

Hold the phones.

This sandwich?, which is deceptively tiny, is served in aluminum wrapper.  You split it open, stare longingly at it and dive right in, probably burning your mouth in the process.  BUT DEAR GOD.  This roti was popping with chickpeas and soya, which had the taste and texture of meat.  The spices!  I have no idea what they were!  They were great!  AND AGAIN THE DOUGH.  It was so filling and wonderful and delicious.  Ask for the yellow goopy hot sauce, and use it sparingly -- it has a great flavor too, but it has a slow, long, loooong burn.

We met the chef (she plopped down in the booth behind us with a Coke) and chattered about her cooking process, and everyone was patient with our fumbling and my baby ""wah wah bones"" shtick.

The shrimp and seared ahi tuna tacos were also a big hit, although a white fish would be more welcome on fish tacos as the fleshy tuna just doesn't quite cut it for this dish.  With the lime juice and accompanying condiments it's just not as complimentary as say a sea bass or even codfish.

When we walked in we were asked, ""How many?"" I said: ""Five.""  As we were being led to our tables, one of the women with us asked if we could sit at a round table that we just walked past.  They obliged.  I wasn't feeling well, so I asked the gentleman seating us for Chinese tea.  He said ok and left.

Then another person came to serve us.  She asked if we were ready to order.  I sensed an attitude from her right away.  Nonetheless, I place my order, which was for Chinese tea, as that's all I was planning to have.

The other women with me were still looking at the menus, but went ahead and placed their drink orders.  The server then appeared agitated.  As she was walking away to get our drinks, I asked if there was a problem (remember, I'm not feeling well, so I'm not putting a lot of energy or neck movements into my question).  She said, ""I asked if y'all were ready!""  You see, she wanted to take our *entree* orders, not our drink orders.  That's what she meant by ""ready.""  When we only gave her our drink orders, it frustrated her and she let us know with her poor attitude.

Not only is the food undoubtedly one of the best I've had in Philly, but the service is impeccable. It turned out that the restaurant had done something wrong with my reservation, so my dining companion and I had to sit at a small, high table near the bar area. It really was no biggie, but Ben (the manager) insisted on sending over a few dishes on the house - incredibly generous! In addition to the 4 that we ordered, we had about 5 others, all of which were delicious. Some standouts were: the hot chicken (crunchy, juicy, extra spicy) with the white bread and creamy ranch dressing; the shrimp and grits (not too heavy and the shrimp tasted fresh and meaty); the baked mac and cheese (flavorful and crunchy from the barbecue potato chips, sprinkled over the top); and tender pulled pork on white bread and thinly sliced pickles. Really though - you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

I'm sure I would've enjoyed the meal, even without those extra dishes, but what made it better was the hospitality and service of the entire staff.  The dining area itself is small as the other reviews say, but it has this warmth and coziness that doesn't make it feel cramped at all.

When she finally made her way to our table she took our drink orders and returned shortly with our cokes. She spilt mine, apologized and then continued to clean the table - sticking her armpit in my face. This wouldn't be so bad if she wasn't wearing a skimpy strapless dress and didn't smell as though she had never heard of deodorant (talk about unappetizing).  

     We ordered our food; which included chicken parmesan, a steak burger and a grilled chicken sandwich. We waited AN HOUR or more for our food, during which I suggested plenty of times that we should leave. Also during which, a women who looked like the old witch from Snow White tried to strike up a conversation with my little sister and touched her/was very close to her and made her almost cry in fright (my sister is 9).

     When our food came, we were already having the worst dining experience we have EVER had. Spoiler alert: it didn't get better.
 
      My spaghetti in my chicken parm wasn't even drained and had no sauce!? When I asked for more, we were charged 75¢. My chicken was chewy and disgusting. Same goes for the grilled chicken sandwich. No one enjoyed their meals. Even the pop tasted gross which makes the fact that they charge full price for refills even worse!

The sandwich was not the soggy puddle of buttery cheesiness that I have come to expect from grilled cheese over the years. The bread was crisply toasted, the cheese was melted but not burned or pure liquid.

Somehow, it actually achieved standard grilled cheese satisfaction levels without making me nervous that I'd start feeling pain in my left arm and get light-headed moments after eating it.

Restaurant itself is beautiful, and it's not a bad place to grab a happy hour drink, but I wouldn't eat there again. Definitely not one of Jose Garces' better spots.",2018-06-21 14:00:34,"{'food': ['OK', 'small', 'pricy'], 'drink': ['meh', 'happy hour']}"

A bad experience last night - me and my regular dining partner here had terrible service while sitting at the bar.  The bartenders were indifferent, we had to practically beg for water, drink orders, dinner order.  While I love the Fish House Punch, the love is tempered when it takes 15 minutes to get it - and no - it was not even that busy.  My pal's burger was delicious according to her, my oysters - which were herb roasted were generally flavorless and the Sly Fox Cheddar Sauce with our duck fat fries was tasteless and runny.  Dear Jose - please come and visit your restaurants and keep them on their toes...

We both agreed that we may cross this off our list after years of it being our go-to spot.",2015-01-23 12:15:16,"{'food': ['Fish House Punch', 'Burger', 'Oysters'], 'drink': ['Fish House Punch', 'Sly Fox Cheddar Sauce']}"
