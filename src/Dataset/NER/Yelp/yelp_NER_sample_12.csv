However today--- I just so happened to lean over the counter. I saw the cook make some fresh orders of mac n cheese for  customers that were sitting down yet used some old mac and cheese balls for me and threw them in the microwave.

Honestly, I'm. Not a cell phone provider so I do not control the technology.  My phone was on, the end.

Street seats always look filled, so we figured a popular neighborhood place - nearly every night of the week - had to be good. The interior was WAAAY too cold when we arrived for dinner, but thankfully there was an open table outside for the two of us that we snagged. I'd rather be a little warm than freezing, and at least there was a breeze moving the humid air and our ice cold water kept being refilled by attentive staff. 

I wasn't too hungry - heat does that to me - so I decided to order two appetizers and forgo a drink. But my fiance ordered the special IPA they had on tap after our waitress said it was supposedly considered THE BEST IPA out there. He had to agree after his first sip. We didn't wait long for food, and what came out of the kitchen was great. I got the steamed manila clams with fennel, roma tomatoes, and a white wine sauce with two pieces of grilled bread to start, and the clams were cooked perfectly (although I wish there had been a few more!). I even allowed my fiance a piece of bread to sop up the delicious broth, which he loves to do. I also ordered the crispy Farmer's egg, breaded and fried, and served atop poached white asparagus, with prosciutto aspic and pickled mustard. An unusual looking dish, and very minimal, but the subtle flavors work and I cleaned that plate. My fiance went with my suggestion and tried one of their burgers, the Parliament Burger with carver's bacon, english cheddar, pub sauce, and fries.

So, I came here the other night during the week with a few friends. Overall, I felt a bit disappointed, perhaps my expectations were too high, but I will be giving it another try on a different night.

Ambiance: Nice setting & simple setup. The place was calm as expected for an early weekday night. 

Service: This is the one element that left a distinctly poor impression on my visit but it is also why I will certainly return again to re-review my experience. It was apparent our server was new and probably in training. It did make for a less than perfect meal. Many of the items we attempted to order from drinks to food, was no longer offered... I understand the restaurant can certainly run out of menu items but it would be best to inform the modified menu in the start of the meal rather than to have to repeatedly be told that ""That is also out tonight ..."" Still not the worse service I have seen, I look forward to my second try.

Drinks: Thumbs up. The wine and beer list was varied with a good number of glass options for the wine. 

Food: As others have written before me, the local burger was enjoyable. The meat was perfectly cooked to a juicy medium (for me). It was a manageable but filling portion with a balance of flavors to boot. However, the fries were cold and the bun was a bit hard/chewy to bite through.

The pizzas here are out of control delicious--flavorful crusts and wonderful toppings combine to make excellent pies. 

The cocktails are really refreshing and change seasonally. The antipasti offerings are also great--the whipped ricotta is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser thanks to caramelized onions, sweet ricotta, and buttered crusty bread. The spring pea soup is also incredible! A great place for elevated pizza take out (it reheats beautifully) and an even better place to go with friends and/or family.

I had heard such great things about the famed Starr comfort food restaurant. So this morning, when I finally had a morning off to go to breakfast, I knew where I was headed! Jones got an award in my book, and I'm very sad to say it was an award for ""hands down worst service I have EVER received at a restaurant"". 

Let me preface this review by saying I completely respect the job servers do. They're constantly on their feet, they get paid low and rely off their tips, and I know that's pretty hard sometimes. And I always give leniency because I know this job is hard. But this service was god awful. 

Was seated immediately upon arrival and say upstairs in a cozy two person booth. So far, so good. That's when it went downhill. Didn't see our waitress for the first 15 minutes. When she finally came over (don't know her name because she never introduced herself), she took our order to start, which was for 2 bloody marys (deliciously customized),  2 coffees, and the monkey bread appetizer. 10 minutes later, beginning to get frustrated, again, she comes over with 2 waters. We were a little confused, but thought maybe it was just protocol to also get waters. But, low and behold, 2 minutes later, she comes back and snatches away our coffee cups and our menus, too quick to even stop her. Um... I needed both of those??!?! 

Next, our monkey bread appetizer and Bloody Marys arrive, and halfway through devouring the delicious bread, we finally flag her down and ask her again for coffee, and if we can possibly order. (Mind you she took our menus so this was a little tough.) She was non apologetic but politely took our orders. She came back with coffee, and spilled the creamer all over my dates shoe. (This is the one thing that's not her fault - accidents do happen.) We helped her mop it up with our napkins, and there was still creamer all over my dates shoe when she ran off with the sopped up napkins, and what do you know, she never came back with more. And she never brought us spoons to stir the coffee, so we were at a loss here. Losses, really.

So our food comes out, so yummy looking, and I don't have silverware (or a napkin). Sat there for 5 minutes, never saw our waitress and honestly knew I never would, so my date stole me a set off another table.

This whole experience was nothing short of a DISASTER.

After getting the main entrees, she never checked on us, it took forever for her to pick up or bill... Just awful awful awful. As we were leaving the couple next to us made a comment as to how awful the service was also.

It's a shame because if the service had been better, this would've been named my favorite Starr restaurant, because the food was so delicious.",2013-10-06 23:19:15,"{'food': ['bloody marys', 'coffee', 'monkey bread appetizer'], 'drink': ['coffee', 'water']}"

It is very similar to the nearby Banana Leaf (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/banana-leaf-philadelphia#hrid:yatXxKiQqS4CDWviDyUNZA ), which I was equally impressed by.  They are so similar in food, price, decor, that it is hard to distinguish them.  I will say, I think this place has a very slightly nicer decor.  But the decor is very similar--big, dark, and kind of open.  This place is a bit brighter, bigger, and more open, but still basically dark.  Prices are very reasonable.  You can eat for under $10 a person, and the quality is exceptional for this price range.

I came here with my dad; he ordered the Hainan Chicken, it was outstanding...very tender (steamed!) chicken on a bed of cucumber with some carrots, rice on the side, and a very flavorful sauce that was spicy, tangy, and had some interesting and novel flavors.  I had a fried rice noodle dish with egg, mixed seafood, and bean sprouts.  Both dishes were outstanding.

Service was good.

The menu here is huge, I really would like to come back and check out more of it.  The food is vaguely reminiscent in some ways to Thai food, but it has a more mellow flavor, less sweet, less sour, less spicy.  The only thing I found slightly lacking about the menu is that many of the dishes are a tad heavy on the carbs and meat, more so than, for instance, Thai food.  But they are still fairly balanced.

My only other complaint about this place is that I do not think that spiciness ratings correspond at all to the spiciness of the food.  My dish was marked spicy and had no noticeable heat or peppers in it, my dad's was not and his came with a sauce that had quite a kick to it.  Just so you know.

It doesn't take much effort to find it and my partner and I had too much fun walking through the building ogling the various design spaces and giggling at a few, especially the one with the sheep in the window (probably long gone).  The restaurant is located on the top floor.

I give two stars for the staff, decor and view.  Things that were actually very good.  So, kudos on getting that right.

The staff was extremely friendly.  Our server had a great sense of humor.  The chef was nice enough. The maitre d' was very accommodating and we had a nice little view even though all of the window seating was taken. Service was on the ball.

I wish I could give the food zero stars.  Why?  Though it was presented nicely I could tell just by looking at the potatoes that they'd been living under a heat lamp for a while.  When I tasted them they were bland and had the magical heat lamp taste to go with the bland.  The fish was not much better as it was severely under-spiced.  My green veggie was bleh. Boiling in water alone does not make for yummy green veggie.  Steaming this portion of the meal and tossing in something to give it a bit extra would have been good but no dice.

The cocktail? I was presented with a martini made with sweet vermouth.  I had the server return it and asked her to have the bartender make it with dry vermouth.  Really? A bartender who doesn't know how to make a classic martini?  I did not make a huge stink, just asked it be done correctly.  The bartender did come to our table later and apologize, without any prompting from me, which I appreciated.  I turned him on to Mr. Boston's, every bartender's bible.

The prices are over the top for what you get.  I could have made the same bland meal at home for 1/10 of the price we paid for our meals here.  Really, if you're going to charge first rate prices prepare first rate food and make sure your bartender has an ""old man drink"" cheat sheet.  Oh and, heat lamps are evil!

Wood Oven Salad (Toasted Parsnips, Carrots, Celery Root, Turnips, Prosciutto Cotto, Smoked Scamorza) - 2 out of 5
This is not a salad. There was no lettuce. I was expecting a vivid, earthy, and starchy salad, and received some hybrid of deli ham and a deconstructed antipasti. There are copious shavings of ham that form a bed underneath some under-seasoned, and overly greasy, unidentifiable root vegetables. I'm equally upset that this menu item is a misnomer and an oleaginous mess.

Crudo Pizza (Prosciutto Crudo, Bufala Mozzarella, Parmigiano) - 3.5 out of 5
The crust was perfectly crispy, soft, and stretchy dough that was flavorful. Vetri excels at making an A+ crust that is both doughy and comforting while simultaneously minimalist and light. The top of pizza was a bit oily and the mozzarella was cold. 

Cookie Jar (Pignoli, Almond Cookies, Chocolate Biscotti, Pistachio Gnocchi) - 4 out of 5
$5 affords you a small paper bag with two of each of the four aforementioned bite-sized cookies. The chocolate biscotti were one of the best biscotti I've tried. The chocolate was heavily pronounced and elevated, I'm presuming, by the addition of coffee. The pistachio gnocchi were positively irresistible: moist and teeming with rich pistachio flavor. I only wish there were more...

Ambiance - 3 out of 5
The space is smaller and the dining room shallower, than one would expect. There is limited seating and there are no plans to take reservations.  When new guests arrive through the entry, the swing of the door sends a rush of cold air throughout the dining area. The added outside entry doesn't do the best job to mitigate the problem. This is truly a casual joint; don't expect comfortable chairs. While we were seated at the bar, we noticed a steady flow of take-out orders.

We ordered poppers & mozzarella sticks for appetizers and they were the typical kind that you would assume came frozen in a bag, but they were good nonetheless. They both came with marinara sauce which was really flavorful and garlicky, which makes me think their entrees might be good. 

I ordered the roast beef sandwich, which was on the menu as coming with chips and I asked for fries instead. The waitress said the sandwiches come with fries now. I think they need to change the menu then. My wife got a stuffed burger with blue cheese and bacon with fries and our friend got the shrimp Caesar salad. My friend's salad looked really delicious and she finished every bite. My wife said her burger was really good. My roast beef with provolone sandwich was pretty good, but a little messy. The menu said sandwiches come on a kaiser roll and I was expecting a really good kaiser, but they were that general kind that you buy in bulk. The fries were those crinkle fries you get frozen in a bag. It would be nice if they made everything fresh on site or had some original food delivered.

Also I think they need to fix the windows... There's a huge crack in one of the large front windows that's being held with packing tape. One of the small top windows suddenly fell open at one point and my friend and I were scared it was going to fall and break on us when it fell open.

I would stop in again, but probably just for drinks and apps, just to hang with friends. I like that it's close and that the drinks are reasonably priced.

The foie gras soup was a creative variation, and replaced the traditional fruit flavor pairings with kaffir lime, asian pear, pumpernickel, and lemongrass.  The meatloaf was beef, pork, veal, and foie gras with a bacon tomato marmalade, and was an excellent choice as well.  The Singapore Sling dessert, a signature dish that was part of Chef Sbraga's win on Top Chef was fruity and refreshing, though more suited to the spring and summer seasons than fall or winter.  

Overall, it appears that the restaurant has been open for two years, not two weeks, as the meal was prepared and serviced exceptionally well.  My only gripe would be the somewhat cramped seating and loud volume, but both were easily tolerable and did not significantly detract from the evening.  The location is prime for theatergoers, and the large windows allow for people-watching, as well.  

Note:  the $45 pre-fixe menu is apparently offered both at the bar, and for table service.  The entire pre-fixe menu is also offered a la carte at the bar, but can be had a la carte at the table as well.  A nice option of flexibility, as I've seen many restaurants restrict the a la carte and/or pre-fixe options unnecessarily.  Each of the starter, fish, and meat courses had one ""special"" option that was available at a supplemental cost above the pre fixe.  

Overall, a great value and a place I'd definitely recommend and revisit.  They are considering a brunch service in the next few months, which would be worth a visit I'm sure.  Enjoy!",2011-11-02 14:07:50,"{'food': ['starter', 'fish', 'meat', 'dessert'], 'drink': []}"

A LONG time ago, they had freshly carved turkey and their roast turkey and brie was a delicious treat.  Then about 3 years ago they switched to the bland, processed, tasteless turkey.  After boycotting them for about 6 months, I came crawling back and continued ordering the roast (processed) turkey and brie.  
  Next, they cut down on the quantity of turkey in the sandwich (to match the reduced quality, I guess).  Another brief boycott and again, I came crawling back. 
  All this time, you could always tell when they had a new manager.  More than any other restaurant I can think of,  the change of manager was always obvious - sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.   About a year ago they had an outstanding manager- always out front of the counters, being sure all the customers were being helped, that the tables were clean, that the soda dispensers were working, etc.
  Well, the management for the past 6 months or so has gone from good to atrocious!  At least one of the soda dispensers is usually out of order.  The orderly lines to order either salad or sandwich, marked by signs over the counter, have disappeared, to be replaced by nothing but a milling group of customers not knowing where to stand to order what.  
   The final straw came on a Sunday about 2 weeks ago.  I went in about 12:30 PM.  There was nobody waiting, and only 2 or 3 tables of people eating.  I ordered the usual roast turkey and brie.  The guy acknowledged my order, then went to the cutting board and cut a flatbread into sandwich sizes.  OK, I thought, he's cutting my sandwich bread.  Well, then he took a second loaf and cut that.  Then he took a THIRD loaf and cut that.  When he started to cut the FOURTH loaf, I said, ""never mind"", and left.  He didn't even look up.
  That was the final straw.  I have NEVER found the help in this store to be, well, helpfull, but that was the award-winner.

We were seated immediately in the upstairs area, had menus right away, and a drink order placed within two minutes despite the buzzing crowd. Very nice! Sunday is a good time to stop by, as their ""Sunday School"" specials are excellent (both in price and selection). 

We ordered several small plates to start...roasted beets with feta, wild mushroom and raclette fondue, and butternut squash with bacon and goat cheese. All were very tasty, especially the fondue. I knew this place was special when the supply of toast for the fondue was dwindling, yet more fondue remained...I thought of asking for more toast, but was almost expecting some sort of ""umm, sorry, we can't blah blah"". The idea of eating fondue with a spoon crossed my mind when out of nowhere our server appeared with a plate of more toast. Without us asking. Bonus!

We then had a cheese plate (an Italian truffle cheese). It was soooo smooth and delish, and came with a little extra bit of squash...it allowed for a completely different, yet intriguing taste combination.

Now, this is a burger place. It's equidistant from both a Five Guys and a Shake Shack. It is priced similarly to both a Five Guys and a Shake Shack. It is better than both a Five Guys and a Shake Shack.

You really can't go wrong. You can make your own burger creation, they have a plethora of toppings to put on, you can get PRIME BEEF on your burger. Braised bacon? Eggs? Hash browns? You name it, they have it.

I had a prime beef burger cooked medium, with cheddar cheese, mayo, lettuce, onions, bacon, and an over easy egg. Life doesn't get any sweeter. My burger was moist, greasy, lots of cheese, just overall what I expect from a burger joint. 

I didn't try their truffle fries, but I wish I did. They smelled and looked so good. Maybe next time.

The reasons it is knocked down a star? It does take a little too long for your meal to come, the place is really small and incredibly loud at lunch, and it just doesn't really feel all that clean.

Bitars is a very unassuming place, despite the burgundy exterior and hookah-filled window. When you first enter it, it's almost hard to notice that it's both a market and a restaurant. That being said, the atmosphere is very cozy and reminds me of some of the places I went to get food in Israel. The store aspect of Bitars offers a wide variety of fresh and delicious products at a way better price than the supermarket conglomerates. The middle contains bins of fresh, delicious, and fluffy pita bread of all sizes; the coolers offer home made hummus, baba, tabouli, falafel, grape leaves, juices, delectable feta cheese and olives; and the shelves house a variety of spices and herbs that normally cost a bajillion dollars at Acme but are extremely reasonable. On top of that, they also have a dessert case that offers some of my favorite baklavah and halvah of all time. I'm not exaggerating in the least when I say that I was here religiously once or twice a week when I lived at 9th and Tasker buying their hummus, tabouli, and desserts. It's absolutely phenomenal. 

The grill part of the restaurant is equally as good. They offer a really good amount of both vegetarian and meat sandwiches, as well as delicious and big salads. I personally recommend the falafel, although you really can't go wrong with anything there. They are also willing to customize a bit so your sandwich or platter becomes exactly what you want. Unfortunately, it's probably better to get your food to go because it really only has two small tables in an already small room. 

Bitars really is one of the best gems that South Philadelphia has to offer. Their food rivals some of the bigger names in Middle Eastern cuisine, and their market selections give you the opportunity to create your own versions of traditional favorites. The owners have created a gold mine and you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not check it out.

It was mushy inside and it was some type of pasty sauce and onions. Not a piece of steak at all. I cut open my 2nd roll because I wanted to examine it and again no steak.

Cuisine:  The Prime Rib signature dish is hands down the best steak I've ever had (which is a list that includes the other big names in Philly, Del Friscos, Ruth's Chris, etc.).  The filet oscar was also exceptional when I had it.  Make sure you get an order of the crispy potato skins, they are delicious and one order is big enough for two.

In the past, my latte would be crowned with a 1/2 to 3/4-inch layer of thick, creamy steamed milk foam. It would be so dense that I could run a spoon through it and it would leave a fairly deep trail. 

But the last several times we've been there, there has been almost no foam - what foam there was consisted of a 1/16th to 1/8th-inch layer - and it was thin not only in depth but also density. I can make coffee with hot milk at home; I don't go to La Colombe for cafe au lait.

This has been extremely disappointing!

This review is more for the spa at the hotel:

The spa itself is actually more of a hotel gym area, a very nice fitness set up but more gym than spa. There's a small, good lap length pool for swimmers and ample cardio machines plus weight training machines. 
The ladies' locker room is nicely sized with a steam room and sauna to enjoy before your spa treatment. Plenty of towels to be had and comfy robes.
It's still a locker room though, accessible by hotel members there for the gym or the pool, so my particular visit was punctuated with small children and nursery music playing to entertain them. Not the peaceful atmosphere I prefer in my spa visits.
There's a quiet room with lounge chairs tucked in the corner of the locker room where I curled up to relax...until an employee popped through in street clothes and cursed when her key gave her trouble at the private access door. Not quite as quiet a quiet room as one might like. Also, as employees passed through, they focused on their cell phones and didn't even acknowledge, quietly say Hi, or even softly excuse themselves for disturbing people in the ""relaxation room"". The demeanor of the staff was casual to the point of rude.
Overall, this was a good combination of amenities to welcome guests of the gym, pool, or spa - but as a spa day goes...this is not the place to invest in for a day of pampering and unwinding.",2014-12-20 21:27:06,"{'food': [], 'drink': []}"

My friend recently took me for my birthday, and I immediately fell in love with it! Because we went on a weekday evening, there was no wait, but I am pretty sure that the wait time can be long if on a weekend due to the small size of  the restaurant.

We started off with the Truffled Egg Toast, which was delicious. Not too heavy with the combination of bread and cheese, and also has a unique flavor to it if you are not familiar with truffle. The pepperiness of the arugula cuts well with the bread and cheese. The Ricotta w/ Honey Bruschetta was just as good. Sweetness of the honey and creaminess of the ricotta on a crispy baguette was on point. The Duck salad (I forget the official name) was light, perfectly dressed, and meat was tender. We licked that plate clean. We also got one of the cheese plates, but I cannot remember the name of it. We ended the night with the Chocolate Espresso Torte, which was probably my least favorite dish of everything we had since I'm not a huge fan of rich, dense chocolate desserts in general, but with the honey mascarpone and hazelnuts, it was good. I'm glad my friend and I shared that thing - would not have been able to finish it myself.

That being said, the reviews about the prices here are true, and they could be a bit more transparent about how much they are charging for these beer-ha-has. Furthermore, many, MANY of the beers I've purchased recently have been expired, which is very disappointing, considering the price point. Why are you selling flat, expired beers to your loyal customers? Why not do a mystery box, ""grab bag"" sort of thing, where you put all of the expired beers in a cooler and sell them for $12 a six-pack?

The burger was well made and very juicy, but they skimped on the sauce and the bun was way too large. The fries were very good, but I didn't find anything remarkable about the duck fat.

We wanted something more substantial and less greasy, so we were happy when my sister suggested Pub & Kitchen.  Her friends had been raving about it and they served their full menu until 1 am.  

Food:  We ordered a lot at the table, the best part being I got to try it all.  And all of it was great. The most delicious gnocchi I've ever tasted (served with crab and vegetables); amazing wings in honey whiskey sauce (which are also probably the biggest bargain on the menu, a huge plate for $9); a great, perfectly dressed arugula salad with watermelon, mint and feta; and a hearty and flavorful burger.  If I had to choose a weak spot it would be the fries that came with the burger, a little soggy, but such a minor complaint.  Everything else was great.
 
Drinks: I had (okay several) mojitos, which tasted crisp and clean, with a generous amount of mint and not overdone on the sugar.  I also tried the sangria which was good but nothing to write home about.  Great variety of beers that the rest of the table chose from.

Service: From looking at the other reviews, it seems that service can be spotty.  But we had great service and a fairly attentive server.  It helped that the bar wasn't too crowded but I never felt like I had to wait for anything.

Grafitti/collage combined with dry ramen noodles being used as a wall decoration was just too flippin' adorable.

The ramen was brilliant as well.  It had such an interesting taste; it is a miso based broth but it had this flavor that was just so unique and worked so well.  Cheu poaches the egg instead of soft boiling and that was also a great touch and lets the egg mix infuse with the broth.

The Bahn Mi was also delicious and loved the spicy mayo as a condiment.  Unfortunately I have an aversion to cilantro and that ended up overpowering the dish.  If you love cilantro then you would probably love this.

On a recent trip back (this past Thursday) to Philly I decided to check out Vetri after reading reviews in GQ and the New York Times. I was not disappointed. My meal blew me away. 

The local farmer vegetable soup was good. The foie gras pastrami with fruit mustard was excellent. This dish is served cold along with artisan bread on the plate and the fruit mustard was basically a black raspberry preserve that perfectly complemented the pastrami of foie gras and herbs. 

Having the option of ordering a half portion of pasta allowed me to sample the fettuccine with octopus bolognese. This dish was very good and very light. For my own personal taste the dish was slightly over seasoned. I still enjoyed the dish and would order it again. 

The baby goat with polenta was very simple, yet very elegant. The dish consisted of only the goat and its crispy skin and two ribs served over polenta. This dish was extremely good. It may seem boring but the simplicity is what makes the dish top notch. 

Spinach gnocchi was very rich and very good. I could see how someone would not be able to finish this dish alone because of the richness. I've never had gnocchi so light in texture before, they were great. 

The Tuscan white and focaccia bread with olive oil and olives was available throughout the meal. 

For desert the blueberry doughnuts with blueberry gelato and stone fruit tart with almond gelato did not disappoint. The only complaint I can make is very minor; the blueberry gelato was a little too cold. 

Vetri also has a very affordable wine list with bottles as low as $35. 

Vetri turned out to be one of the best, maybe the best, food experiences I've had in Philadelphia.

The side of rice that came with this dish was delicious as well. It's not your regular rice. It's nicely seasoned and has a yellowish tint to it. I could probably just eat the rice by itself.

You walk into a fairly large square room, with a bar that runs across the back wall, tables across the front wall, and open space in the middle.  The bar is pretty cool, as it has two peninsulas that jut out, enabling a group to sit and face each other, as opposed to down a line at the bar.  Service for that could be quite annoying, as it requires the bartenders/servers to either slide the food/drinks down, or step around the bar and deliver it.  When you walk in, there's a broken jukebox directly in front of you, which I think is intentional.  The bar itself is a bit dark, but they have cool lightbulb lights hanging above the tables and bar.

Service was a bit slow, as it seemed there were only two people servicing the entire bar/restaurant at 11:30am, but it tripled by noon.  We sat at the bar, towards the end, and the bartended gave us menus and water.  Everyone we encountered with was pleasant, and they definitely seemed busy.

They have a fairly extensive beer list (draft and bottles), as well as breakfast drinks - I got a bloody mary and it was fine...nothing crazy and fairly standard.

Hudson Cakes - these were simple pancakes with a scrambled eggs and spinach mixture inside, and it was pretty good - the dish attacks your sweet and savory tastebuds, which is always nice.  There wasn't much to the actual dish, as the pancakes were pretty bland, but again, the simple sweet & savory profile of the dish made it tasty.

Veggie Cuban - other Yelper mention this was good, but I thought it was too salty/tangy...the pickle and the dijon dressing definitely overpower the entire sandwich.  The portobello mushroom isn't a thick patty, it's actually quite the opposite - it's a small sliver that you can barely taste, and it was a bit stringy/chewy.  Personally, I'd stay away.

I'm a sucker for biscuits and this one was completely undercooked and doughy...not a fan at all.

Overall, I don't think I'd come back for brunch, but the service was nice and I'd come back to check out the beer list.

First and foremost, cash is king at this restaurant and reservations are a must on the weekend so put that Open Table app to work. Second, this isn't your Olive Garden, restaurant chain Italian, this is the real deal. Rich and thick sauces, generous portions, desert to kill and take hostages for and a nice wine selection. Go here with your stomach empty and your palette ready for a tour de force. 

Great think about this restaurant was our servers, Elise (our man waitress and manager) and her assistant Monika both attended to us in making our date night a very special evening. By special I mean Elise's recommendations for dinner were right on the money (try the Vitello Monte Carlo and the Pesce Misto), assisted us with a little bit of Italian and suggested that amazing antipasto sampler for two. Don't skimp, you need that in your life. You have to ask for it because it's not on the menu. 

After dinner we had, as my girlfriend stated, true Tiramisu. And when it comes to sweets, I do not argue with her. Flat out, she confided in me that this was the best meal she's ever eaten. I couldn't say the same because I know my mother would some how appear from Seattle and strike me dead but I'd be hard pressed to find a rival to there cuisine. 

This is a total date night spot that would impress any lady and make you appear to have some culture. My only knock on this place is that it's a little too pricey not to accept credit cards but there's a cash machine in the back. Put this on your places to visit in Philly.

The price has gone up slightly but the food is consistently amazing.

The soon do boo is a soft, boiling hot bowl of soft silky tofu with your choice of veggie and meat, spiced from 1-5.  It always comes with a giant bowl of hot rice and a raw egg for you to put in the boiling tofu when you first get it.

The bonchon dishes here are numerous, you usually get a set of 6 for two persons, if you have 4 people you should get two sets of 6 bonchon side dishes.

Their other dishes are consistently good also.  I love the pa jeon (korean pancake) with scallions and squid.

The service is fast paced and more leaned towards ""asian"" style of service, meaning you shouldn't be shy to ask for things if someone doesn't fill your water or tea. They have a special little button that dings for service when you press it.

The tofu dishes are $10, with leftovers if you have a normal appetite, but a hungry person can probably finish a tofu themselves.

Different textures (soft, crunchy, etc.)  Different flavors (sweet, salty, etc.).  Incredible.  I was informed that the chaat he would make for me is ""basic,"" and on my next trip he would go ""crazy with the next chaat.""  My next visit?  This guy already knew I would come back!

The beef satay is a rich, spicy celebration of tender meat in your mouth, with a peanut sauce that takes no prisoners.

When I first moved into the area, this was one of the best Northern Italian restaurants in Philadelphia, easily the equal of ""Gallo Negro"".  There was only one problem.  The pianist/singer couldn't do either very well, but he tried so hard you could ignore the failings just for the food.   That was several decades ago and in the intervening time, the food/service/ambience/attitude etc. slowly went to the dogs (the opera singer was already at the bottom of the pile, so...) and became a 'NOT to go to' place.   Parking was a complete joke at the best of times and impossible at the worst,

So, they're gone.  Too bad.   However, just up the road (literally) is Maria's Ristorante which is just a dynamite place for super food, good-sized drinks, attentive staff and a generous parking lot.   The also do great pizza, but their specials are astounding!  It's what Casselli's wanted to be.

I understand this is sushi, and sushi comes at a price. But when you spend $60 for two people and still have to stop at Wendy's on the way to the movie theater afterward, the tiny amounts of food better be pretty amazing to be worth it. The $25 sashimi platter comes with precisely 15 small and pretty thin but artistically cut slices of 5 kinds of fish. Two were your standard salmon and tuna, and the other three were fluke, mackerel, and something like snapper or yellowtail, I don't quite remember. While the sushi here was marginally better than many less-expensive sushi restaurants, I'm not sure it was worth the price markup. For me, there's a threshold where, once sushi is reasonably good, I care more about being able to get full without breaking the bank over minute improvements in fish quality. 

That being said, the sushi here is pretty tasty (especially the spicy tuna maki and the mackerel sashimi). If you want to impress someone with a fancy sushi place and spend a lot of money in the process (I would guess ~$100 per couple to get full), then this is your place (or Morimoto, I guess).

Came in on a Friday night with my brother and ordered their two slice special and a drink. After a few minutes, we realized we never received a cup for our drink. No biggie, there was only one girl working the front counter so maybe they forgot. We reminded her that we ordered the special and got our cup. After we waited over 20 minutes three groups of people came and got their slices right away. We had to remind the front counter again about our order. She passive aggressively tossed the slices into the oven and shoved them our way. Not only did she forget our entire order - we also had to remind her every step of the way. She didn't even offer an apology or anything.

I've only been here two times, and each time I walk in I adore the ambiance. It's like being in your rich uncle's living room. Upscale but cozy because it's your uncle and you feel comfortable there. Uncle Steven Starr.

I wish Uncle Steve would turn down the heat in his upstairs section though. I sat up there and when they dimmed the lights I was relieved because I thought that would help with the heat but it did not. I felt like he was trying to get me to order more cocktails to cool down. 

The first time I was here I obviously had the Turkey Dinner. It just makes sense. And it was delicious, everything I was looking for. So when I came back even though I wanted the same thing, I decided to branch out. See how the classics were. So I had a burger. It was good, but really I've come to learn that in places like this it's their fun dishes that are usually done better. Take for instance the nachos. I loved that they were individually laid out so that each chip had an equal amount of sour cream, cheese, etc, except then it made me feel like I was getting ""less"" for more. And then the nachos were just okay. His El Vez restaurant predictably does them better. I did taste my lover's orecchiette with crab meat and it was definitely a better ordering choice! I had to restrain myself from just eating his plate.

I also had the Ruperts Escape Cocktail which was basically a mini pina colada. Delicious. Chugged it uncouthly in three swigs. 

I think the nicest thing about this restaurant (besides the comfy cozy scene) is that you can take a variety of friends here who have different food tastes and everyone can find something that they'll want to eat or drink.

Two friends and I decided to go one day that we all had off work, a 92 degree summer day. When we arrived we were turned off right away by the stifling heat, it was hotter inside than outside. Nothing is more disappointing than expecting the relief of AC only to be enveloped by an inescapable wall of heat. Anyway, we made our way to the counter and were greeted by a less than happy worker. (I guess I wouldn't be very pleasant working in those conditions either). When my friend ordered the chicken kabob she simply replied, ""Chicken?! Really?!"" rather sarcastically. If you don't want to cook chicken, don't have it on the menu...or get an AC unit. With that said I won't complain too much as we only paid $3/ea. for our meals.

The other side of the restaurant had a small store with various middle eastern products and treats. We were much too hot to stick around and get anything, but everything looked good and reasonably priced.

We waited outside where there were a couple small tables and chairs until the food was ready. We all ordered to-go. When we arrived at our destination we dug in. The food was surprisingly better than I expected, I ordered the gyro platter (Lamb/beef over lettuce and tomato). It came with hummus and tabouli salad which both tasted very fresh, all together with the pita, the flavors all worked together very nicely. The portion was also large and enough to leave us all full and happy.

We were greeted with smiles and the wait was nothing (5 mins) compared to other brunch places. Albeit this is a bar but the brunch game is strong my friends.

I definitely recommend getting the Bloody Mary. It's spicy and garnished with homemade pickled veggies. Your choice of vodka.

We ordered a chocolate, caramel donut for the table to try because it was $2 and it was ridiculous. Hot out of the fryer made it crunchy on the outside with a cakey inside and whatever goodness they garnished with was off the plate and devoured within seconds.

Kiddos ordered the chocolate chip pancakes  as well as eggs and sausage. The portions are enormous. The toasted sourdough that comes with egg dishes is superb and you can order as a side. The pile of seasoned fries are a crispy nice addition instead of home fries.

The stunner is the chicken french toast with sunny eggs, kale and cabbage slaw, and peppered maple syrup.

Food (8.5/10) = Ordered the ""500 burger"" with the truffle fries.  The meat is damn good.  So good, it stands on its own without any sauce.  Of course if you want to contaminate your burger with sauces, go ahead.  They gave me a white sauce and a pink one.  I can't remember what they were exactly.  The pink one was rather salty though.  The sauces were delicious though,...better than the average ketchup and mustard.  All the other components of the burger were great/fresh (the bread, lettuce, mushrooms, bacon, cheese).

Very nice.

Our waitress brought over a bread basket while we waited for our food. We were starved so we munched on the bread until our food came. It had to be the worse bread we were EVER served. It was hard and stale. We asked for another basket. The second came out warm and stale.
I am a pizza lover, so was excited to try the brick oven pizza that I remember raving about in the past. The oven that I remember burning brightly, was dim and shut down. We were told that they are working on getting a piece for it and they are now making the pizza's upstairs..so we went ahead and ordered 2 pizza and a few other dishes. As the dishes came out 1 by 1, the night proceeded to decline quickly. We got the beets salad and the mussels which were both ok. The cheese and meats board was the farthest from cured meats!! The braised short rib ravioli sounded so good that we couldn't wait to try. When we dug in, we were disappointed to find jarred sauce that clearly spelled preservatives!! Finally on to the anticipated pizza. We each picked up a slice but again to our dismay, it was a lifeless, jarred sauce, uncooked disaster. We called over our waitress that could have not been nicer and apologetic. We asked to speak to the manager. This was probably the worse part of the night if you can imagine. Very kindly we discussed all of our problem from the bread to the ravioli, to the oven, to the pizza. We told him that we were here before and not sure if management changed but maybe consider sticking to the dance party that was supposed to happen instead of advertising it as a restaurant. He picked up the bread and said ""yep it's hard"". He did not reply when asked what kind of sauce that was being used on the ravioli. And we picked up the lifeless pizza. We told him we were not paying for the following items. He just said ""ok"". Never an apology or anything! That is the basic fundamental of customer service.

Finally, today was the day.  My husband and I are fried chicken connoisseurs, so the whole idea of ""craft"" chicken was enticing.  I read the reviews and they ranged from ""this the best chicken ever"" to the flavor of the chicken being bland.  Since we are not lemmings we wanted to try out the chicken for ourselves.  

We ordered the chicken tenders, chicken wings, biscuit and 2 hand pies for the family.  My mom looked at the chicken tenders and said they looked burnt and she did not want any.  They were a little browner than I usually like but they were not burnt.  I have to agree with other reviewers,  the tenders were moist. the coating was fine but...it had no flavor!!!!!  I believe that is why they MUST sell the dips.   Now 50 cents is not much; however when you need the dip to have any flavor profile, they should at least give you one gratis!  Even McDonald's does that!   I have to admit the dips were awesome and the biscuit was very good but pricey at over $2.  My husband said the chicken wings were better then the tenders.

The best part of our meal was dessert.  I had the ""Not your Grandma's apple pie""  and the hubby had the chocolate peanut butter one.  Very good but not exceptional.

What he said:

I chose Tria when looking for an affordable yet classy restaurant to take my girl out for a date; it fit the bill perfectly.  While it may not match everyone's expectations for dinner as there are few meaty options, I didn't feel like it was lacking anything.  With the wide variety of ""snacks"" (i.e. appetizers) and cheeses, there was plenty to enjoy before having our salads, which were more generous than expected.

While I'm no expert on cheese or wine, there looked to be a huge variety of choices that would satisfy anyone interested in sampling new flavors.  The beer selection too was fantastic; I had never even heard of 4 Hands Brewing before today, but found their cherry brewed Saison to be excellent.  The Port Brewing Blend didn't pair so well with my salad, but that was more my fault that anything.  It was close to being a little to spice-heavy for my tastes, but I found it to be enjoyable.

Every appetizer we ordered was delicious.  The fennel roasted almonds were very flavorful (and affordable at 2.5$ for those watching their budgets).  The cured pork offered an interesting contrast of the spicy flavor of the pork and the sweet flavor of the pickled raisins.  Still, my favorite item ordered was my grilled asparagus salad.  I'm sure you've seen it a thousand times amongst these yelp reviews, but it's very good.  And the presentation of it too was awesome.  It was like a mountain of all the most delicious vegetables imaginable, and I have no idea how it even stayed up.

Tria was a fantastic experience.  In addition to the food, the servers were fantastic and very knowledgeable about the wines, cheeses, and various entrees. Maybe I've been stuck in State College too long, but this place met and exceeded my expectations.  5/5.

There are a number of things to like about Tria. The portion sizes and price for everything on the menu is very reasonable, and allows you to sample several items without spending too much.

All of our ""snacks"" were delicious, but the sauteed broccoli rabe bruschetta was definitely my favorite, the almonds were very flavorful, and the pork tenderloin sweet and tasty, I lreally oved the addition of the baby cilantro. It also paired very well with my Muscat Wine. Even the ""entrees"" are not really priced like such. Both of our salads were around $10, and larger than I expected given the price. Again, presentation was killer. As expected given the rest of the yelp reviews, the Asparagus salad was great, but I also really enjoyed my Salmon Salad, and thought I got a very good portion of Salmon (no skimping!).As others have said, the servers are great. Never hovering, but always on top of drink refills,  removing dishes, etc. 

Overall, I really enjoyed dinner here, and would definitely come back and recommend it. For all the above plus 2 glasses of wine and 2 glasses of beer, our bill came out around $65 (check groupon, we got a $8 for $15 coupon for our trip), very reasonable for the amount of food and alcohol we ordered! 4/5.",2012-06-06 16:36:30,

i made a suggestion that they should have eggs made to order next year and the manager and another server told me it was impossible to do and flagged me off. (I know from experience lots of small restaurants and culinary art schools make eggs to order). the restaurant has only twelve tables.

It's so radically different from normal American Chinese restaurants in terms of the dishes offered and the flavor of the food. It is Szechuan style and (although I speak without knowing) seems incredibly authentic to this style of ethnic cuisine. It's got a very relaxed atmosphere, and the waiters are bubbly and excited to serve you. I came here for dinner with 4 others. 

Appetizers: 
-Scallion Pancake - Flaky and airy pancake with a wonderful sauce
-Sweet and Spicy Cucumber - most incredible sauce I've ever had, some combination of garlic and ginger and nutty flavors that reminded me of Thai food. Complemented the sweetness of the cucumbers
-Dan Dan Noodles - Soooo good. Basic thin noodles, with a very light but savory sauce coupled with it
 Main Courses:
-Cumin Tofu - Really good. Strong cumin flavor... if you don't like cumin, stay away. The red chillies are not as hot or intimidating as they seem
-Eggplant with Garlic Sauce - Cooked to perfection. I thought the sauce lacked complexity in flavor that other sauces here had, but it was still great
-Tofu Crispy Rice Style - Really not good at all. The tofu was leathery, and the sauce was not flavorful at all, and tasted a little weird. Came with these rice krispy treats that I didn't think went with the dish well from a textural standpoint. Steer clear.
 Dessert:
-Mochi - The Lychee Mochi had a strong lychee flavor that I found excellent, Triple Chocolate Mochi was superb, and Raspberry White Chocolate Mochi tasted a little bit like a strawberry milkshake from McDonald's strangely enough, but was fantastic regardless. Don't love the texture of Mochi, but these were worth giving a shot.

One big thing is that they feature GLUTEN-FREE crepes!!!! As a gluten-free person for over 5 years, I have never had better gluten free crepes. I have never had any gluten-free crepes in the city at all. These were insanely delicious. I had nutella and banana. It was cooked to perfection, crispy in all the right places, ooey-gooey in others, lightly browned, with dusted powdered sugar. The other crepe we ate was savory--egg, mushroom, and herbs. This was simple and done perfectly. We devoured both.

The guy who waited on us was extremely kind, hospitable, and gracious. He was knowledgeable about the gluten-free crepes. The whole check was pretty inexpensive considering how pricey fancy crepes can be. We spent $18 ish on two wonderful crepes with great fillings. We would have happily paid more.

Always fun to try the different coffees and expand your horizons.

We got together to celebrate my husbands 31st birthday and I wanted to take him somewhere different and exciting. Insert Marrakesh, a little Morroccan spot right off of South Street.

When we got there, we were invited to wash our hands as a group and were given towels for our laps as there are no utensils given. I love the atmosphere, the music and if you go with open minded people who don't mind close quarters and sharing a meal, you will enjoy it.

The Food.... OMG The Food!

For starters we had the salad trio, which was tomatoes and cucumbers, carrot salad and eggplant which came in on the expressway from heaven! It was delicious!

The second course was the Phyllo dough stuffed with egg and chicken topped with powdered sugar. I was not a huge fan, but everyone else loved it.

The third course was a whole chicken with olives and various spices, well seasoned and falling off the bone. 

Fourth, we enjoyed lamb and almonds in a honey sauce, and of course they kept the flat bread coming.

The fifth course was couscous and chicken with potatoes and carrots, and the sixth course was a bowl of fresh fruit. LITERALLY.

The followed it up with mint tea and baklava for all.

During the meal, a belly dancer came out and each of us took turns dancing with her, having a great time. The staff was friendly and because it was our first time, they took the time to explain the entire ""Marrakesh experience"".

My only complaint, is that they need to have a Vegetarian option. We had one vegetarian in our midst and they brought out a spinach pie for him during the chicken course, and they brought him hummus and chips during the lamb course, and they made a plate of couscous without chicken for him, which was nice.

However, if they come up with 6 truly vegetarian dishes patrons could still have the Marrakesh experience without meat, while TRULY sampling Moroccan style food.

Just a suggestion.

I ordered japchae, my fella had a dolsot.

We popped into Tria after putting our name in for a table at Mercato down the street and told there'd be an hour wait.  I was secretly hoping this was the case because I wanted to come to Tria for drinks.  

When we walked in, my husband was carrying a 6 pack of beer that we had planned to bring to the restaurant.  He asked if it was OK that we brought it in, not wanting to be rude.  Not only did they give us the OK, but they graciously offered to put our beer in their refrigerator until we left.  We were so shocked at just how nice and accomodating the staff was, which in retrospect seems silly.

We stood at the bar, but were quickly alerted by the bartender to a couple of free stools at the opposite end after we ordered our beers.  I ordered the Allagash White, which is not the most brave choice, but it was my first time having it and it was delicious.  I cannot for the life of me remember what beer my husband ordered, but I know he really enjoyed it.  Mary, our bartender, was very helpful in offering her tips and suggestions.  For our second round, my husband decided to try the mead they offered because he'd never had it. He didn't care for it all that much, but I think that's more due to his own over-hyped expectations:)  I had a glass of Prosecco which was exactly what I expected, delicious.  For my husband's last drink, he had a pint of the Southern Tier Pumking, which was on special for $3/pint.  We had previously had it by the bottle and didn't much care for it.  It was FAR superior on draft.  I admit that I had more than my share of his beer.

On a tour of of old haunts in honor of my husband's recent birthday we decided to stop by despite being a bit super partial to the old residents. We were actually quite impressed with the renovations and the new vibes! 

The place is super hip and obviously inspired by music. I loved the photos of my old pals Janis and Jimi downstairs, and certainly the guitars and old school blues concert posters on the walls upstairs in the ""juke joint"". 

We came for date night and enjoyed live music by  Big Soul Chicken band. (Check their site for a listing of upcoming performers.)They were awesome and played their original tunes as well as classics we all know and love. Perfect place to come whether you want it as background music or more of a concert/dancing type of night. 

 While the ""juke joint"" wasn't nearly as nitty and gritty as the authentic ones I've been to on the back roads in Mississippi and in the south in general, it certainly gave me a bit of that area I desire from time to time. There's not enough live music places in the city in my opinion. Let alone free to enter ones! This place is a great find! 

It's super groovy, dark and sexy feeling up in the juke joint. Lots of candles and even a fireplace. Perfect for a night out with my love! 

The cocktails were awesome and ran about $26 for two before gratuity. We chose the Lynchburg Basil Lemonade (Jack Daniels, Fresh Basil, Homemade Southern Lemonade) and the Black Cherry Gimlet (Black Cherry Vodka, Vanilla, Lime, maraschino Cherry). I honestly cannot choose a favorite! Both were carefully crafted, alcohol filled and absolutely delicious! Whiskey and Bourbon are obviously their specialty and I really loved the barrels scattered about doubling as side tables! The beer list was rather extensive also! 

The menu, like the entire place, is influenced by the South. They have a late night menu, kids menu, brunch, lunch and dinner. We can't wait to return perhaps for brunch with the kids or ""social hour"" as they call it. There's daily specials during that 5-7pm period with $4 wines, $3 brews and $4-$6 smaller plates. The mushroom and kale salads were calling my name and the crawfish Mac and cheese sounds right up hub's alley.

But they've only been open for a week, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Things are usually either too salty, too bland, or too spicy. Not a bit fan. If you want a novel on why, read on, or else stop right here and move on.

I have personally never been to their Fishtown location, but according to the staff, this place has a more expended menu. The location recently opened up (last week as of the intial posting of this review) from the remains if a Chinese takeout place. There's two floors. The ordering area is on the first floor, additional seating is on the second floor, along with the restrooms. The entrance way is a bit narrow and the lower level can be a bit cold on wintery days as the doors can get open by the breeze of patrons opening the front door to go in and out. Second floor seating is recommended for those looking to eat in. The logo is apparently based off of Boss Tweed, if you are wondering. 

I went a few times before their official opening week (this week). I've tried their burritos, tacos, platter, and chili. Overall the taste is flavorful, not too rich (or salty). Your order is freshly prepared, so its nice and hot, if it doesn't end up sitting in the counter for a while. The overall quality varies. I've had the fish burrito and the beef tacos with hard-shell tortillas (very rare to have in most taco places in  the area). Sometimes the meat comes out all greasy. This affects the overall taste and is a bit of a turn off for some people, like me. The tortillas shells were also stale on the taco I got and the toppings were missing as well. I usually eat in, but this time I got tacos for take out, so I didn't realize until I got back of the problem. Needless to say, for a pair of tacos at $7, I was pretty disappointed.

I gave them another chance on their official opening week and tried their whitefish platter. At $11, it was a bit underwhelming. The platter came with two decently-sized pieces of freshly fried fish, on a bed of house-made rice, with roasted corn on the cobb, slathered with their special sauce. It tasted good and fresh overall, the fish lacked seasoning, but it's how I like it. Not to salty and not too rich (or greasy this time). The portions were sized well, but I feel that the kernel should have been portioned off the cobb, for easier eating.

This place has a chili as well. Its $5 for a cup, but it's more like a dry stew than a chili. Despite its name it very thick and dry, there seemed to be big chunks beef and there along with beans so its very hearty. It's not as soupy as you would expect from most places. The taste overall was a bit saltier and richer than I like it. The seasoning wasn't too strong, but the spiciness was on the low-end. Barely any kick, so it might disappoint those that looking for a bit of an edge.

One more try with the Tijuana Poutine. It was salty. Not just regular salty, but I-should-find-something-to-wash-my-mouth-out kind of salty. Not due to the fries or the pickled jalapeños. What was the cause you ask? It was the Macho Chili (it wasn't as salty the last time I tried it). If you get this starter, a drink is HIGHLY recommended. The saltiness wraps around your mouth so much that you can't even taste the rest of the stuff. The egg doesn't add to it at all, it feels more like a decoration than anything. The portion was big, but very disappointing. 

Their ""Mexican Soup"" or rather Minestrone Soup with Chorizo was overly spicy. While I can handle some spice, the amount of spiciness was overpowering and detracted from the taste of the soup. It's a spiciness that creeps up on you the more you eat it. It detract from the overall taste as the more you eat the less you'll be able to taste the soup. Soda or juice is not a recommended compliment to the soup as it ruin the balance, like if you tried to wash out the bitter taste of straight up spoon of tabasco with Coke or Sprite. This side is not a good paring with any dish or as a standalone. Milk Bubble Tea from iTea will help you wash the taste out, if the spice is too much for you.

Service overall is friendly, but the quality can be inconsistent, especially around the lunch rush. The taste varies wildly to the point that I question what the all those chefs in the kitchen are doing. The lead chef should at least taste a portion of what comes out. 

Those looking for good ""Mexican"" fare might be disappointed, but if you're looking for a somewhat healthy freshly made meal, and don't mind things things fried, this place is a decent choice. It definitely fills a niche for tacos, burrito, and the like. Worth a try if your hungry and want to try something different. It's certainly different from your typical taco/burrito place.

I checked in with Yelp and a friend who visited earlier, and the general ""warnings"" I got were that a) the portion size was small, b) fries were salty, and c) the burger tended to stray toward the rare side of the spectrum.

Turns out only one of these would turn out to be true for me. I came in at 6pm on Saturday and the place was pretty empty and ended up waiting 5 minutes tops for my order. Total came to $18 and some change for 2 ""500"" burgers + 2 truffle fries, about what I'd pay at Five Guys for the same (jr. size) + drinks.

I briskly walked home and opened my prize. You know it's a good sign when the receipt stapled to the bag has grease on it. The burger was solid, juicy, cooked to order (medium rare), and as someone mentioned on here already, held up well and didn't fall apart on me. I tend to like my burgers on the rarer side, so any undercooking would have been welcome. In terms of taste, while not having the robust flavor of my all-time favorite burgers (Shake Shack, In & Out), the thing was damn good. The bacon was just right, though I feel as though it could have used a little more cheese.

As an aside, for some reason, the yelp photos make the burgers look smaller than they actual are. I was expecting something just a tad bigger than a slider, but I pulled it out of the bag and was surprised by the heft.

Now comes the part where the warning came true. The truffle fries were so good I scraped the bottom of the bag for every last remnant....BUT, they were salty as hell. In fact, as I write this, I feel dried out and keep licking my lips. I like salt, but damn, this was a lot!

By the end of the meal, I actually felt full...not bursting at the seams, but a comfortable full. While not the absolute best burger I've ever had, this place holds its own and is a welcome addition to the Philly burger scene.",2010-03-27 23:47:10,"{'food': ['burger', 'fries'], 'drink': []}"

Buuut....as Pub & Kitchen it has been getting so many good reviews, we knew we had to try it. And it was pretty good. 

We didn't have to wait for a table when we arrived (around 6:45), (but no reservations, so any later we probably would have had to wait). We were seated in a small table in between the two sets of booths. We immeadiately deemed these tables awful and just a way to make a few extra bucks. We were in everyones way and people kept banging into us and it was kind of awful. 

Overlooking that, we ordered 1/2 oysters, which had a great little sauce and hubs ordered fish and chips and I had the Chicken Confit. 

The hubs died for his fish and chips and cleared his plate entirely. Two huge pieces of deep fried fish, skinny fries and mushy peas (ew IMO). My chicken was pretty good, although fairly oversalted, but the parmesan polenta and stewed tomatoes were delish! 

They also carry our favorite UK brew, Old Speckled Hen, so that was a plus. 

Another plus: The music!! It was perfect: Beatles, Elton, The Police, Tom Petty. The music made it feel like it was still Chaucers. 

The strangest thing though: There were too many staff. It seemed like there was at least one staff for every three or four costumers and it was fairly offputting...They were the worst culprits when it came to banging into our table.

That's a pretty sweet deal. Dan and I stopped in here on a lunch break from work. We picked up a few beers from the Foodery and stopped by.

The spot is tiny, but nice. there are about ten tables across the dining area with a small, open kitchen. The walls are brightly painted, and there are several other endearing decorations. I don't usually go crazy over atmosphere, and one shouldn't expect anything from a place on 5th and Girard, but the decor is well done.

I don't want to make a blanket statement about the service but here are two of my observation's: Las Cazuelas and the Abbaye share some staff, to my chagrin. Second, my first choice on the menu wasn't available (the last two were served moments before). I'm not a restaurant manager, but running out of a dish before lunch (let alone dinner) is finished seems to be problematic. One plus are the free chips and salsa verde as soon as you sit down.

The food came out quickly. I ended up with a dish with rice and pan-seared shrimp, along with caramelized mixed veggies. Everything was acceptable, but I can't rave about anything. The portions could have been a bit bigger. Dan went with marinated beef tips, with refried beans and avocado. He said that the meat wasn't the best cut, and it marinade could have been improved upon. Neither of us could remark about anything other that the fact that we were getting a ""good deal for the money.""

For our drinks, we picked up Rouge's Chili Ale, which had a great pepper taste that didn't overpower. It was a great way to start our meal. We had the Hot Rock lager from Port Brewing to finish, which was a solid, but not outstanding, lager.

Bottom Line: I'd prefer not to bash a place that is offering such a great deal. I like the initiative to get in new customers. But with a plethora of good Mexican spots, one of my favorites only a few blocks a way, I can't see myself ever going back here.",2009-11-11 22:16:11,

My twitter feed is constantly blowing up with people meeting up and checking in at KPP and I can see why. With an extensive beer list in addition to their rotating specials and a uniquely vegetarian friendly down home Southern-ish menu they've got something for everyone, including MEEEEEE. On Friday night I went for the vegan fried chicken po' boy, which consisted of a large roll filled with what I believe to be breaded seitan chunks (the ""fried chicken""), what I believe to have been vegan mayo, some other spread (perhaps a mustardy remoulade), lettuce, tomato and pickle slices which added a tangy, vinegary crispness to the sandwich. A crucial element. They also have pear cider (and regular ol' hard cider) available in the bottle, which is nice for me since I'm not always interested in drinking actual beer, but want something other than my stand-by diet soda. 

Elizabeth B. and I are known to split the always PIPING HOT fried green tomato appetizer here, which comes with the same mustardy remoulade found on the po' boy.

Let me first start by saying the $45 pre fix price is a steal and I left extremely satisfied.  I did opt for the wine paring although I wouldn't do it again as the pours were not worth the extra $25 (note: one of my plates was the chicken ""hot wings"" plate which they paired with a beer.  I understand that nothing goes better with wings than beer but if I am paying for a wine pairing I do not want a beer substituted)  Other than that small issue this was one of the better meals and service experiences I have had in the city this year. 

 I started with the Foie gras soup and it lived up to the hype.  The portion was spot on as this is a rich soup and can become rather filling towards the bottom of the bowl.  I then opted for the scallop and Pork Belly which was delicious but also the most tame and mainstream of the four courses.  The chicken and Brussels sprout dish was the star of the night for me.  This is a take on a hot wing with young chicken and a home made hot sauce severed table side in a small squeeze bottle.  It was delicious and I can see myself visiting again just for this dish!  

My girlfriend started with the Cesar salad which was pretty standard but well executed which was followed by the take on fish and chips.  This was delicious as the fish was not greasy and accompanied by a delicious twist on Tatar sauce.  For her main course she had the Meatloaf which was very well seasoned and contained several different flavor profiles.  For desert we selected both cocolate options and both were excellent.

I must say the highlight of the night (keeping in mind we went on a Monday) was Kevin's presence in the kitchen.  We sat at the kitchen counter which I recomend and Kevin was asking us how everything was ect....What was really cool was that after the meal Kevin came over and chatted with us for around 10 min about the Philadelphia food scene and where we liked to eat out.  It was refreshing to see someone that has a fairly high profile take time to BS with my girlfriend and I. 

We were also comped a free apitizer by the kitchen which was the lamb chop and lamb belly - really great.  I will definitly be back and might even post up at the bar for a drink and a plate of the chicken!

First of all, they have the BEST guacamole!  I am obsessed with it!  I usually go for the Guacamole 9 where you can make your own with selections available on a checklist.  One thing I always make sure I get in my guac is crab.  Its an amazing, flavorful and rich addition that you have to try!  Then I usually get cheese, cilantro, tomatoes and several other small additions!  I try to vary this combo every time I come, but I always get the crab!

Usually when I come here, I come with a friend or two and we share a few dishes.  The Pollos Frito, Braised Short Rib, Chipotle Back Bay Ribs, and Vegetable Enchiladas are among the staples that we usually order.

I also really enjoy the Short Rib Tamale, Mushroom Tamale, and Fried Plantains.

The spicy brisket Tacos and the Fish taco are certainly worth a try as well!

I also enjoy doing the tequila flights.  Often if I am just with one other person, we will order one flight and share the sots because they are pretty big!  I am not super knowledgeable about tequila, but the staff certainly knows what they are talking about when they explain what everything is.

Portions are an okay size.  Not too small, but not large either. They are also a bit overpriced.

What I found was a very cool, fun, fresh take on a noodle bar and I'll be returning.

The space here is a bit tight and most likely you'll have a wait on a Friday or Saturday evening.  We chose to wait it out at Varga (conveniently located down the street) while our table cleared out.  It didn't take terribly long before we were at our seats and ordering.

I was very impressed with the black garlic wings.  Heat and sweet were the tastes that hit my mouth but I did feel the dish was put together nicely.  The wings were cooked perfectly and it wasn't too sauced.  It had just enough to leave a nice impression.  The dumplings (potato, egg, cheese, chili oil) were not my favorite due to the filling combo, but I would not be opposed to trying more of their dumplings (if they change).

The star for me was the lamb neck hand torn noodle dish.  The spice on the lamb was killer, and it was falling apart while I tried to eat it.  The mustard greens and dates brought those other flavor punches that made this dish truly excellent.  I would come back and eat here just for this.

The spot is fun, the music is great (I heard mostly A Tribe Called Quest) and the kitchen worked really well together in the space they have.

However after another ten minutes of waiting, mind you it is no one else there but me at the front counter. She answers the phone, WTF... (Ready to walk out).
    The cook must have seen my frustrations because he stepped in and asked What would I like to order. I ordered the cream chipped beef over rye toast and it came with the side of home fries. He was pleasant and made my order promptly, about ten minutes later he asks the cashier to rung up my order. It was just something with her, she never smiled and nor even at this point acknowledge me. She just stated what I owed, then hands me my change. No thank you or have nice day. Nothing! So the smarty pants I am I said... Thank you, you enjoy your day. Again nothing. I am done. 

I work in a customer service driven field, I know how important is to make a good first impression also how to make some one feel welcomed. Make me feel like you want my business. The more welcome I feel the more money I spend.(especially if the food or product is worth it) DUH. Its just practical common sense. 

One a good note the food was amazing. I even loved the home fries with out any extra condiments or salt/pepper. The potatoes had a little crispness on the outside, not too firm but not mushy on the inside. The entire meal was properly seasoned to my liking. It could have been an off day for the cashier I will give her that.

General Tso's wings.  Delicious.   Just the wasabi blue cheese sauce is enough to to give it a 4 star rating.

Blue Duck Fries - love the duck confit with the smoked Gouda cheese sauce.   It brings fries to a whole new stratum

Duck Benedict - eggs were a bit on the runny side but the sriracha Cherry hollandaise makes it fabulous.

Duck a l'orange- thin pancakes with duck and blood orange syrup.   This was good but not as good as the other things, but then I like thick pancakes.

Nonetheless I will be back to try other things on the menu.

But what really counts is how well they prepare the food - and they delivered. We had cobia, ramps and asparagus, stuffed quail, roast chicken, and pork loin and belly. Each thing was perfectly prepared and we practically licked each plate clean. The best was the quail, with a close second for the chicken. (The chicken was more surprising though, because who would've thunk that chicken could be that good?)

The service was very good, as our server knew the menu well and was able to expertly advise. She was also very friendly. However, she was not quite as attentive as I would have liked. At one point, we had finished our first bottle of wine (which she already knew was running low) and we had to finally call the hostess to open the wine because we hadn't seen our server for a while. I know that is a bit nit-picky, but I could see why others have knocked their service a bit. But, as I said before - they shined with their menu knowledge and advice, which is the most important thing for their type of menu.

My boyfriend and I had a 6:30 reservation before a PIFA event and were running late. I told my boyfriend to call the restaurant and warn that we would be a little bit late. We arrived around 6:40 and the hostess thanked us for the call. We were seated immediately! 

I typically keep my reviews pretty short so I'll say that the lighting at the restaurant was more dim than I would have liked. The dining area itself seemed pretty spacious and not cramped, but this is probably just due to the fact that there weren't many customers there. The staff was friendly and answered questions I had about the menu. 

I went with the Classics menu (appetizer, main course, side, and dinner). I ordered the steak house salad as my appetizer and a whole garden arrived on a plate. I didn't care for the ginormous size or taste of the salad. I went with the sauteed mushrooms for my side. These were decent. My main course was comprised of the 6 oz. filet and shrimp. The shrimp were a little dry but the steak thankfully was great and cooked to my preference. When I'm at a nice steakhouse I never ask for any kind of sauce for my steak and luckily my filet was great without the addition of any sauce. I didn't care for the dessert (there is only one option) but I think it's just because I don't like raspberries or chocolate cake. I could have easily just asked for a small bowl of vanilla ice cream. 

I'm glad I had a LivingSocial coupon.

First, I ordered a highball after reading a compelling article on them in Bloomberg Pursuits. I had to wave the bartender down after sitting at the bar, ready to order for 10 minutes. With my menu closed. You would figure that a bartender that takes his craft seriously and works at an establishment with WHISKEY in its name would be experts in all things whiskey, but he didn't and quizzically asked to see my ID upon my obscure order. I had to tell him how to make the drink- it was mediocre. 

I then ordered a burger medium rare with cheddar and jalapeño bacon, which took about 40 minutes to come out. When the burger finally came out, I had to wait another 2 minutes to get the bartender's attention for ketchup. When I finally bit into the burger, it was well overcooked and tasteless. I struggled to eat 3/4 of it and finally put the burger down because it was unsatisfying, to say the least. I did not even bother to complain, as I did not want to spend another 40 minutes waiting for another meal tonight. 

I came here hungry and thirsty, and left without either. For the wrong reasons. This meal was underwhelming. The bar tenders were more focused on washing glasses and dishes than tending the bar. I did not leave a tip because neither food nor service deserved it. I have never given someone a $0 tip before and my standard tip is 20%.

Yes, that's right, Honey's expertly marries the artery clogging cooking techniques of Eastern European Jewry with the fry-everything mentality of the Southern States to create the best comfort food in Philadelphia.

Breakfast and brunch are Honey's signature meals with a vast menu of egg and french toast related options, but truth is that's its great for any meal with enough variety to keep your life spicy. This is the place I would eat everyday if only ""eating-healthy"" was defined as ""consuming huge portions of delectably fried foods"". The vibe is mellow and the prices are reasonable.

While a bit off the beaten path in Northern Liberties, there is regularly a wait for a table at brunch/lunch times. The solution if you don't like waiting is either to come later in the day or put your name in and then head down the block to the The Random Tea Room & Curiosity Shop (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-random-tea-room-and-curiosity-shop-philadelphia) to browse and sip some tea to pass the time. Honey's will call over when your table's ready.

Highlights not to be missed include the fried green tomatoes and the melt in your mouth biscuit that is good enough to make you surely question the lack of biscuits in your life up until this point. Pretty much everything on the menu is good, and what's not to like about a place where matzo ball soup and latkes live side by side with chicken fried steak and mac and cheese. Also there are rumors surrounding their amazing deserts, but I wouldn't know since I have never had room left to even look at a desert menu.

All you really need to know about Honey's can be summed up by a conversation I overheard on my last visit. A couple walked in and the hostess said, ""Oh, didn't expect to see you tonight"" to which the couple replied, ""Yep, third night in a row"".",2009-03-12 01:16:23,

We visited on a Friday night around 10:00pm and the place was fairly deserted; I would guess that there were 2 or 3 other tables occupied with a couple of people at the bar. We were looking for a little food to sop up some of our preceding revelry, and I had read that Slate had a top-tier burger. 

The standout of the evening was definitely the service. Our waitress was very casual and had the demeanor of a server at your local bar who considers you a regular. She would chat with us while we waited for our food, she recommended alternatives when we ordered a dish or drink that she considered to be inferior to another menu selection, etc. All in all, we really enjoyed her. 

Alas, the low point of the evening, for me at least, was the food. I ordered the Slate burger (I had to ask about it because it wasn't on the menu, so they brought me the bar menu, which contained it). I was super excited to try it to see if it could match up to Village Whiskey or even Bobby's Burger Palace. 

No. No, it did not. The burger, which was certainly sizable, came out on a somewhat-oversized potato-ish bun with no lettuce, tomato, onion, or even ketchup (unless the ketchup they gave me, which I inferred was for the fries, was for the burger [in which case I had no ketchup for my fries]).

The broth was very thin and not silky. It was bland and not salty or savory enough. The pork was not cooked in a pot roast style but instead fired with a torch, which gave am unusual burnt and chewy texture rather than something soft and buttery like normal tonkotsu pork dishes.

Our server Erica was such a doll, walking us through the entire menu, giving wonderful suggestions on what to order upon hearing of our first time.

The good:
THE MEAT: both SO and I ordered rare steaks, mine was the surf & steak special for $49 (included slightly too-charred lobster tail and rare filet mignon). I did enjoy the non-charred bits of lobster and my steak, which was succulent, juicy and hiding a hint of sweetness (although a bit more pepper/rub would've been great) whereas SO thoroughly enjoyed his porterhouse (both sides bringing out separate textures, the bone adding in a caramelized tone of flavor)
OVER his steak- SO took Erica's suggestion and got the truffle butter- definitely made his meal. If you're on the fence, GO FOR IT. You won't be disappointed!
SIDE DISH: we opted for the creamed spinach which was another excellent suggestion by Erica. Unlike other places where the spinach is too rich that you're feeling icky after the 3rd or 4th bite, Morton's had hints of nutmeg but was made so that you didn't feel too heavy afterwards. Definitely a good accompaniment to our meal
DESSERT: Thinking we were too full afterwards but unable to say no after Erica wheeled out the sweet choices, SO and I split a carrot cake. Absolutely the right choice! It's rich with carrot shavings on the side, a tall 2 layer separated by cream, made right. SO and I fought for bites and I took it to the next level, washing it down with a Kahlua/coffee.

The eh:
Lobster bisque- don't get me wrong, it's tasty but felt like it was missing something. I quite like Ed's Chowder House, where each spoonful is almost too rich to stand whereas Morton's tasted almost healthy, lacking in the full-on flavor punch of each bite

As far as steakhouses go, Morton's definitely delivered, cut of meat, sides and dessert although I'll definitely be passing on the seafood flavors.

We arrived on time but had to wait for our seats for about fifteen minutes.  I kind of like seeing that because it means that diners are enjoying their time at the restaurant and want to hang out for a bit.  The hostess offered prosecco to those of us waiting, which was a nice gesture.

The tasting menu was definitely much more than the expected five courses.  We weren't exactly counting (until we looked back upon the meal) and were just focused on the food, but we stepped out very full!  For the amount of food and the quality of ingredients, the meal was very much worth the money.  There was also a candle for us at the end of the dinner for our anniversary.  But although the experience was lovely, nothing really stood out, except for this one pasta...but even now I cannot recall what it was (just that it tasted delicious).

The food was simple and straightforward as I'd hoped, but it was so uncreative.  What I mean by this is that 1/3 of all the dishes had brown butter as its sauce.  So it wasn't really sauce but just pasta dredged in brown butter.  Also I'm very fond of the milk solids, but it was mostly the clarified butter that was in the plate :(.

Typically the food is good and arrives (delivery) within 40-60 minutes max.  This is fine.  Two weeks ago our experience was to this level, though the fries seemed to be bottom of the frier (literally) as we received mainly ""bits"" of fries, most of which were hard and only shells.  We also attribute this to being Friday night, as our other orders were during the week.  Today (Monday), I got home from work and my g/f and I were rather hungry.  Instead of running to the grocery store and cooking, we decided to order from Slices.  This was at 7:40pm.  It's now 9:20pm and we're both still hungry.  I had to call them and they could not tell me if our food has left, but said it would be ""20 minutes"" 'til we receive the food.

6. Salt and Pepper Shrimp Rolls: Filled with actual whole jumbo shrimp and served with a delicious dip.  This is unique to Jasmine Rice so highly recommend trying.
7. Papaya Salad: Good but not differentiated from the other versions.

I continued savoring my burger and quickly forgot about the fries, no big loss in bad fries right? So as I went to take a third sip from my soda I realized that although it felt heavy it was already void of any soda, I peeked inside only to find it almost filled to the brim with ice.

Everything ordered was delicious, and I'm dreaming about the sweet potato and cactus taco and the chicken fried seitan. They have so many vegetarian options but not too many vegan options, which is disappointing. 

Our server was extremely accommodating for my vegan friend's requests. My friend, Erin, wanted enchiladas, vegan. The server told her that the enchiladas couldn't be made vegan so the burrito would be a better vegan option. Erin told her she really wanted enchiladas, and the server said ""okay, I'll work it out.""  She ended up having some kind of veggie enchilada and was happy.

Service was a little slow at times, but she had the entire back section to herself on a Saturday night, so it was understandable. Besides, the fact that she was so nice about the vegan thing made it really hard for me to be irritated about speed.

Chicken was cubed, chewy and lacking spices.... as was the rice it was laying on. Hummus? The exact same flavorless disappointment as the chicken. No.Flavor.Whatsoever. I was hoping the garlic sauce would help me ignore the frustration that was my platter......until I realized the garlic sauce was made with mayo. MAYO, people!! I nearly cried. What a freakin' sin.  The best thing on my plate you ask? The 2 little grape leaves sadly sitting atop a small garden salad. They were pretty lackluster, but after the atrocity that was the rest of my platter...my palate welcomed a little flavor.  The small salad was served with a container of generic oil/vinegar dressing.

To start off, the Indian pancakes with the curry sauce is a great pick. For the meal, which is normally family style, I absolutely recommend the curry chicken, peaking duck, the seafood lo mien, and for your vegetable, the watercress with garlic sauce. Also, if you're a soup fan, I recommend the wonton me (one of the best soup and noodle combos I've ever tasted). White or brown rice comes with most of the dishes, so you'll have plenty of that.

However, we were excited to go back during Restaurant Week, and we were unfortunately, very disappointed. While I know restaurants usually skimp on portion sizes during Restaurant Week, the portions we experienced on Monday evening were outrageously small. In fact, we ended up going to another nearby restaurant AFTER dinner for appetizers because we were still so hungry - we should not have had to go to another restaurant after spending nearly $100 on dinner. 

Overall, the food was very good, just small. For starters we had the shrimp appetizer,  it came with four average size pieces of shrimp, very good, followed by the filet and short rib duo entree...we each got literally two thin slices of filet and a TINY piece of short rib. We got one of each of the desserts which were very good, but again, very small.

I understand restaurants don't love Restaurant Week, but why participate then?? I am left with a very poor taste in my mouth about R2L (which I have previously loved) because I truly felt like we got ripped off at dinner. My only other gripe is, it was clear they were trying to turn tables over quickly. The bread basket and our appetizers were brought out at the same time, within 5 minutes of us ordering. Our appetizer plates weren't even cleared when by the time our dinner appeared.

We bought the living social from a few weeks back ($15 for $30 to spend) and tonight we finally cashed it in.  We decided pretty last minuted to go out to dinner and called them a little after 7pm (on a Friday!).  They sounded crazy busy on the phone but said we could come at 8:30.  We showed up a few minutes before and the place was pretty full (and they were setting up for a large group which took up 3-4 tables).  We had to wait about 15min for some tables to clear out and we ended up at the sushi bar.  

The menu is pretty huge and they have sushi and non sushi options (bi bim bap,udon, terriyaki etc).  We went for sushi so that's what we spent the most time pondering.  The place was super busy and it took them a little bit to take our order, but one of the sushi makers was super on top of things and had someone come over as soon as he noticed we were no longer absorbed in the menu choices.  We started with the veggie tempura which was well done and the dipping sauce was really tasty (more like a broth than a sauce).  There was carrot, sweet potato, asparagus, onion, broccoli, and cucumber.  Yum!  

For the sushi we got: Raw Viking Roll, The Stallion Roll, Sweet Potato Tempura Roll (I loveee sweet potatoes), and a normal yellowtail roll.  I have to say they were all well done.  I hadn't had torched sushi before so the Stallion was my first time, I was a little wary since I generally prefer raw fish to cooked fish but it was soooo good!  

So after this great experience, we decided to keep it going and ordered the tempura vanilla ice cream.  It was HUGE.  At $8 I was a little wary of ordering it since I figured it would be small, but goodness did they give us a ton.  It was gorgeously presented with fresh cut strawberries, and giant mounds of both tempura ice cream and whipped cream.  I can't believe we finished it, but I'll admit that we did.  I wish we had taken pictures of everything, but we both left our phones behind so that we wouldn't get distracted (ok really I just forgot my damn phone!).  

After all of this the bill was only $60 ($55 pre tax).  After the living social was applied it was only $30, yayyyyyy.  Had it been a little less busy it would have been perfect.  We found out at the end that they were down a server for the evening which had a lot to do with the chaotic nature of the place that night.

From the second you walk in the door, you are greeted by the freshest, most organic produce anywhere.  Essene has that independent business atmosphere, unlike that of Whole Foods (which just reeks of corporate and contrived for me).  The selections get better as you go along - a wide variety of organic flours are available to buy (by the pound), the same with a few types of beans and peas, a great selection of soymilks, chips, and even organic pet food awaits your inspection.

I understand organic products are not subsidized by the federal government the way corporate ""food"" is, but five bucks for a piece of hazlenut cake???

It's a shame the prices are so high, but until there are more subsidies for real (organic) food, prices will, unfortunately, remain high.

Now, I'm no expert on Southern food, far from it.  But to my credit, I have enjoyed Southern cuisine in New Orleans, so I think that buys me just a little bit of respect.  

That said, I found Beck's surprisingly good.

The wait staff was incredibly friendly, offering samples of just about anything we wanted and patiently waiting for us to decide on what we'd like.  We ended up going for the gator gumbo and shrimp crawfish pasta--both excellent!  Gator gumbo was rich, flavorful, and had a good amount of meat and rice.  Shrimp crawfish pasta was simple with a tasty sauce.

The only knock is that it's a little pricey given the quantities.  But if you live around Philly and you're craving some good Southern food, this is a solid choice.",2010-12-03 16:48:33,"{'food': ['gator gumbo', 'shrimp crawfish pasta'], 'drink': []}"

We came here with our two young daughters and the staff was very sweet to them.  They made us feel special, which is what I expect at a 4 star hotel.  

The hotel was a savings and loan corporation at one time, in fact, a safe door is still visible in the main lobby.  The main lobby itself is nice and modern, however, sparse.  The upper floors have a modern if not slightly outdated feel but are clean crisp looking.  We stayed on the 31st floor which had a large sitting lounge with flat screen TV where a continental breakfast was served complete with muffins, bagels, jam, cream cheese, smoked salmon, coffee, and juice.  The room had a wonderful view of the skyline, was spacious, had an old HDTV, and a nice sized bathroom.  The beds were very comfortable and I slept very well both nights we were there.  

As a side, we decided that our 2 yr old daughter wasn't going to sleep well with us in bed because she's a light sleeper so we asked the staff for a roll-away bed.  They got one to our room right away and told us that it would be $25/night.  We were fine with that, however, upon checkout, we saw that they had waved the roll-away bed charge.  Very nice.

If you're going to do 'touristy' stuff, this hotel's location is perfect.  Walk 6 block east and you're in the historic district.  Walk 2 blocks north and you're at the Reading Terminal Market (reviewed).

It was 10 PM and the hostess had said sitting outside was fine -  I told the server that we had discussed it with the hostess, at which point the server rolled her eyes and said she would have to go check with the hostess.  After five awkward minutes of feeling like scolded children, the server came back and said that she would let us sit there (was she doing us a favor?) but if someone wanted the table to eat, then she would move us.  I said, ""Even though two of the four of us are eating?"" and she said, very condescendingly, ""Sweetheart, you're just eating SALADS.""  I was completely offended and flabbergasted - it was a really hostile tone from our server for no apparent reason - there were no parties waiting for tables, it was 10 PM, and we actually HAD ordered food.  We joked that we should have engaged in a philosophical argument about what dinner constituted.

Needless to say that we were feeling pretty uncomfortable and so we left.  When we went to let the server know as a courtesy so she wouldn't fill our order, she basically begged us to stay, compounding the awkwardness.

Pub & Kitchen is in my neighborhood and it has been one of my favorite spots because of the delicious food and beer.

I wanted to try as many dishes as possible so I opted out of the entree and instead ordered several appetizers. For our main dishes we ordered the calamari, saganaki and bureki and the lamb kofta entree. 

The Calamari was served with a side of Armenian tomato dip. It was perfectly cooked and tasted light, crispy and tender.Next up was the Saganaki- a favorite of mine. The pan friend halloumi cheese was served in ouzo and lemon sauce with a delicious caramelized fig and side salad. This was one of the best I've had...including those which were devoured on many restaurants in Athens, Mykonos and Paros.  The Bureki was served next: a fillo pastry parcel stuffed with feta and thyme drizzled with honey served with a side of roasted beats. The presentation was so beautiful with a taste to match. Crispy layers of fillo oozing with feta cheese. The Count found that the honey made it more appropriate for dessert but I loved it, especially the presentation.

The lamb kofta was served next. It was a skewer of ground lamb kofta mixed with apricot and pistachios served with a  side of pomegranate salad, lentils and Greek yogurt. The lamb was excellent filled with magic flavors. But what truly made it special were the side dishes. The pomegranate salad was so original. I've never had pomegranate served as a salad as in Iran it tends to be eaten as a fruit or juiced. The mixture of pomegranate with onions and spices was excellent. Then there was the lentil salad which was again a first for me. I mixed spoonfuls of the kabob, pomegranate and lentil salad together and found the combination to be intoxicating. The quality of the ingredients are present in each spoonful. You can tell that the chef really prides himself on his food. 

For dessert we ordered the pistachio and olive oil cake and warm chocolate mousse. Both desserts were out of this world. I really loved the pistachio cake it was light yet intense in flavors served with a side of pistachio ice cream and cherries.  The Chocolate mousse was baked to perfection oozing with warm gooey chocolate served with a scoop of ice cream. Wow. Is all I can say about this restaurant.

They were pretty busy when we walked in on a Thursday night, but we were able to get a window seat right away. It was a little chilly sitting next to the window, even though it was closed, but the hot tea warmed us up. 

We started with the roti, which I could not stop eating. It was so good! Next we had the mango chicken and the pad thai. The mango chicken in particular was delicious. I would definitely order it again, along with the roti. The chicken was tender and all white-meat, and sauce had a nice kick. 

We were laughing about all the notes on the menu next to a bunch of items requesting that you ask your server about the dish before ordering it. It did make us avoid those dishes though. If we go back to Penang, which we definitely would if we lived in Philly, we might want to order one of the dishes with the warning, if nothing else, out of curiosity. 

A few nights later we tried Banana Leaf, and although we enjoyed our meal there, too, we liked the food and atmosphere a little better at Penang. I'm getting hungry just thinking about our meal there. *drool*

I thought I'd give it a try since there are so many positive reviews! It's a BYOB, which is always a great reason to try a new restaurant. It's a small restaurant, maybe enough for 40 people to dine, and the ambiance is nice. 

The waiter, Ian, was attentive and knowledgeable. He was also training another waiter named David who was helpful as well. When Ian saw that my husband had brought a beer and I didn't bring an alcoholic beverage, he told me about the other beverages they have. I got the unfiltered ginger ale, and it was delicious! It was a bottled soda, but I don't remember the brand.

They brought out a bread basket with two different kinds of bread, both tasty. For appetizers, I got the duck confit and my husband got the shrimp and crab chopped salad. Both were huge portions that could probably be ordered as a main dish. The ham jam on my plate was to die for, and the duck was a bit dry. It also came with a parsnip puree, but only a smearing on the plate. I could have done with more. My husband's salad was tasty, but I couldn't taste the shrimp or crab because of the blue cheese in the salad. 

On to entrees. I had the root vegetable strudel and my husband had the steak. We also ordered the fennel fingerlings as a side. When they brought the fingerlings out, they apologized that there was no fennel in them, and told us we didn't have to pay for them. Sweet! They were tasty anyway. My entree was good! Flaky pastry, yummy sweet potato mash, and a nice mushroom gravy. The gravy was described as truffle gravy on the menu, but I didn't taste any truffle. My husband's steak was done to his liking, and he really liked the potato/parsnip mash that came with it, as well as the pan sauce on the plate.

Overall, a great meal! I am excited to come back and try their spring menu!",2015-03-23 19:41:06,"{'food': ['duck confit', 'shrimp and crab chopped salad', 'root vegetable strudel', 'fennel fingerlings'], 'drink': ['unfiltered ginger ale']}"

The fajita wrap is super flavorful, and the veggie burger, though not as inexplicably identical to its carnivorous counterpart as the crispy chick'n, is meaty and hearty.  Sweet potato fries are good - pretty standard - but what makes them unique is the dipping sauce, a whipped concoction of savory cilantro goodness.  The only downsides I can see are that they've been sold out of the kale the two times we've tried to order it, and there's no restroom for their dine-in customers.
