I made a reservation here for my birthday. My friends and I arrived there and were kept standing by the door for a half hour. The place seemed full and there was no place for us to be seated. Not sure what the point of making the reservation was...aren't they supposed to hold a table for us??? After repeated requests to seat us we were taken to a dimly lit backroom by a service restroom. 

Service was slow and the waiter took his time to come and take our orders. We had to ask several times for a performance by the belly dancer before she came and did a cursory performance. The worst part of everything was the food which ranged from completely bland to inedible.I just could not understand the combination of a sweet pie with almonds and chicken with powdered sugar and then lamb with honey on top. Even thinking about the food from last night makes me want to throw up. ""Desert"" was bananas, apples and oranges in a basket with a knife to cut it ourselves!!!! After sitting through the worst possible service and food, we were stuck with a bill of $520 for 8 people which included an $80 tip!! I would recommend everyone to stay as far away as possible from this place.",2011-01-16 17:46:31,"{'food': ['pie with almonds', 'chicken with powdered sugar', 'lamb with honey on top'], 'drink': []}"

It's true, what can I say, 8 am buzzsaws make me very cantankerous.  I was even more concerned when I read about their plans to put tables around the fountain in the intersection in the warm weather months, as P'unk ave drinkers sometimes tend to forget that people do, in fact, live here and can be a little over boisterous at 2am.  In light of all that, I agreed to try the place out very reluctantly.  I'm really glad I did.

My boyfriend, one of my friends and I decided to give Izumi a whirl on a warm Friday night about a month ago or so.  They had not yet gotten clearance from the neighborhood association to expand their outside seating to the fountain and the place was packed.  The server who met us at the door cheerfully informed us that there would be an hour wait for seating and that they are a BYOB, but that Paradiso has take out if we wanted to grab a six pack to bring back with us.  She also listed all of the bars along the Ave that would be good places to hang out while we waited and offered to call our cell phones when our table was ready.  Needless to say, Izumi had me at ""Hello"".   Where else can you get such VIP service without actually having to throw money around like you're a high roller?

We returned home to have a beer and wait for the call, which came pretty quickly with an offer to sit at the counter if we wanted, or to wait the full hour for a table.  We elected to sit at the counter and within mere minutes, we were happily seated with full wine glasses and were enjoying the show of sushi chefs adeptly carving through jewel like pieces of fish.  

Now, I have to admit here that I am not the most adventurous  of sushi eaters and I typically stick to California rolls and veggie rolls.  However, the boyfriend was very excited that they had sea urchin on the menu and he went to town ordering a ton of ala cart sashimi and a few pieces of sushi.  I stuck to my old standby of California roll and tried Izumi's Passyunk Ave Roll, which is shrimp tempura with some kind of spicy crab salad.  What truly impressed me was this, the California roll was less expensive than any of the take out and fast service sushi places throughout the city and it contained REAL CRAB.  With a C, and not a K!   An hour later we were all happily stuffed to the gills and ready for a nap.  I will return to Izumi for sure.  And, now that they do have those fountain side tables set up, I have been happily reassured that they are not creating a neighborhood nuisance, but a charmingly local place that seems to bring a lot of relaxed smiles to the Ave!",2009-05-26 14:29:26,"{'food': ['sushi', 'California roll', 'shrimp tempura', 'spicy crab salad'], 'drink': []}"

The atmosphere is really chill and relaxing. Makes me want to escape Philly and go to the islands! I wish they imported some sand to cover up all the rocks lol. The grassy area is nice.

As much as I love the atmosphere, the food was OK.  Was good, but not raving good.  I'm surprised Guy Fieri came here for DDD, I didn't think the food was good enough for that.  The collard greens were really salty.  The roti was good, kind of dry.  My friend had the jerk chicken, the rice and veggies were good, he really enjoyed the chicken, although it was a bit dry without the sauce (he got jerk sauce on the side because its very very spicy).  I love plantains, and they were just OK here.  Nothing special.

People complain a lot about the service here.  We actually had a really good waitress, she was totally chill, super nice, and helped me out a lot with the menu.  She came back several times to check on us.  Only slow part was getting our bill paid, but that's because the place was full by then and she had a dozen tables.

I see some people complaining about beer snobbery, but I've never encountered it in my experiences there. Maybe it's because I usually buy my cheap stuff from a distributor and go to here for the more exotic, nerd approved beers... still, I've never gotten any flak for picking up my occasional ""I'm broke and need something cheap and efficient"" six pack.

I recommend checking out the back area and the counter first, as they'll have some unique seasonals on display. You'll almost always get to the counter and see something that makes you think, ""Aw man, I should have gotten that.""

I deduct a star simply because it's not particularly friendly to the income-impaired. If Foodery is a casino, the clerk is the croupier, and pricing your selection is like spinning the roulette wheel.

Sidebar: I'm not sure if this is a regular occurrence - I really hope it is - but, the servers/bartenders had some sort of food/beer challenge going on. . Basically, two staffers make up a beer or food combo and the selections are pitted against each other on the special board. It seems the only rule is that the first person to sell out their item wins. So, if you go and, all of a sudden, ""final countdown"" is, out of nowhere, blaring over the speakers and someone is dancing around with an empty keg over their head like it's the Stanley Cup, you'll know what's going on.

It's rare to attend one of the most well-acclaimed restaurant in Philly, but when you snag that available spot on opentable, then get ready for a culinary experience that will loosen your belt and rock your socks off. Unfortunately, this review is many months post the Vetri experience, so much of my memories are piecemealed together through my photos. However, while Vetri Cucina is a tasting menu extravaganza, you should definitely consider a daytime fast for the epic amount of food that you'll be encouraged to consume in a 2-hour feasting session. Oh, did I mention the 6-dessert finisher? Just saying.

Everything at Vetri Cucina was thrilling, from the hand made pasta, to the expertly stuffed lamb sausage to the roasted duck breast. Even the olives were to dine for. 

I will say that the service felt a bit...off, only because we were served by an inconsistent number of people and the wine pairing came at odd intervals and the unclear explanations of each dish made the experience falter, but I think it was excusable overall.

See, I always feel like a moose woman in a china shop anyway, or I'm carrying a huge bag that I'm trying not to hit into people with, or I just generally have some other ridiculous issue where a tiny shop can gimme a panic. So, the point is: ahhhh spread out a little. It's the same delicious vegan fast food stylins and salads from your original HipCityVeg; now with more leg room. 

Also, here's another thing, a sidenote to all this limited seating talk. I love the hell outta that udon salad, but I'm one of these people who seem to take forever to eat a damn salad. I have felt much anxiety, self-consciously imagining that those waiting to score my seat are hissing at me in their minds, ""Jeeeeezus, just will this one just take it to go already."" Neuroses. So you understand what I'm saying. You can at salads at your leisure, or enjoy sweet potato fries and crispy, crispy nuggets at their peak crispiness. Or both. Makes such a difference, I tell you: a lil extra space and maximum crispiness.

Speaking of making a difference- when they take the time to griddle a little char onto that seitan in the udon salad, I love that. It really gives the protein that grilly somethin somethin. I love it that this arrugula-y salad it's an actual greens-packed salad with noodles in it, rather than, you know, a bigg asss noodle bowl with some greens fluttered lightly in. Listen, I'm all for extra noodle, but, ya know, sometimes your trying to do a thing. Anyway, I enjoy this dish, I do, even if it could use a little less dressing at times. I'm not complaining bout that though, really. So tasty.

In closing, I'd like to repeat the announcement that the Crispy HipCity Ranch remains my favorite, favorite. It cures a chicken sandwich yen for me, maybe better than a real bird sandwich, even. I have real HipCityVeg hankerings and I find myself coming up with more reasons to head West to University City. Maybe I should go back and get that masters.

When I walked in, the ambience was pretty much what'd you expect for a Saturday night, with groups of friends sitting at tables and parties of 1-2 sitting at the bar. The wait was initially quoted as an hour, but someone finished up early and I only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. 

They had an interesting selection of beers and cocktails, but I wasn't thirsty so much as hungry so I passed on the drinks. The menu was very simple and straightforward, and I ordered the crab broth noodles and dumplings in chili oil. 

The dumplings in chili oil came first, there were 4 cute dumplings in a small bowl. They were very tasty, but were different than what I was expecting. Growing up in Asia, dumplings usually have higher fat content and are easier to chew, but I guess the meat in these dumplings were leaner and took a bit longer to chew through.

The crab broth noodles came shortly after, and I must say I was pretty disappointed. I passed over the miso ramen for these noodles, and the soup in this broth was a bit spicy and sour, but wasn't as brothy as they claimed. The hand-drawn noodles were quite tasty and bouncy, but to me they were ruined by the broth.

Both of these I have put up in the picture section.  They are both beautifully presented and tasted just as excellent.  Sometimes the most simple ingredients make for the best meals.  

BYOB bomb boyeee!

I forgot to mention the delicious french-pressed coffee!  It was sooo good.  A friend of ours makes this kind of coffee often, so he was very good and taking it nice and slow to press down.

I was so thankful for that recommendation!  I spent many evenings at Tria and enjoyed almost all of their red wines.  The ambiance is great and the customer service is top notch.  

The majority of the time I sat at the bar and had a glass of wine while enjoying one of their delicious bruschettas or a sandwich.  My two favorite bruschettas were the goat cheese and pesto or the pistacho herbed ricotta with lavender honey.  Both are absolutely amazing!

Hannah was one of the bartenders that always took good care of me.  She would make various recommendations based upon my preferences and she was always spot on with her selections.

It can get a bit noisy at times, but that's par for the course when you have such a small restaurant.

Sadly I'm back home and can't spend anymore evenings at this wine bar.  I can say for certain that if I'm in Philadelphia anytime soon that this will be the first place I go to for dinner and wine.

I rarely give 5 star reviews, but this place deserves it.  Every time I went there (and there were many), I never once received bad service, bad food, or bad wine.

The ratio of margarita mix to tequila was very inconsistent, with a taste equivalent to overly sweetened lemonade with barely any alcohol. When we kindly requested the bartender add an additional shot (we even stated we were willing to pay extra if we had to), he gave us a sour attitude about it and proceeded to talk about us to his coworker.

The wife, baby and I began heading with hopes of hitting up Dock Street. Well, Dock Street is not open on Sundays.

At that point we were committed to Baltimore Avenue, but both wanted something new. That cancelled out the usual good spots, The Gold Standard, Vientiane Café, and Vietnam Cafe. And, yes, those are two different places spelled almost the same, one Thai, the other Vietnamese.

So, this brought us to Queen Of Sheba. We had talked many times about trying out some Ethiopian food, especially since there are several in the area.

Sheba was more bar than restaurant. It was very empty, so we had the run of the place. There menu was very small. I was disappointed they did not have any meat combinations.

We initially were going to get the chicken and lamb tidbits, as well as an app called Foul. The waitress was kind enough to tell us that was A LOT of food. She informed us each meat dish comes with a mess of veggies.

So, we decided on just the chicken. Moments later we were told they were out of the chicken. Who runs out of chicken? It's not like there was a rush of people that came in before us. It was 1pm on a Sunday. We almost left, but got over it and ordered the lamb.

When the food arrived, we were very pleased. It all tasted very good. The lamb was tender and there was hardly any fat. The bread was done just right, just the right amount of sponginess. The veggies were done just right as well. We also really enjoyed the Foul, which is not to be confused with Fowl. It's actually vegetarian and I believe bean based.

I love meat, all kinds of meat, so I didn't think I'd be satisfied with an all veggie sandwich. Govinda's is good, but after eating their chicken cheesesteaks again and again, you'll realize that you're just eating bread (seitan) with bread (the bun or wrap) with a small helping of peppers.

The Crispy HipCity Ranch is also delish. The Bella Bistro is a big portabella mushroom sandwich. Many vegetarians will claim that portabella mushrooms taste almost exactly like beef. It doesn't. It's good, but to call it beef would be insulting to both beef and mushrooms. The Bella Bistro is a nice, hearty sandwich filled with plenty of red onions and artichokes, a couple of slices of tomato (from possibly a small beefsteak tomato), arugala, and olive tampenade all in a big multi-grain roll. Be forewarned, your breath will stink of onions when you're done, but it's sooo good. The Fajita Wrap with its blackened soy chicken, peppers, onions, pico de gallo, and avocado is a little more forgiving.

My veal parmigiana was excellent as were the other orders that included veal, pasta/meatballs, and eggplant.  

The service was average but it ranked along side of the prices.  You are not paying top prices (city) so expect college and/or high school kids to wait on you.  Again, this is all fine but just know that this is more like a cafeteria and not like an upper class Italian restaurant.  

The important feedback that I have is that this place is extremely loud!  I just say this so that you are prepared when choosing this place for a given night/occasion.  I expect that when you read this you will wonder how loud, loud can be.  You will come back to my point... hahaha.

The parking was a bit of a challenge even though I was expecting there to be valet parking.  There was 1 person and on a busy Saturday, I never did see him. I had to run around the block a few times before I went out on my own to find a spot.  This is not a problem but just know that parking might be challenging as would be expected for the city.

The highlights were the dan dan noodles and kung pao chicken. Perfect amount of spiciness and great flavor. A new level of chinese food quality (as expected for the high price!). 

The mapo tofu was good. The tofu is very soft and delicate, which I enjoy (as an Asian diner perhaps), but my friend did not care for this consistency. A bit greasy and a little too spicy though... it is definitely a ""we're obsessed with the 1-10 spiciness scale because it is so trendy, so we're going to tarnish a typical, traditional dish."" I think the 1-10 rating is a new, convenient option, but I hope that Han Dynasty will also respect the tradition of the dishes they are serving... even if the diner doesn't necessarily know what they are supposed to taste like in the first place. 

The double-cooked flounder was OK. Kind of salty, which was disappointing for a $20 plate. Perhaps that is the flavor meant by ""double-cooked."" Maybe it was the added spices.

I finally gave in on Saturday and tried a Qdoba burrito for the first time.  Here are my thoughts:

Looks like Chipotle, smells like Chipotle, tastes pretty much like Chipotle.  They start out with the same tortilla press, and move on to the rice (same as Chipotle with the green spices mixed in), and then the beans.  Qdoba has an offer of refried beans as well, which I don't think Chipotle has.  Same salsa options, sour cream, cheese, etc.  I ordered the ""Queso Burrito"" which has something that Chipotle doesn't: delicious, melted queso.  It really made the difference and was so darn good.  If you're not a cheese fiend, I would say it doesn't matter which place you choose, but it certainly was yummy.  

Disclaimer:  if you have anything to do for the next 3 hours after your lunch, do NOT choose Qdoba (or for that matter, Chipotle).

The service was excellent, particularly the wine service. 

The food, on the other hand, was uneven. The scallop and the gnocchi dishes were incredible, but the other dishes - wild boar pasta, roast, some awful bone marrow dish my friend received, and the desserts were not good enough to warrant the price tag. Moreover, I felt like each dish was heavier than the next. I wish the menu was better balanced with a few more dishes that had a lighter touch. After the scallops, it was all meat, pasta and heavy sauces. 

Finally, I was with two friends and I hated that we each received something different at each course and we had no input on who received what. I understand respectingt eh vision of the chef, but what about serving the tastes of the customers?  

I go to a lot of high end restaurants and a lot of multi course dinners. I'm not uncomfortable spending well over $150 for a meal, BUT, I also expect a meal in this price range to be amazing and I was far from amazed at Vetri.

Complimentary garlic knots with olive oil and garlic are provided.  The first time I was here, the garlic knots were room temperature but the second time, they were served warm.  Who can say no to warm garlic knots?  This place is BYOB, which is great... but be warned that there's a corkage fee that no one told us about.  To be fair, we didn't ask but it was surprising to see it just show up on the bill.  We shared the mussels appetizer.  I was a little suspicious of getting the mussels at first, b/c the menu advertises that the dish consists of one dozen mussels, which is nothing.  However, we'd seen a plate of mussels sail by us and it certainly seemed like more than a dozen.  The waitress told us that if the mussels are more plentiful, that more than a dozen will be served so we ordered the mussels too and true to form, there were certainly more than a dozen.  They were cooked in a marinara sauce.

I got the Cavatelli, which was a generous portion.  The previous time, I'd tried the salmon, which came with really good truffled mashed potatoes.  The salmon had been a smidge on the dry side but I had no complaints about the Cavatelli and I had leftovers for the next day too.

One of the drawbacks is that there's a two-card maximum here.

Now that all that negativity is out of the way...the interior here is great, very inviting.  I always compare it to a hipped-up Brady Bunch home.  A fireplace, carpeting...nightlights at the tables with vintage travel scenes.  The menu fits perfectly with the homey interior - homespun classics such as meatloaf & pot roast sit next to more inventive pasta and seafood dishes.  Definitely something to eat here for everyone.  They have great drinks & good service as well.

I probably ate here for brunch more than I did for dinner - again, get here early or be prepared to wait.  The monkey bread to start...amazing.  Make sure you have 3-4 people to help you eat this or you'll either a) not finish it or b) not have enough room for brunch.  Classic brunch fare but done very very well.

I went upstairs to the bar and ordered off of their specialty cocktail menu.  The bartender was quick, skilled and friendly.  The mint julep he made me was probably the best version of that drink I've ever had!  My date had some sort of fruity black cherry drink in an up glass that was similarly excellent.

Best of all was the live blues band rocking out on stage.  I was floored when I found out that the band was really an open mic jam session that they host on Sundays.  We were treated to some very good musicians who just showed up to play.  It made for a great atmosphere that I'll likely go back to experience again.

The chicken and waffles were quite tasty, but sliders they were not. (But cut that waffle piece in half, use it to sandwich the chicken and it's close enough). We were not offered much syrup with them, and ended up requesting more on the side, so I don't think we really got to perceive the sriracha component that was supposed to be present. 

Cowboy burger was freshly made and the meat juicy, but the bottled overly sweet BBQ sauce ruined it a bit. The turkey burger was similarly fresh but suffered from a conflict in flavors: roasted garlic hummus is tasty,  but it (and possibly the spices in the patty itself) competed with a cranberry chutney I was hoping to taste. Fries needed salt, the sauteed spinach was far too oily to eat. Those who ordered enchiladas were happy enough. The place's eponymous grilled cheese lacked cheese... so that was a bit of a let-down.

It's not terrible, but it's got some kinks it needs to work out, and by work out I mean the whole layout needs to be demolished and then redesigned to accommodate the large crowds.  

I don't think they took into account that DOUBLE the amount of people will be crammed into this space, regardless of square footage.  Not only do you have the old Snyder Shoprite folks now begrudgingly making their way over to the new location, you still have the former Oregon Pathmark people who are like, ""hey, this is our turf.""  It's literally the only one-stop shop, unless you wanna go to Walmart or Target for terrible meat/produce selections and let's face it, no one wants to go there unless absolutely necessary.  Shoprite's selections and deals are the shiiitttt.

So anyway, the PROS:
-Larger space for DAT ENTRANCE DOE with all the fun, extra shit we never had (or probably needed) before, like a HOT CHINESE FOOD buffet! Sushi area! Amazing cheese variety! WAY more fresh donuts, pastries, cakes, breads, etc.! And a sweet bonus, tucked-away-in-a-corner pricy organic section where you can get $8 brown sugar!
-TONS more of the ""15 items or less"" registers with kitschy signs named after Philly streets.  
(PRO TIP: you can also check out at customer service during high volume - which it always is).
-Toiletries/bathroom stuff section is in the dead center of the aisles, lower shelves and very well lit - seems much better than the last place and has a great selection.
-Parking lot is larger, I think.  I haven't encountered many problems with this.
-The inner aisles seem spacier and more breathable and everything seems to have a better selection/variety in general.  (As for the outskirts of the store, stay tuned below).
-They finally adopted the giant family boxes of cereal like Target - buy in bulk, people!

The CONS:
-Carts allllll the way on the left when the entrance is allllll the way on the right. 
-Produce area is just...weird.  Like I gotta dig inside deep  shelving to get to the good onions instead of them being out in the open (I guess so people's grubby fingers don't touch everything at once).
-Every goddamn thing I need (besides the meat, luckily) is in coolers with doors in the wall now, as opposed to the old grab and go, loosey-goosey feel.  So if 10 people need milk/OJ/eggs/juice/yogurt in the same area you're in, you best be sure you've gotta politely wait for 10 people to browse, select and leave.  Legit, the giant area from where the coolers start to where they end is just a sea of people and carts you've gotta meander through.  Honestly, forego the cart and do small basket grocery runs to save yourself the hassle, if you can.
-The dreaded CROWDS: the fish/meat/coolers sections are terrible, but even worse is the checkout lines.  Somehow, the old place managed to get a handle on this.  I think this space is narrower here.  Try to get to the speedy checkout if you only have a little bit, but otherwise, have fun finding where one line ends and the other begins with all the damn CARTS.

There was a hazelnut bread as well but honestly, I could have just had the snails as is. My boyfriend got the sashimi which we could have done without. It was fine but not too memorable. For the second course, I got the carrot rigatoni which was another extremely delightful dish - I loved the crispy rabbit on top. He got the wild mushroom ""risotto"" which actually lacked some sort of texture and wasn't as good as the rigatoni. Then we moved ontot he dry aged beef. While it was very tender and delicious, cooked to perfection, it didn't seem like it was dry aged for very long and could have been a bit more flavorful. I would certainly order it again.

I walked to the Comcast Center with a friend and chose a slice of La Scala's Pizza of the Day which was pepperoni and sausage, and also asked for a plain slice. To top it off I ordered a root beer soda. My total was close to $9. I haven't had any of their entree's but they all looked delicious, sitting pretty behind the display glass. My name was called a few minutes after I ordered and I loaded up my pizza slices with crushed red pepper and garlic from the tray located a few feet in front of the setup.

The pizza was a little too greasy, but nothing a few napkins couldn't take care of. Each bite was delicious and the crust was fantastic. If I win the lottery or am lucky enough to get an annual raise this year, I'll be sure to make La Scala's a favorite eatery.

The ordering kiosks were easy-to-use and it was fun to customize my bun or pho.

I recommend their bun and pho. I liked being able to carefully choose the meats and toppings I wanted through the ordering kiosk. The bun was big and it was delicious with their house-made nuoc mam pha. The pho had a tasty broth that didn't need any additional seasonings. Lots of good pieces of tripe, beef meatballs, tendon, and flank steak. I did not try their com tam, but my SO did have the pork chop com tam. It looked quite tasty with generous portions of bi (shredded pork skin) and cha (egg meat quiche). I also tried their banh mi but something was off.

The duck is always soft and perfectly shredded even though it doesn't have a lot of flavor or any sauce on it, but that's what brings out the true flavor of the duck!

I'm a vegetarian so finding a place that served delicious, fresh sandwiches (on slices of bread, not rolls) and mouth-watering breakfasts was always tricky, but this place sure delivers. They are one of the few places, in my opinion, that concentrates more on their food rather than their income. Everything I've had on the menu was wonderful and their specials are always innovative and delicious. I would consider myself quite the ""foodie"" and this place gets high marks in my book. There is definitely a reason why Ants Pants has been recognized in so many magazines articles (check the window from outside).

As for the common complaints I've read, there are ""floaties"" in the water because when we fill the pitchers we add slices of either lemon or cucumber (hence the flavoring). Little bits of the flavorings in water will fall off when they're carried around so much. As for the customers, the regulars are some of the nicest people ever. I still see them on the street and they always make a point to stop and say ""hi"" (even though I haven't worked there for some months now). Unfortunately, like every restaurant, we do get a handful of annoying, mean customers (usually out-of-towners). Sorry if they ruin your meal, they ruin our day too.
I guess most people don't notice when they walk in, but the place doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles. Every piece of food put into your mouth or every drink you down was made completely from scratch by one or two people. They don't have a full kitchen, so time is sacrificed for freshness. If your meal takes long, it's because only two people are putting it together from scratch. They don't open a bag of pre-made food and pop it in the microwave like other restaurants. The same goes for the servers. There are only two people waiting tables on the weekend and it is EXTREMELY had to keep on top of everything. Next time take a look at everyone working on the weekend. I think it would be hard to point out someone who is just standing around and not preforming a task. If you want attentive and quick service, definitely show up M-T at any time or before 10am on the weekends.

We also ordered the broiled seafood platter where you got the smallest sea scallops, a soggy piece of farm raised tilapia, 6 jumbo shrimp, a half pound of snow crabs and a silver dollar sized crab cake. The crab cake was the standout on the dish. I opted to take the fish home and finish cooking it. 

We also ordered cocktails. They were just okay. The ambiance was dated and could use new or cleaned carpets. We tried it. Likely will not be back.

The gnocchi are always good, but definitely ask for bolognese sauce; otherwise they are served with a mediocre tomato gravy.  The tortellini and peas is always reliable; the Alfredo sauce is excellent. Re apps, skip the calamari--just not good anymore.  Eggplant involtini, roman artichokes, bruschetta---all excellent. Usually the fish specials are very, very good. Service can be spotty, but ask for Trish if things aren't going well--and then they will be going very well.  Limoncello is a fabulous dessert, and usually there is a fresh made cake or pie to die for; cappuccino is excellent.  The carry out is great --for pizza.

Casey, helped me create a custom martini as the drink special for my party,he concocted a delectable coconut, cherry, lime martini and my guest simply loved them, let me tell you Leah-tini's are delicious! Ask for one.

The food was simply incredible! My guest feasted on three courses of hot appetizers, we had jumbo garlic fried shrimp (to die for!), calamari with jalepenos (crisp, crunchy, full of flavor), steak spring rolls (beefy, cheesy, yummy), cheese fries and Dave was nice enough to add spicy buffalo wings to my party food menu for the night. Some of my guest ordered other items as well, the crab cakes got rave reviews!

The DJ kept us dancing all night with a combination of dance music, pop music and selections from a playlist I gave to Dave, I danced almost the entire night!

The bar staff never had anyone wait longer than a few seconds to place thier drink order.

As I found easy parking on both sides of the streets, the outside of the building looks great with fresh flower boxes aligning the windows and clean and upbeat facade.
I walk in the rustic big wooden door and was greeted immediately by 2 friendly staff members. The place is a converted warehouse and they did a great job combing the urban loft feel with natural materials like wood and stone. Great feel to the place.
I found out the food is form the 2014 Vendy award winner Oink and Moo that has a few trucks and location in Jersey. The owner was there and was very helpful in answering some questions. The place was packed and he still took the time to talk to me and some locals who were inquiring about jobs.
Now onto the best part. The food and drink. They have over 200 kinds of bottled beer from around the world and some great labels like Fresh Squeezed, Dogfish, Oscar Blues and more. They have 6 rotating craft beers that change on a weekly basis. I had 3 of their drafts (Victory Summer, Allagash White, and Yards IPA) and took a 6 pack home. 
The food was also amazing. My girlfriend and I tried 6 different things (don't judge). We had the brisket sliders - moist, smokey and very tender and flavorful, the pulled pork tacos - tangy, meaty, deliciousness, the ribs - literally I ate these with a fork right off the bone as the tender, juicy, meat just fell off at first fork hit. Then we had 3 of their sides; Mac and cheese - best mac and cheese at a barbecue spot ever, lots of cheesy flavor, the elbow macaroni was cooked al dente, and we actually ordered a 2nd one. Then we had the cornbread which was tasty and moist like it should be and lastly an really good vinegar based potato salad.
The place was packed, the service friendly, the food was best barbecue in the city, and the beer list was impressive and all at an affordable price. The city needed this barbecue and craft beer spot as I will most definitely be back next week with some of my buddies.",2015-06-12 17:26:36,"{'food': ['brisket sliders', 'pulled pork tacos', 'ribs'], 'drink': ['Victory Summer', 'Allagash White', 'Yards IPA', 'Fresh Squeezed', 'Dogfish', 'Oscar Blues']}"

When it comes to quality, Swiss Haus is not to be beat.  This place has been a neighborhood fixture for over 70 years and you have to be something to survive in a place as tough as Rittenhouse Square.  I have had their cupcakes, gluten-free brownies, and their chocolate chip pound cake - which is, hands down, THE best I have ever tasted!

Their coffee, which is the ubiquitous and rather run-of-the-mill La Colombe, is fantastic (which is solely due to the way they brew it).  They let you fix your brew yourself, which gives them extra points here.

The only reason I'm knocking off a star is because I don't think the staff engages their customers enough.  Now, I know first-hand that working at a bakery is extremely high-pressured, even if you're just working the counter.  It IS retail after all, and when you're dealing with the public ...

But I feel a distance from the staff that should not exist.  I have been there several times and they don't have that umph that other people here have pointed out.

Be that as it may, I try to look past that, but can't help feeling a bit alienated by that distant attitude.  

And another slight complaint is the prices are a bit high, but it is Rittenhouse Square after all.  Hey, maybe those high prices can keep both our sweet tooth and cash flow in check.

Federal donuts is slowly spreading across Philly like chicken pox with people itching to get their hands on one of the homemade concoctions.

The flavors of the day ranged from snow cap to coffee cake to peanut butter malt.  At $2.75 ea, they're more than you'd pay for at the gas station, but but also significantly more satisfying.

The hot fresh flavors include cookies and cream, cinnamln brown sugar and strawberry lavender.  Since this was a MTO item, it also needed to be consumed, immediately.  Having never had a truly right off the line cake donut (specific because krispy kreme.. and yea.. they're best when fresh) I was normally disappointed with most cake donuts because they tended to be heavy and leaden and not that satisfying.  This one was superb.  Light, fluffy and still very warm.  The strawberry lavender sugar may have been the only tick.  Containing definite floral notes from the lavender, I would have preferred a stronger strawberry flavor.  Nonetheless, the donut itself was the best one I've had, even if the flavor was not.

Shortly thereafter, consumption of the fancy donuts commenced.  All donuts were cake donuts and the flavors and glazes added while they were warm allowed them to make that sugary outer crust that I love.  Favorites of the mrs. and I were the snow cap, peanut butter malt and the coffee cake.

Living very close by, the very presence of La.Va really felt like it transformed my corner of the city from a blank, quasi-gentrifying wasteland, into a real community.

Perhaps over stated, but I stand by it.  La.Va has been just about the biggest single improvement to the neighborhood since it opened and it really has become a place at which people stop being adjacently domiciled and start becoming neighbors.

All the same, my near-daily frequenting of La.Va a few years back has transitioned to my maybe having gone in once this year.   Why?  I think it just doesn't seem to have a soul.  

The few novel Israeli items are fun, but much of the israeli food-stuff is sourced from Cafe Ole--another Israeli-owned cafe which also seems to have contracts with most of the cafes in CC and the surrounding area.   So it's not really too unique.  The coffee is okay.  It's LaColombe, which is a great standard.

The Lassi flavors range from traditional to ecstatic. It's always great to bring a friend or friends to share because they always make enough to fill your cup and have enough left over to fill a smaller cup that you can trade with your friends. 

I have a hard time choosing anything other than the Pistachio/Almond Lassi. It's a great balance of rich yogurt, creamy almonds, and nutty pistachios that almost adds an umami flavor to the combination as the pistachios that they use are toasted with a bit of salt.

Because I was hosting family from out of town two weekends ago, the Tuesday before our family event I reserved a table for 11 people on Saturday night via Yelp. We planned our day around this, knowing we'd need to be in No Libs by 7.

I received a phone call to confirm at 12:30, as well as a text message and an email. Three confirmations. When I called around 3 to add one more person, I was told that it wouldn't be a problem but they appreciated the call. Lo an behold, after the 12 of us piled into Ubers and arrived, laden with a few six-packs and a bottle of tequila, we were told there was no reservation; it must have been lost. We spoke to a woman who identified herself as the manager, and with a shrug and an apology, she turned us away.

I couldn't believe this. First of all, we had planned our day around this and spent money and time on transportation to get to our reservation that had been thrice confirmed. Secondly, I was extremely embarrassed to tell my family that the nice dinner we were looking forward to and that I had planned had been cancelled without our knowing it. Finally, to be turned away without any sort of compensation, a coupon off a future visit, anything to attempt to apologize for the inconvenience, was unacceptable.

I am surprised and disappointed by this. As I mentioned in my previous review, I had always had a great experience at this restaurant. At this point, I have no plans to return and I certainly will never make a reservation for a large group again.",2016-03-23 00:45:36,"{'food': ['tacos', 'burritos', 'enchiladas'], 'drink': ['beer', 'wine', 'tequila']}"

The beef and meatball on a stick are standard quality and a bit more expensive then the regular street vendor

One bad thing was that they gave very little portion of rice knowing every Cambodian dish is eaten with rice.

Khyber Pass itself, has only been open since 1970, making it a baby in comparison. Still, the place is dark (even in the daytime), with plenty of atmosphere. 

Khyber Pass Pub also has much more than just bar food. First, they serve brunch all day. Many of those items did look tempting, but I resisted. Second, there are many New Orleans style dishes on the menu. Third, there is a chalkboard with a bunch of enticing specials every day. Do not miss these.

We started with three apps to share:  
Bacon Grease Popcorn:  I know, sounds kind of disgusting, but the popcorn did not taste greasy at all and was great!  You can also order Vegan Buttered Popcorn!
Nachos with BBQ Pulled Pork: With a green tomato salsa, this was a crispy and tasty dish. You can also get it with vegan pulled pork!
Grilled Chicken Wings with Chipotle-Bourbon BBQ Sauce-this sweet sauce was very good!

The table ordered a hodgepodge of items for mains. One little blip was that 12 year old ordered a plain cheeseburger. It came out with tons of other stuff on it so we had to send it back. He ordered more of the wings instead. My sister, who did order the Khyber Burger with all the fixings (bacon, BBQ onions, creole mustard, cheddar cheese) loved it. Husband adored his BBQ Brisket Sandwich.  11 year old had the Gumbo and found it a bit underwhelming. He thought it could have been much spicier. I went on the lighter side and tried two specials:  Sweet Potato Bisque and the Beet Watermelon Salad.   The soup did not taste like it had much if any dairy in it. It just tasted like puréed sweet potato and it was very good.  I truly enjoyed the salad as well. It was light and refreshing....perfect for a summer afternoon. 

Overall the food at Knyber Pass was varied and creative, especially for a bar!  Service was friendly but pretty slow.

Do NOT get the mussels with frites. Frites came served directly on the mussels, a few minutes in they were all soggy. I wasn't a fan of the aioli dipping sauce. Also, about half of my mussells had no meat in them, and the ones that did had little meat and were way over cooked. The broth was good as long as I didn't get bites of the chopped garlic and onions, which tasted burnt. Also there was no bread to dip into the broth. The cocktail it got as well had whiskey in it, and it pretty much just tasted like straight up whiskey, I couldn't even taste anything else, I think I would have been better off just getting it on the rocks.
I could just be spoiled.

First off, the service was super attentive and well versed. I don't remember her name. But she was short, had a ton of tattoos, a nose ring, and sweet shades.

I started off with the Sunday School Special wine, which happened to be a Malbec. An excellently smooth selection. I promptly ordered three plates: Figs & Prosciutto, Truffled Egg Toast, and Lamb Terrine.

I will describe them in reverse order of my preference.

Lamb Terrine
Served with a dry, nasaly mustard and some sweet cabbage relish, the terrine itself lacked very much flavor. I was hoping it would really highlight that funky lamb taste I've come to enjoy. It did no such thing. It was disappointingly bland. Not a bad dish, just really nothing special. 

Truffled Egg Toast
I love truffles. It seemed like this piece of buttered Texas Toast with a truffle cheese. Was it real truffles. VERY unlikely. It tasted like it had some truffle aroma in there. But it wasn't the nasty stuff. This dish was really enjoyable. Really because truffle flavor is just so darned good. This was a nicely balanced dish. I really enjoyed it. 

Figs and Prosciutto
This was the standout. Truly an incredible blend of flavors: figs, honey, and prosciutto. The figs were perfectly cooked, the prosciutto perfectly meaty and salty.

Anyhow - went there again (3rd time) last night and sat putside - which I usually never do.  It was a surprising lovely evening.  I had been here twice before for lunch - which was good but maybe only 3 or 4 stars.  

Last nite's meal solidified the 4 stars.  Service was wonderful and attentive (maybe because they are slow in the summer??).  We stated with virgin Golden Pineapple Mojitos which were truly delish.  FRESH pineapple juice and mint - perfectly balanced.

My dining companion was a close friend from out of town who walked by and wanted to go here.  She is very health conscious and ordered the salmon in a light (not too salty) black bean sauce over a crsip tender bed of TERRIFIC baby bok choi.  It was accompanied by a Cocunt ""polenta"" that was so silken it tased and felt like coconut flan.  Almost dessert like.

I had a started of an Ahi Tuna Sampler (which I have ordered before and I just love it.).  At $17 it is small and expensive - but the quality of the tuna tartare and the fabulous accompaniments make it somehow worth every delicious teeny morsel.

Instead of an entree I had the COMPOSED  $12 salad with golden beets, candied Walnuts, sliced yellow tomatoes, microgreens in a delectable, sweet but not cloying , light vinagrette.  The salad came with 5 small goat-cheese wontons - that looked like over-stuffed tortellni.

I ate 3 and gave 2 to my partner.  They really didn't do much for me.  The goat cheese inside was almost like a bleu?  Goat gorgonzola maybe?  Too strong.

But the salad and all the other compnents was terrific.

We sat down at 7:45 for an 8:00 reservation and did not receive food until 9:15. They did offer an appetizer on the house, but made us late for plans in the evening and free appetizer did not come until about 9:00. I also mentioned to the waiter that it was my date's birthday and he said I'll see what I can do. I saw three other birthdays happening around us, each got a brownie with a birthday candle and a happy birthday from the same waiter. When we were finally finished waiting for dinner for so long I'd figure she would get a nice birthday desert too. Nope, he just showed us the dessert menu. Totally forgot I even asked. The place got rather loud after 9pm too as we were sitting not too far from the bar with drunk birthday parties screaming and singing at the top of their lungs.

Like the peasants stormed the Bastille on that very day, 221 years prior, I set out to storm the shit out of Cafe Nhu Y.

I made a brave trek across the city, stopping at PNC on 6th & Spring Garden for $10 from an ATM and then down to 8th & Christian for my second bahn mi ever. I ordered a #5 (vegetarian) and a #6 (chicken) for my significant other. Both were delicious! Great success!

The rolls were crusty on the outside and soft on the inside - [insert your simile of choice here]. The tofu was deliciously marinated and flavorful, but not too LOUD in my mouth. Perfectly present. Not too wet or slippery either - I love tofu, and sometimes tofu runs the risk of becoming slippery, and I do not like slippery things in my mouth. Sick. Is this review becoming vaguely sexual? My bad, you guys. My bad. 

Anyways, I heard the chicken was good, too. The veggies were perfectly crisp and balanced. Together, all of the elements of the sandwich joined forces to create an excellent lunch. Filling but not heavy - you know I love that in a meal.

Two 12"" sandwiches for $7 is a steal. The service was pleasant and efficient - just one woman hanging out in there, making sandwiches.

OH MY GOD.

I am obsessed with this place (and it is slightly out of my price range -- ie, 10$ meals are slightly out of my price range -- and that KILLS ME).

I have been there twice.  I wish I could say I have been there eighty thousand times.

On my first trip, I got the shrimp burrito.  I didn't realize that burritos other than the ""gringo burritos"" are actually very small.  However, the shrimp burrito had AMAZING flavors (garlic mayo, tomatoes, fried chicken skins!!), and I only wish I had six more of them to keep tasting that deliciousness.  I ordered an endless chips and salsa to fill up, and the red salsa is fantastic, as are the chips.  They have very good seasoning and something faintly cheesy.

On my second trip, my friends and I ordered a pitcher of margaritas and fried pickles.  The margaritas don't stretch too far but fuck are they strong.  The fried pickles were fantastic, and the spicy mayo they're served with is literally the perfect counterbalance to their acidity.

Then, I got the fried chicken sandwich.

JUST DO IT.  A piece of fried chicken bigger than my hand, a fluffy sesame seed bun, tons of delicious mayo, a huge plate of fries, fresh bibb lettuce.  Oh god, I can't.

JUST GO.

Finally, we were led to an open dining area with live piano playing. I was enjoying the classy atmosphere, but was abruptly startled by the brashness of our server.

At first, I didn't get a great impression from our server, who didn't come off as super friendly (at least in the beginning). We told him one of us was turning 21, so we were going to get a drink after midnight, to which our server told us he couldn't serve that person until right at midnight. Obviously, he was right, but he just said this in an almost aggressive tone, so we were sort of surprised. Turns out, our server came thru and served my friend her drink right at midnight! He even put it on the house, which was super nice of him. 

We got a few appetizers, which were all great. We had the chicken liver served over bread. Our server gave us 2 extra pieces to accommodate for the fact that there were more of us than there were pieces of bread normally included in the order. The Jersey Burrata was nicely flavored, and the Smoked Chicken Wings were tasty. Finally, our server threw in a free dessert, which consisted of a super soft, flan-like, sweet cheese which was DELICIOUS. 

Pub & Kitchen really stood out to me because of the amazing experience we had with the service (although we weren't super enthusiastic to begin with).

We were taken right on time for our reservation and got a great tabel.  if possible, i suggest asking for a table in the front window.  The decor was simple but elegant.  Too many ""farm"" restaurants have pitchforks, ect on the wall.  Not here.

Food was outstanding.  Not sure that it will help to make specific recommendations since the menu changes seasonally and weekly, but everything we had was great.  I had the beetsteak, poached egg, and grilled cohiba.  Wife had fall salad, ravioli, and hanger steak.  Portion sizes were more than appropriate.  For dessert it was a chocolate cake.

What puts farm and the fisherman over the top though is its excellent service.  Wait staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  In fact, when my wife sent her hangersteak back to have it cooked a little longer, they cooked me another piece of fish so that our meals would be hot at the same time.  

We were there for our second anniversary and could not have chosen a finer spot.  I would highly recommend for any special occassion, especially romantic ones (although I must honestly say that I do not think it would be good for large parties, as there are only about 30 seats).

1) ""Food your grandmother served in the '70s"" is not really a genre I'm into, but these people kind of make the best of it. Being vegetarian should preclude me from eating much of the aforementioned genre, but Jones has their ""ALT"" - avocado, lettuce, and tomato. I find it tasty. I also like the monkey bread a lot, despite not being much of a sweet breakfast person. The bloody marys are too expensive, but okay.

2) Atmosphere is just ... unique. The order pad for the aforementioned bloody marys is one reason. The creepy bathroom stalls are another.

Meat was plentiful, too, had some for lunch the next day.  Fantastic, with ample yellow rice, accompanied with some sauteed onions and short bits of green beans (that must be the vegetables mentioned on the menu).  Wife's chix was a bit dry, but chix is lean, so that happens.  Hummus could have used more garlic, lemon juice, and salt, and yes, it is thinner than most hummuses I've had.  I liked that about it, though, considering adapting my own hummuses.  Say it three times: hummuses hummuses hummuses. Ample warm pitas accompanied, and small side salad, too, with mediterranean style olives, and oddly, a few thin slices of pickle.   They were busy, TV was blaring, college students in three small groups, but wife and I had a table to ourselves.  We both needed some salt on the food, and that's unusual in my opionion.  A definite plus for your health.  Luckily, a tray of pizza condiments is available, bearing salt shaker, pepper flakes, and parmesan too, I think.
Almost forgot the baklava.  I said I'll get two, wife said ""just get one for yourself.""  I got one bite of it, and that's all.  Women!  The one bite was good, definitely had some floral aroma, perhaps that's rose water.  Never been a fan of rosewater, but I think that's the authentic recipe.

However I was told since it was only 3 of us that we could not use the voucher. 
This did not make any sense because they could have prorated the coupon for 3 people at $12.50 each.
 However I believe the restaurant's motivation for allowing us to leave without the using voucher, is that they want each party to spend more money. Therefore if we used the voucher we would not go over the $50 limit.
They will also only allow certain menu items to be consumed with the voucher. Maybe Groupon shouldn't allow Erawan to advertise.
They displayed poor customer service and has not won me over!

qVWQMZW6_GJLgsjmjdLEeA,lgUKLRsqvhu4DbM9syzq_Q,uIZwBkvWicqyWraXvYOipw,5,4,2,2,"Months overdue, here I am finally getting around to writing my review of Sbraga. A shame because I wanted to be one of the first to alert the masses on what a wonderful addition this restaurant is to the city, now I'm just another opinionated diner amongst a flurry of other well versed yelp constituents. Pity party aside, I bring you my fantastic fall night experience of which my company of the evening Vinny P. and Christine B. have already done a stand up job in describing.

The Offering: Let it be known that the four course tasting menu is the norm at $45/pp with an optional wine pairing addition should you choose. There are also options to indulge in an 8 or 10 course meal, who can eat that much I don't know, available upon request. The full menu is offered a la carte if you can manage to find a space at the bar, however seating is limited and given that it's still difficult months after opening to grab a regular reservation you may want to consider camping out for a coveted seat come dinnertime. 

Space and Service: Give yourself time. Enjoy your experience, don't rush it, take it in. The space is warm and inviting, a modern rustic with reclaimed wood paneling and an open air kitchen which offers patrons the opportunity to see the chef and staff hard at work preparing the camera-ready dishes brought to your table. Though there are not many negatives in the reviews, the few seem to be about service being slow. There is a difference between creating an enjoyable dining experience for patrons by not rushing through four courses and slipups in communication between waitstaff and kitchenstaff. Our table of four found ourselves in a predicament where we thought that we had allowed ourselves enough time (two hours) to enjoy dinner and get to a show at the Merriam Theater. Because of a miscommunication, but not by any means the fault of our server, we were left incredibly tight for time. After bringing to our servers attention the fact that we had a schedule to keep (something I typically hate doing because why are we any more special than the rest of the diners?), we were met by the manager who handled the situation with style and grace in a manner that I have never seen offered, but one that turned a would-be rushed and unenjoyable situation into a positive experience. To say that service and customer care is lacking would be inaccurate, however in reading that months later there are still some timing issues from order placing to plate presentation find myself hoping that these can be ironed out. 

Food: I mulled over the menu for weeks leading up to our night out, sad I know, but don't pretend like you've never done the same thing in anticipation of a great meal. When push came to shove I went with a four course selection of Kevin Sbragas take on classic comfort foods, if we're going casual upscale I'm going straight up American comfort. My first course of sweetbreads was the most unconventional of the meal theme, but to keep somewhat consistent would have meant going with a caesar salad and that just seemed too safe. Of the sweatbreads I have had, sadly these just were not my favorite, somewhat heavy on breading with redemption found in the tonnato and capers which still only partially filled the textural sadness I was feeling. My second course was the fish and chips, not heavy by any means but crisp and piping hot adorned with a cumin salt and sliced jalapeno while set over lightly fried potatoes and a curry remoulade, Indian flare to a classic this could have easily been my favorite course if it weren't for the third. Let's just pause for a second so that you can understand my disgust of the word ""meatloaf"". Break it down, it's a whole loaf of meat, there's really nothing classy about it. If you backtrack to how mom made it and take out the breadcrumbs, bind it instead with veal mousse like Sbraga, and lather it with a salty but sweet bacon marmalade you're well on your way to gluttony. For dessert I rounded things out with the caramel apple mille-feuille. Though light and sweet with crisp apples and flaky puff pastry, this was sort of a bland ending to an otherwise quality meal. This is not to say that it was not full of flavor or presented beautifully because both are true, I just don't think it packed the wow factor of the previous courses.

I don't always care for prix fixe menus because you're almost forced to order items you normally wouldn't care to order. I am not always an appetizer person and almost never an orderer of dessert, I could be perfectly happy with a salad and an entree and calling it a night. I am however happy that my dining companions and I agreed to make the reservation because without them I would  be sadly sitting here reading the reviews instead of writing my own. If you are looking for a solid meal before a night at the theater, a special occasion, or just looking to splurge, this is one reservation you need not hesitate in making.",2012-02-07 21:04:30,"{'food': ['sweetbreads', 'fish and chips', 'meatloaf', 'caramel apple mille-feuille'], 'drink': []}"

Communal tables, and not too many at that.  Normally I hate communal tables, but this wasn't terrible - at least there are chairs instead of communal benches. A few places to sit around the ""kitchen"" (aka pizza oven).  A few outdoor tables as well, with heaters so they can still be utilized in the chilly autumn. No rezzies, so unless you come before 6, be prepared for a short wait.  And no great place to wait inside - we grabbed a drink from the bar (a small counter right as you walk in) and hugged the far wall where there's a small ledge, presumably for drinks, though if you stand in front of it like a bar, the people at the nearest table can't get out.

They have a pretty extensive beer list, including my favorite beer-in-cider-clothing, Anthem Hops Cider. (For those who don't know it - if you aren't a beer person but hate the sickly sweetness that too often ruins cider, Anthem Hops should be your new jam).  Unfortunately it's like $8.50, but it's so good.  A couple of wines and bottled or canned cocktails, but beer is definitely where they put their resources.

The gluten-freebie in our group got the wood oven salad and absolutely loved it - and it certainly looked delicious.  The other three of us split the arugula salad (a must-get), the Renato pizza (excellent) and the Salsiccia pizza (meh - it was fine, just didn't blow me away like the other stuff we had). As my one self-proclaimed pizza-connoisseur friend noted, their leoparding of the crust edges is perfect; but I agree with another yelper who thought the crust was soggy.  Doesn't kill the experience for me, just something to note.

Dessert was the fried dough (stop thinking about the negative nutritional value and just order it - hot, light, chewy, almost churro-like in taste, so delicious), and the cookie jar, which was sort of disappointing because all of the cookies are traditional Italian, as you would expect, but none of them were sweet and cookie-like in the way we uncouth Americans prefer.  

Best part of the whole meal: limoncello!  Order it. Sip it. Savor every moment.

What I really liked about the place was the fact that it was located on the 37th Floor and had great views of the city and surrounding areas.  You really did feel like you were in NYC as another reviewer posted. 
I loved how you checked the coat downstairs and took the private elevator to the restaurant.  We were immediately greated by a very pleasant hostess.  The bar is as others described, it was very hopping and for a Friday Happy Hour it was a great crowd. 

Our waiter came over to our table pretty quickly and he was nice BUT call it a pet peeve, he took our water order but never asked if we wanted a cocktail.  Okay...so it's FRIDAY and 6pm what's the first thing on your mind...get me a drink!  So he failed here!

We proceeded to order a 'snack' or appetizer which we asked to br brought out first, my partner ordered a salad and I ordered the soup and we each ordered our entree.  You probably guessed it already but just in case you didn't, they brought out our app and salad/soup at the same time.  They also brought the bread out at the same time as well...we felt like in 10 seconds were were bombarded from all sides!

The snack we ordered was the Rabbit Nachos...I thought they were great.  A little salty but great!  I never had rabbit before but after having this snack, I don't think I'd be afraid to order it again.

I got the onion soup and I loved the portion (not too much) but man was it super sweet...a little overwhelming actually.  I was hungry though so I did eat it all.  My partner ordered the caesar salad, I think, but he was unable to finish it though because it was way too salty.

Next I had the ribeye and when I say I make a more flavoful ribeye, I make a more flavorful ribeye.  It was a huge disappointment in my opinion.  My partner had the short ribs which were really good, they melted in your mouth.

So overall, I would totally go here for the bar especially for happy hour and probably order some apps.  For a dinner, I can think of a lot of other places to go that are twice as good for a 1/3 of the price.",2010-03-15 21:41:17,"{'food': ['Rabbit Nachos', 'Ribeye'], 'drink': []}"

She also thought the pictures of the food, the Yelp reviews and the atmosphere would be fun and interesting. That was enough to convince me. We were able to find street parking fairly close on Girard, basically across the street from Sketch Burger. 

Some review Murph's as a dive bar. Maybe things have changed a little since my time before marriage, but I would not classify Murph's as a dive bar. It is a little dark inside and had some Elvis kitsch and eclectic decorations, but it felt clean and warm.  The dive bars of my younger days were places I would only drink beer from bottles, avoided any eye contact with regulars, tried not to use the bathroom and would never order food. Murph's was none of that.

Being the Saturday before Valentines Day the small dining area in the back was crowded with over a one-hour wait for a table. This was around 6:00 PM. We grabbed a two-seat bar table by the door and took in the diverse but friendly patrons. After a short wait our server/bartender gave us menus and took our drink orders. Murph's has a very good selection of beers for a smaller bar and the pricing was pretty fair also.

As others before me have written, it is surprising that an Irish bar serves excellent Italian food, but Murph's really does. We started with the meatballs and they were flavorful with a great tasting homemade sauce and a Ricotta cheese scoop. I had the tortellini with roast beef and a spicy tomato sauce. That was also delicious and contained just enough heat. The dish was not overly heavy either. My daughter had the Murph's pasta in a beer, cheese and cream sauce with bacon. It is hard to go wrong with these ingredients but the dish had refined feel also. It was excellent.

Our service was great all night. We had some interesting banter about music and Rose bushes with some of the regulars.  Prices for food were reasonable also.

I searched the website (btw, don't let the site fool you, the food is brilliant) and I can't find it on there; but anyway, it was a guinea fowl dish on top of some really delicious rice/stew business that was just... wow. I dunno if everyone else who was with me was impressed with what they got, but I certainly know that mine looked beautiful in terms of presentation, and it tasted divine. I did try bites of some of the other dishes, and there was one dish that was something like a stew (possibly the rabbit?) that I absolutely did not like because the taste of cinnamon overpowered everything else that was going on in the dish. As far as appetizers go, we really enjoyed the different dips, which were all distinct in flavor, and most of our conversation until the arrival of our entrees was an argument about which one was the best.

The service was great, which really it better be because the place never seems busy. Although, I think our waiter was annoyed at me because I asked him for his opinion, and then completely ignored it and picked something else. While I don't regret my choice, I can see why that might come off as a d*ck move, and therefore don't hold it against the guy if he was actually annoyed by me.

A good place for a first date I guess, when you are too nervous to think about the quality of your food. It's also on a trendy, up-and-coming block in West Philly, so that might add to the popularity.
The food was simply average, the prices too high, and service almost non-existent. I was very disappointed in this place and won't go back.
I went there for lunch and got to the point where I started to wonder if the waiter had forgotten about me, and the other customers waiting. The soup was too salty, the dumplings too doughy and without enough ""stuff"" in them to give them flavor, and the chicken basil was too dry. The veggies just average. Since I mentioned the chicken basil I should add it wasn't even what I ordered. I ordered the shrimp. I didn't say anything, because a.) I was really indifferent about which of the four (veggie, shrimp, beef, chicken) I got, and b.) I didn't want it to be a hassle, and I certainly didn't want the wait to be even longer. So I didn't say anything. At the end, the waiter realized he gave me the wrong dish, and took 10% off the chicken price. Whatever. Had he appeared while I was eating to either refill my water, or ask me how my lunch was I would have said something and added, ""no biggie, just don't charge me the higher shrimp price"".
Mistakes happen, no problem. 
The prices are a few bucks higher than what they should be. If this place was in some generic suburban strip mall, I think most of the positive reviewers would trash this place, but since it is in a hipster neighborhood people say it's great.

Women looked at George and said ""well, since he dated one of us he must be a stud"". Same deal here, put a place in a cool neighborhood and somehow people think the food tastes better.

My wife and I tried every one of their tacos.  In general, the fried fish/shrimp tacos are the way to go.  I wouldn't recommend their meat tacos.

The fried fish tacos are pretty good.  Not as good as what you can find in southern California (where I grew up).  And about half the size.  For about 1.5x the price.  But still pretty good, especially for Philadelphia.  I think it's because they do the batter well.  I don't understand why people like grilled fish tacos, but if that floats your boat, then go for it.

The meat tacos are not good.  I'm all for quality ingredients, but I draw the line at trying to yuppify a classic.  C'mon, you can't serve a taco without cilantro, raw onions, and lime.

They talk about making the tortillas fresh, but by the time the food comes out, the tortillas are not warm, nor is the fish/meat inside.  Maybe that's just because they seemed to have some service issues though.

It's the first week, so I'm sure things will get better.  But we did not enjoy the ambiance in there.

No domestic crap, though. I like that! Plus, there's Original Sin hard cider for Juliet. I dig in with a Sixpoint Sweet Action from Brooklyn. It's a strange, creamy amber kind of brew with malty characteristics but relatively innocuous. Later I move on to a Sprecher Black Bavarian which is much more suited to my palate, dry and dark, with licorice undertones without being sweet. It has depth. I end with the PBC Walt Wit (recommended by good buddy Obijohn from his visit to Mac's only the week previous), a traditional and tasty Belgian-style white beer with grapefruit notes. Good one to finish with.

Originally, we plan for a light lunch. There are too many good choices, however, so we do our usual routine of ordering a couple starter dishes to share, then moving on to mains. Despite Obijohn's advice to avoid Mac's Macs, there's no way I'm going to convince Juliet to skip it. The fusilli pasta is baked in a four cheese sauce, then topped with crumbles of honey-barbecue corn chips. One bite and we are sold. The medley of cheese and sweet-salty topping sends my taste buds into the stratosphere. We demolish it. Likewise, Mac's House gravy fries--braised short rib shredded atop a mound of steak fries covered in gravy, topped with provolone and horseradish--are crazy good. And monstrous. There are way too many to finish, though we do our best.

For my main, I choose Sweet D's Sausage & P's. It's a classic hoagie filled with sliced sweet sausage, sauteed bell peppers, and onions in a thick tomato sauce. It's also nearly impossible to eat as a sandwich; I have to knife-and-fork it after several failed attempts to chaw on it, sausages slipping out from the bread onto my plate.

We hang around, sipping our drinks and picking at the food. I would classify the menu as ""elevated tavern fare"". There's something about Mac's that makes me feel right at home. It would be easy to waste an entire day there, drinking, talking, and munching on goodies.

Cute little nook of a place nestled right on the corner.

-- Toad in a hole: Hollandaise soaked challah, poached egg, jack cheese, truffle oil 
This was delicious and if you like poached eggs and are looking for a change to the normal eggs benedict (which is a fav of mine) this is a great option!  It is loaded with cheese!
--and Strawberry banana French toast for the table which was a weekly special
Honest;y, I really wanted to like this French toast but it lacked luster if you will...It sounded much better than it tasted.  It was a bit bland and not very sweet.

The hostess is set-up in the entryway as there's no room in the actual restaurant.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table and there is really nowhere to wait.  We lined-up against the back wall between the few bar seats in the back but were constantly in the way.  Now this was during the winter and it was raining - so people couldn't wait outside and everyone had large jackets taking up space.

We thought we would eat a late lunch/early dinner and hit this place during ""off"" hours - not to be.  We got there around 2:30 or 3 and still had to wait, BUT it was well worth it.  We had a couple cocktails which were amazing (great cocktail list along with the beer & obviously whiskey) then settled into the food.

We had the house-made cheese puffs which were light and simply perfect.  We also sampled the spicy popcorn shrimp which were amazing as well.  The herb cherry tomato pickles were quite possibly one of the best things I've ever had in my life (and for $4?!)  I recently stumbled upon the recipe for this online, so do a search and try them yourself.  The tomato pickles are served with sourdough bread, olive tapenade, & whipped ricotta cheese.  Honestly, the serving size of this would be enough for a light lunch for one or a single appetizer for two.

On to the main attraction - the burger.  Yes, it is as good as everyone says.  Yes, its worth the wait.  My wife & I split the Whiskey King (8oz burger with maple glazed cipollinis, bleu cheese, applewood bacon, & foie gras).  Man was it messy but damn was it good...I think that should be their t-shirt...

We also ordered their duck fat french fries with sly fox cheddar cheese sauce.  I believe I read someone else saying that you would feel guilty after leaving this place....which is true...and you also don't need to go here if you're on a diet.  That said its well worth every bite, calorie, fat gram, etc.  I'm not sure what the crowds are like at night, but I'm sure they are large.  What I can say is that the food is simply outstanding - Jose Garces does it again.

Within a few minutes, they are there to take your order and a few minutes thereafter, your sheesha is brought to your table.

They have a whole variety of flavors but I just stick to my rotation of Cherry-Mint and Watermelon-Mint.  Their mint tea is also fresh, piping hot and flavorful - its authentic mint tea.  They have cappuccino as well which is delicious.  No really diverse food or dessert offerings so plan to eat before or after!

Its a small place but the tables are evenly spaced so you are not sitting on top of other people - perfect place to chill out, smoke a pipe and hang out with a group of friends.

We went today at my son's request and the best thing I can say is that he really enjoyed his burger.  To start, we ordered onion rings and when they arrived the portion was 7 small rings ($3.99).  When I asked about it, the waitress said they were pre-portioned. There were a larger number of staff milling about the kitchen and one of them jumped in to say that was actually a half order, so she said she'd bring us more.  Where the first batch was tasty and crispy, the second batch was soggy and undercooked - not even edible.  When we complained, the server gave us a blank stare.  Eventually the drinks came, strangely filled not to the top and (and also strangely with very little ice).  Coke was delivered instead of Diet Coke.  

When the meals came and the kids realized that fries didn't come with, we added two orders of fries.  We also asked for some yellow mustard.  The server said fine and returned to say she would comp the fries since we didn't like the onion rings.  Great! 5 minutes later, we went searching on our own for mustard.  After another 5 minutes, the meal concluded, she came by asking if we wanted our check.  Um, what happened to the fries?!?  We told her never mind and just give us the check.  She did - without deducting the onion rings (but at least not adding fries we didn't get), and we  paid in cash.  She returned incorrect change ($5 instead of $8).  When I complained and said it was ridiculous on top of the onion ring thing, she went to get the manager.  

I waited and waited.  When the manager did return, and said she'd take care of it and remove the onion rings, she handed me THE SAME $5 CHANGE!  What?!  At this point, I raised my voice, demanding my proper change.  When she did, she made excuses and then she asked whether there was anything else she could do.

it had rave reviews, and the menu looked wonderful, so we made reservations for our special night with blind faith..

first off, I want to share that we had a wonderful evening and the food was really excellent!!  

however, we had a rough start, as the place was packed and though very aesthetically pleasing to the eye, our ears were miserable as it was so loud we couldn't here each other speak!  my father has a hearing aid, so it was especially bad for him.  we were hoping for a nice intimate dinner after our sweet wedding rehearsal and we were having to yell across the table to say anything to each other, then repeat it a couple times...  i asked if we could move outside, and the hostess said she would see what she could do, as they were fully booked. 

it took a long time, but eventually the manager offered that they could move a couple indoor tables that had just emptied outside for us and squeeze us into the outdoor seating area.  we opted for that as staying inside was so miserable.  they set us a lovely table and as we sat down in the peace and quiet of the outdoors, you could see the look of relief in everyone's face.  our food came soon after and it was absolutely delicious!  high quality, expertly prepared and beautifully presented.  our waitress was wonderful and took very good care of us and the manager was sincerely wanting us to have a good experience, which we did.  we enjoyed wonderful conversation the rest of the evening, and everyone went home very happy.
will definitely go back, but reserve an outdoor table every time!!  

*for vegetarians:   the menu does change often and was different from when we made the reservation where there were more veg dishes.  there was only one option for us that night, but it was an excellent option.  call ahead o see the menu choices for the current week.  I would hope the chef decides to put a couple more veg items on the menu regularly, as good veg restaurants of this type of food are hard to come by outside of the city ; )",2012-07-18 16:45:22,"{'food': ['vegetarian'], 'drink': []}"

Salsa- Uh, hmmm. We don't serve Pico De Gallo as salsa back home. It is usually to spice up a taco, or burrito, or taco salad or something. They also served verde salsa. Both were not bad, kinda tasty actually. Just not what I know as Tex-Mex.

Burritos- I ordered the Carnitas. They were good, but kind of small for 10 bucks. More like a taco than anything. I will try the enchiladas next time(oh yes, there will be a next time).

Taco salad-(my friend ordered this) HUGE. And my friend loved it, she got it with shrimp.

Margaritas- Not bad. Not bad at all. And only $5!!!
Also, Sunday-Thursday, they have half-priced draught beers and margaritas from 10pm-midnight. Can I get a what what?

Dry Fry Style Pork is the best!!!

Portion sizes are pretty big, family style is best so you can try more foods. It can be pretty pricey ($15-20 per person depending what you order and how much people eat). Common staple found at every table were the dan dan noodles. I ordered this to-go before and it didn't taste as good, so eat this dine-in! Their scallion pancakes are very authentic and super yummy.

Pros
-Drinks - old-timey, hand mixed cocktails were uniformly cold and delicious.  We sampled the Old Fashioned (stiff), Sazerac, Jerry Lewis (much like the Sazerac) and the Newcomer, which may have been the best being a rye riff on a margarita.
-Food - the burger, which I took as is with boston bibb, tomato and thousand island, made me a little high with each bite. Not too big, not too small, perfectly cooked. And you can dress up it really fancy if you like with foie gras, bacon, avocado and a number of rich toppings.  The much ballyhooed French Fries were good, but I somehow expected more. I honestly prefer the belgian-style frites at Euology.
-Atmosphere - I was expecting a mad crowd, but 9pm on a Tuesday night provided a chill window with just the right crowd in this small restaurant. We also witnessed who may be Philly's version of the Most Interesting Man in the World coolest old rich guy - decked out in stylish threads and flanked by a pair of delicate geisha-like companions 1/3 his age, taking down a burger and slipping out with a nod from the bartender.

My husband and I graced Kanella with our food-lovin' presence last weekend. Kanella is a quaint little BYOB, so pop in to The Foodery only about two blocks away and make your own six pack to take to Kanella with you.

The second that we walked into Kanella, we were greeted by a smiling, genuinely welcoming and friendly hostess who seated us right next to the window. She immediately commented on our selection of beers that we brought, and mentioned that most people bring wine into Kanella and how it was refreshing to see some beer lovers walk through the door. I immediately loved this hostess, even before she pulled a metal bucket full of ice over to our table so that we could chill our beers and take bottles as we needed them. 

The service at Kanella is efficient, yet relaxing at the same time. For a place that is so small, the task of wielding large plates of food while weaving through a tight seating area in the middle of a restaurant is a feat for those with amazing coodination. Our server came over and cracked open our first beers for us and asked us if we'd like to order an appetizer. My husband and I already knew what we wanted for an appetizer and entrees, so we ordered both dishes. For the appetizer, we picked the dips of the day, which are three dips randomly selected by the chef and prepared in-house. Ours came with an eggplant, garlic potato, and bean dip. The whole time we were ripping off pieces of pita bread and dipping them into each dip, we were trying to decide which dip was our favorite and we couldn't. They were all so delicious. 

For my entree, I ordered the Pouleriko, which is free-range, organic cornish hen that comes with some veggies and potatoes. My husband had the mousaka. Each bite melted in our mouths, and I have never tasted such flavorful food in my life. 

For dessert, we split the classic chocolate tart. Even though we were both stuffed from the appetizer and our entrees, we just had to try another one of this chef's creations. Stuffing ourselves to the point of no return was completely worth it. The chocolate tart puts all other desserts to shame. I will look at all pieces of pie, cake, and scoops of ice cream with a look of inferiority from now on, simply because they will not live up to the dessert perfection of the classic chocolate tart. 

What was so nice about Kanella is that we could tell that they appreciate their customers, and they want them to sit and enjoy. In a world where people are prone to grab ""a quick bite"" for every meal, it was so refreshing to sit down and savor a two-hour long dinner. The servers give you a few minutes between each course before they bring out another course, giving you some time to digest and talk.

I arrived on my check in date running late (especially for business event). Traffic on 95 North was horrible. I came into Loews looking a bit out of it. However, the staff at the check-in (with smiles) did ask if there was anything they could do to ease my stress. I was also met with the VIP Manager Adeline, who was super nice and gave me to minute to collect myself. She offered water, I think tea, but I was fine.  

Though my room was paid room for, I still had to provide a card for $50 to be taken out for incidentals. Cool. My room was a corner room on the 18th floor with a GORGEOUS view of Market St.and beyond. Windows all around. To my left was City Hall and directly in front was Market St/The Marriot and all of Philly beyond Market St.  I was greeted with a lovely note from Adeline, a complementary package of chocolate covered pretzels, Fiji water and a bottle of root beer.  The king size bed was super comfy. I slept GOOOOD! The bathroom was beautiful. I felt really at home in my room. 

The (valet) parking was a bit steep. $36 plus tax  just for that one night stay. Also, the inviting party had made reservations for me at Sole Food, the hotel restaurant, for breakfast the next morning. However, I actually did a light fare after dinner the night before with drinks. Everything was delicious with good strong drinks. The staff is always ready and eager to assist you, esp. if you look lost. Catching a cab to my event from the hotel was a breeze and the doorman was a true professional and a gentleman.

One time I came here with a friend for her birthday and she ordered the whiskey king burger that comes with foie gras; she specifically ordered it without foie gras because she can't stand it (and told the waitress as such) and it of course the order was screwed up and came out with it. 

Side note they don't take reservations and usually have about a 2-3 hour wait on the weekends. On the bright side they will take your number down, text you when your table is ready, and give you a 15 minute window to get back to the restaurant to claim your table. Plenty of time to go to another bar nearby and grab a few drinks to kill some time.",2016-06-02 17:54:19,"{'food': ['burger', 'fries', 'tater tots', 'mac and cheese'], 'drink': ['whiskey', 'beer']}"

I love the neighborhood. Fishtown is so up and coming and the place to be, so I like that you can grab food here and then head to Frankford Hall or the barcade.  The food, however, wasn't anything spectacular and quite frankly, a little over priced.  We got 2 appetizers, $10 each and 3 entrees.  We each got a drink (3 total) and we spent $33 each (including tip).  That isn't outlandish for a Friday night dinner, but it's weird to pay that when you're having an Italian meal in an un-air conditioned dive bar.

Last week was my first time there after becoming vegan, and I felt like I made a huge mistake. Most of the vegan menu is gone - the only real options were eggplant + 1 sandwiches, which are usually good, but not worth getting here from what I've heard.

I ended up getting the vegan GG special (vegan cheesesteak) and a slice of vegan sausage pizza to share with a friend, and to try out the pizza.

After only a few minutes, the food arrive - much faster than expected - but only to a substantial level of disappointment. The pizza had crispy protein bits and what seemed to be Betty Crockers Bac Os imitation bacon bits - a little trashy, IMO. Also, a real lack of vegan cheese was saddening.

The GG special also left a lot to be desired. Made in the blandest way possible, it made me start to think they were phasing out the veg*n portion of Gianna's.  The TVP was prepared all wrong and they must have had a shortage of vegan cheese because there was pretty much none on it.

To add insult to injury, my friend needed to use the the bathroom and noticed there was no TP so she kindly asked the girl at the counter for some. After saying there was none she went back to watching March Madness on TV.

Two problems: the portions are very small and the customer service is horrendous. 

I ordered the TBM for dinner and thought ""oh for $5-6 the half is plenty!"" I feel like there was two bites and my sandwich was gone. My breakfast wrap was the same way. I'm not looking for a gigantic serving size, but these portions are tiny. 

Both trips to this location the service was awful.

When my food came out I thought the gentleman said a totally different number and when I asked him what number he said he called my number.

Kanella platter for a little bit of everything. The stuffed grape leaves are really lemony, and the veggies in the side salads are always fresh. 

Shakshouka- this is a dish I crave. Like I'm craving right now at 8pm on a Wednesday. It's comforting but doesn't weigh you down, and I love to soak up all of the tomatoey, peppery, yolky goodness with the za'tar spiced wheat bread they give. The trick is to submerge pieces of bread into the sauce, wait a while, and like a sponge they soak up all of the sauce to create perfect little bites. Once in a while, my eggs will be a tad overcooked, but I'm not too picky about that.

so I'm clearly the odd one out here. I guess what it comes down to for me is I'm not wowed by the food. Let's break it down. 

For me the food is good, but not great. This time around I got the chicken fingers and hush puppies. The breading on the chicken doesn't have strong flavor nor is it very crispy. It's not mushy either. Just kind of soft, I think. The ranch dipping sauce was okay. The hush puppies though - they were really good. A friend of mine got the chicken fingers, she wasn't wowed either. Although, she did have matzo ball soup and loved it. I will say Honey's does have awesome biscuits. But biscuits alone can not entice me. In my opinion, mediocre chicken fingers aren't worth $13. Also, I find the menu to be a little lackluster. Breakfast or burgers is really the fare. For me, it's slightly better than diner food and you pay way more. 

The ambiance is eh. It's cool but it's like any hipster city place. 

Service is also eh. This time our waiter was awesome. Quick on refills, checked in often but didn't hover. Last time before that I got a girl with a big attitude who took forever to come around.

Why Citi Marketplace rules.

1. It's inexpensive and it's 2009, we're in a recession, people! And you get what you pay for, as far as size, taste, and quality are concerned.
2. It's the only place I know of in town that makes veggie cheeseteaks and chicken steaks other than Gianna's. 
3. And here, I have the pleasure of talking to the happy, friendly group of people working behind the counter, instead of the lone, angry looking hipster at Gianna's. And Citi has air-conditioning.
4. Beyond the counter there's an excellent selection of grocery items. I didn't even get to venture beyond the front third of the aisles, but next time (before the week is through) I will definitely explore. I saw Salt & Pepper chips and this filled me with glee.
5. MAGAZINES! A great selection. 
6. Their menu is extensive, beyond vegetarian options. Salads, breakfast options, etc. Yes!

And since I can't think of a better way to spend my lunch break than eating a reasonably-priced veggie club and reading magazines in a comfortable, welcoming, air-conditioned shop, Citi takes the cake.",2009-08-05 19:58:23,"{'food': ['veggie cheeseteaks', 'chicken steaks', 'salads', 'breakfast options'], 'drink': []}"

From vegan patties to black bean to elk to goat to your typical beef patties, you have a good range to choose from that will fit everyone's eating habits/morals.

The sweet potato fries and onion rings are really yummy and definitely feed two people. If you are getting them, it will last your two meals- or be your whole meal. I also love that you get 4 different types of sauces when you order. I LOVE sauces. 

Yes it is a little pricey if you are basing it off the fact that they are burgers- BUT you need to remember all their meats are free range, pasture-raised and hormone/antibiotic free. So YES you have to pay a few $$ more for the good of society. If you have a problem with the price then go eat at McDonald's.

I would definitely recommend the El Matador if you can handle some spice (it's not too bad though). The other pre-made burgers options look great too. I would choose those over making one of my own and be boring. BE DIFFERENT. Try something a little out there.

Again, having grown up on Long Island, New York, near the ocean, I was taken back to bucolic times, of grilled fish, more carefree times.

I understand restaurants can be chaotic and there are often very legitimate reasons that an experience at a restaurant isn't the one you imagined. That said, I also know that if I wasn't a server (as all my guests weren't) this review would likely not be even three stars.

First, I decided to take a group of nine people here for a celebratory dinner recently. It's a large group, so I understand that this isn't an easy feat - I've been in the server's shoes before myself. But, of course, I chose Ralph's because quite a few of my friends (lifelong Philly residents) suggested it as the type of place that could deal with this very well. 

We were seated on the second level in a space that is gorgious and very well maintained room. 

Food was okay - very traditional American-Italian fare. I had no problems with it at all, I wouldn't say it's pushing the culinary envilope, but it tasted good, and ultimately that's what we all wanted.

Where I take issue is with the service. Interestingly it appears all large groups are seated on the second level. Obviously, working in the business, I know this is a bad idea - especially in such an old building with loud accoustics, it just means you are gonna have a lot of people all trying to talk.

We were seated right next to a group of 8-9 people, which in turn was seating in front of 10-12 (people kept coming and going) us and our neighbors tried to be respectful, the third table in the room included multiple people who were screaming and laughing at a redicules volume. I couldn't even talk to my uncle across the table from me (maybe 3 feet away from me, at Max) at times. I understand that servers are often expected to put up with whatever and never, ever, suggest patrons are in the wrong, but I also know that part of the job is being able to politely suggest a table refrain from screaming at the table, especially if they are clearly bothering the other tables in the room.

Service was also rather odd. There were two servers that were servicing the whole room, but there was no rhyme or reason behind the service. One took the drink order, another the food order, and after that I had to get up and talk to them if I wanted anything else. I get that only three of use were drinking - my parents don't drink, my grandmother is in her late-80s and doesn't drink, my Aunt is an ex-alcoholic, etc) so we weren't really the cash cow they thought when they saw a 9-person reservation coming in - it still ticked me off especially when I had to get up and find our servers not once, but twice within half an hour of finishing the main course so we could get dessert menus (and then again so we could order dessert). 

I would have talked to a manager but by the end of it all my guests were rather embarrassed because they felt incredibly out of place. Honestly, they are really amazing people who did not even want me to go to a server when we had a mix up on the order. But while I have a lot of patience as a two-year vet of the industry, when that runs dry I find poor service to be grating.

This is a novel, but as a server I hope management can use it to look at their policies and training. And I hope other guests can use it to see what the experience can be like. As I said, I would rate the food a 4/5, and am not against perhaps visiting again, provided with a smaller group (preferably downstairs) if others suggest it - but I'm certainly not rushing back or encouraging my friends to book large tables there.",2018-02-13 03:43:31,"{'food': ['traditional American-Italian fare'], 'drink': []}"

As a grad student who doesn't buy into food hype, I had to veto all of those options.  We settled on Jones, which turned out to be pretty decent.

For a little more money than Cracker Barrel, Jones offers homestyle favorites with an upscale flair. We had the chicken and waffles. steak frites, and build your own salad.  

The salad was a complete gimmick. It seemed kind of outrageous that a salad tailored to my exact specifications (i.e. one that I would make at home for $2) cost $14, more than many of the entrees.  At least it was tasty and well proportioned.

The fried chicken was excellent, probably the best fried chicken I've had in Philly, but the waffles were soaked in gravy and ended up more flaccid than a Jonas brother. 

As for the steak frites, the opposite held true, as the fries were excellent but the steak (a cut which resembled a large dog turd) was overdone.  The herb-butter pats and minced onion on top saved the dish.

Finally, like almost all Steven Starr joints, the drink menu, decor, and service were excellent. Perfect for a summery Saturday night.

The great thing is instead of holding a buzzer, or waiting to hear your name called over the crowds, VW takes your phone number, and calls you once a table is near available (10-15 minutes).

Upon entering the black curtain, you begin to understand why such seating delays are the norm. I would be very surprised if the place seats more than 60 (including the bar). The intimacy of VW is nice though, and the ambiance was well-receipted. A nice mature energy and vibe is instantly obtained. The bar display with all of their choice whiskey and scotch selections is quite a sight to see.

The whiskey menu is larger than the food menu which is a nice change of pace. It's nice to see condensed menus, of which showcases what is exceptional, instead of having 5-6 pages of moderate prepared items. Rumor had it that VW had the best burger on the East Coast, so I was ready to test that theory.

Service was solid (not too outgoing, but efficient) My burger of choice was an adhoc option with a fried egg, bacon, and Rogue bleu cheese. The toppings are very generous, which is good for the appetite, but made it challenging to eat as a burger. The Bleu cheese combined with the rareness of the beef really brought out a great taste. Although I was quite pleased with the burger, I would still rather stick with a few DC burger establishments as my top tier.

The Duck Fat Fries were equally impressive, as the sweet/salty combo is a real treat. The serving portion was perfect, as many places bombard you with starch, which VW only fills a small cup.

The whiskey tastings (1 oz per) were impressive, and the tasting sheet/place holder was very informative.  Although the beer selection is small, the choices by the beverage manager show a great knowledge, and really pair well with the menu.

Prices are very affordable, and I was surprised that they don't charge more for their great product.

We were still clinging to restaurant week, but have been let down on so many occasions.  Bummer. 

We started off with drinks, and there is something off about the drinks here. I can't place it, but they just taste awful, and we had three different drinks. The worst was the blood orange martini. It tasted so flat and bland and almost watered down. The Pepino, the jalapeño/cucumber/basil beverage should have been packed with flavor, but fell flat with just heat and little actual taste. It was the best of the three. I then tried the cherry grand marnier drink, can't remember the name as recommended by the manager--again it fell flat and though it had been described to me as ""sweet"" it was not at all. I could taste the alcohol hardcore, but little else. I suspect they are using low quality tequilas and charging top shelf prices, but that's just my theory. 

We placed our order-- guac that we customized, cheese empanadas, mexican flatbread, two vegetable sopas and the churros and chocolate tres leches cake for dessert. Our guac arrived and again, I only tasted the heat of the habanero that we had requested. We also asked for spanish onions, roasted garlic and tomatoes. I have made better guacamole whilst drunk. BLAND city. I even squeezed a lime in it form my drink to brighten the flavor, nothing. It was also way too smooth, like they had a vat of pureed avocado in the back and were just adding things in quickly. The chips also needed more salt. 

Next, we received our entrees instead of our apps. When the guy (not our waiter) put them down in front of us we were all ""nope, didn't get apps yet"" and he was all ok, bye and left the entrees there. Uh what? The manager did come over and apologize and offer us a free drink for the mistake, encourage us to eat meal in reverse. We did, and it kind of ruined the whole night since we filled up like crazy on the heavy entree. We then waited quite some time for our apps. The empanadas were the only amazing part of the meal. The flatbread had an odd mouthfeel to it, was greasy and again lacked flavor. We waited awhile again for our desserts and our waiter was mostly MIA for the entire meal.  Finally dessert.

The thing about gianna's that I think people forget is that it is a pizza and cheesesteak place- it ain't no swanky restaurant. The food you are ordering (while vegan) is still pizza joint quality. That being said, I think the quality is just fine. But if you aren't in the mood for a greasy cheesesteak- ordering a vegan one will not make it any better for you- it just means there are no animals involved. 

They make a range of YUMMY yummy ridiculously good vegan cakes/desserts that are served at other local vegan joints- to such an extent that they are actually out of them most often (but you can order them from their websites) you can also order your takeout/delivery online which is great. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, Gianna's is a pizza joint- with vegan options- and they are delicious, but just because they are vegan doesn't make them healthy. The two are mutually  exclusive- but can overlap at times depending on what you get.

ie. french fries with soy cheese on them and a bbq vegan chicken cheesesteak is not going to be your fountain of health.

There was one seat left at the bar when my boyfriend and I walked in, we asked if we could grab a chair from one of the hightops, the host went a grabbed another bar stool from somewhere near the door and brought it around for us.
The cocktail menu has really interesting options and an extensive array of high end liquor- not that I know anything about them- but it was fun to look through for sure.  I had a cocktail I think was called a Rita Mae, which was nice and orange-y followed by something with grapefruit I think. BF had a bourbon drink which tasted like pure smoke! Great cocktails. 
The couple next to us was fun to chat with and they were basically making up their own cocktails with the help of our fantastic bartender, D.

I had the standard burger, and after asking the waitress if the french fries were really worth getting (and being assured they were great!), I ordered a SIDE of FF.  That was a mistake----  they were old, limp, and cost $2.85 for a handful.  I love FF, and I didn't even eat half of them, even at that price. 
I don't mind 6 oz burgers; not everyone wants a half-pound of meat.  But the prices, especially for just the standard beef burger, were ridiculous given that they are regular-sized burgers. The meat burger combinations run anywhere from $10 - $13, and that's with no real side.  Everything, even an additional different sauces, is a la carte. So you're best off not trying to put your own combination together.
I didn't bother ordering anything to drink because I knew just the basic burger and the side of limp fries were already going to be running me at least $18 with tax and tip, so I too got the small glass of lukewarm water like another reviewer mentioned.
I couldn't help but sit there and think fondly of Bobbi's Burgers in University City. I realize that they're not stocking all the unusual meats, but if you're looking for a beef or chicken or turkey burger, the prices and certainly the french fries are are definitely better, and the combos are somehow easier to follow, inspired, and tempting. A carousel of 4 different sauces sit on the counters and tables, to be used on burgers or fries, as you wish,  AND FOR FREE.

If this were an average priced hotel I would give it 5 star, but since it advertises itself as a luxury hotel and is quite expensive (I paid $260 per night with tax, and that was with my conference discount!), my expectations are understandably somewhat higher.  I will say I did very much enjoy my stay, but was it worth $260 per night for 4 nights? Not really. Also watch out for the $45 a night valet parking (what?!) and park down the street at 12th and sansom in a self-park garage for a much more reasonable rate ($18-25/24 hr).  The hotel is very conveniently located a block away from the convention center and reading terminal market, subway stations.

So the rooms are quite elegant and modern looking.  I love the sleek and elegant design, and the rooms on the upper floors have amazing views of the city.  It took me forever to find the keurig coffee maker but it was hidden in the cabinet under the TV.  I had a large king size bed and a large desk that could sit 2 people, and the bathroom was also quite spacious.  We did have free wi-fi which was nice (upto 3 devices at a limited speed).  The thermostat/temp control seemed to work pretty well.

The hotel does have a nice bar downstairs (Bank and Bourbon) which also serves drinks in the lobby area, which is a nice area to hang out, though the cocktails are a little pricey.  Sometimes the lobby has infused water, which is nice, but that was quite inconsistent.  The pool (a 2 lane lap pool) and fitness center facilities were quite nice, but the one day I made it down to the pool to swim laps, a few minutes later it was taken over by a hoard of small children who didn't understand the concept of a lane pool, and their parents provided them no direction in this, which was quite frustrating.  There were 2 lanes and no one was in the other lane so I would've been fine with them staying in that lane, although they were noisy and boisterous, but they were jumping in on both sides (jumping also wasn't permitted) and they were swimming all over both lanes and even walking on top of the lane dividing down the middle and blocking my path when I was trying to swim back and forth.  Their parents were just sitting in the chairs around the pool fully dressed and staring, but not directing their kids, which just added to the awkwardness.  But I felt like the hotel should have stepped in too and provided some direction about what the pool was meant for. 

I found the cleaning service a bit lacking for such a luxury hotel.  Spots of my room and the hallways were quite dusty, especially the bathroom and hallways outside (where I could see quite a few dustbunnies and a layer of dust!).  They also didn't fill the toiletries each day, although I used them. I usual like taking a sample home of the shampoo/conditioner at some of the nicer hotels since they provide high quality samples but they didn't provide more each day as most hotels do (I was there 4 days).  Also, the bathroom started out with a nice white fluffy mat that was very cozy to walk on.  Unfortunately I dropped a few drops of coffee on it the first morning.  I thought they might clean it, but instead they replaced it with a really thin crappy white mat that was fraying on the edges and it would slide around everywhere and not stay in place (not safe!).  I felt like they were punishing me for spilling something on the other one, which just seemed incredibly rude, but either way it was quite poor quality material for a luxury hotel. 

Then my last day I find that they left me all decaf coffee!! I call but no one comes for 15 min so I ask the maids outside if I can have some regular coffee.  They tell me they have been out of regular coffee for 2 days and can't give me any.  Seriously?! There's a 711 across the street, there is no excuse for being out of coffee.  I would've have gone to get some myself but I was still packing and getting dressed and ready to leave and check out and had limited time.  After a few call backs from the front desk we finally get it sorted out and someone brings me a few keurigs (I suppose they had some stashed somewhere after all).  Definitely not what I expect at a luxury hotel, but glad they finally fixed the problem after a half hour (not a pleasant half hour when you enjoy a coffee to get going in the morning).

In sum, this is a pretty nice hotel and I enjoyed my stay, but a few areas I felt were lacking to make it worth the luxury name and price.",2015-03-20 22:36:55,"{'food': [], 'drink': ['keurig coffee maker', 'free wi-fi', 'infused water']}"

The restaurant is in the heart of South Philly. Once you walk in, you'll immediate say, ""this is the most colorful restaurant I've ever seen."" It's unlike most Indian restaurants I've been. The decorations are modern and fun. My friend also enjoyed the easy-listening Indian music they played.

While the menu is limited compared to other Indian places, Chaat and Chai offers carefully thought-out dishes that (i) made my Indian friend miss her home and (ii) expanded my Indian food's horizon. Chicken Tikka Chaat sounds great, but sadly it wasn't available. So we opted for Samosa Chaat, Kerala Beef Short Ribs, and Chettinad Chicken Curry Bowl. The short ribs came in Indian-style tacos, served with pickled carrots. This is a must! The curry bowl was huge. Soft basmati rice was already inside the bowl underneath the hearty curry. The flavor is a good mix of Indian and Thai. (It appears that this type of curry is not commonly offered at other places.) We also got Raita (yogurt) and garlic pickles to go with our food. The latter is interesting in a good way (a bit spicy/salty, not too sour); I'd come back to try lime pickles as well.

Bonus: For refreshing beverages, get Indian Cola (Thumbs Up) and Lemon-Lime Soda (Limca)!

Only complaints are (i) it's a bit far (read as I'm a lazy person) and (ii) I wish they serve Kheer (rice pudding) as a dessert.

It's not often that we venture out to Society Hill so kudos to finding a reason to visit this part of town.  We got there for dinner around 9ish or so and sat down.  What struck me about the place was how much effort they put into their drinks, particularly their tequila selection (the waitress reminded me multiple times they were a tequila bar).  It's a shame that they don't put nearly as much effort into the food.  But when your bar area is about the same size as your dining room, go figure.

We started with an order of guacamole with housemade chips, the red snapper ceviche, and the queso fundo with chorizo.  First off, the guac is hideously expensive ($9 or upwards for a relatively small dish).  The design-your-own format is creative, but open to some pretty expensive and awful combinations (bleu cheese and crab?  really?)  The ceviche was messy and clunky to eat; the fish was still in really large chunks, so it was awkward when I tried to bring some over to my plate and didn't expect to be reaping such a large piece of fish.  The queso fundo was good, but kind of messy to eat as well.  Also, I didn't realize the chorizo was served ground; I would have preferred small cubed chunks or bigger pieces.

For dinner, I ordered the steak tacos, which looked nice but like the other dishes, was poorly executed.  There was simply too much meat on the small corn tortillas, and I ended up dripping steak juice all over my hands while I tried to eat the tacos.  He got the deconstructed short rib tamale, which looked and tasted way better than my high-end tacos.  Served as a fork-and-knife dish, it was also less messy and awkward to eat and enjoy

Overall, I thought the food was just ok.  Everything tasted pretty good, but there needs to be more thought put into how the dishes are going to be eaten, not just how they look or taste.  Not even my margarita, which was really damn delicious, could save this dinner or my chances of returning any time soon.

1) Place is empty - Yeah, both times I went it wasn't jammed. Attribute this to the location. I consider a place that serves great food and good prices to be a positive, not a negative.

2) Staff - Every time I have gone here I have been service by the owner (I think). Either way he is the nicest guy ever and had great suggestions. I've ordered an African crepe both times for the main course and I am in love with them.

3) Decor - It is pretty simple. I go to Del Frisco's or Barclay Prime and expect nice furnishings. When I am paying $6-10 bucks for a crepe I am happy sitting on an orange crate. The furniture is nice and clean so no issues. 

I've been to Creperie Beau Monde & L'Etage a couple times and both are really good. I think comparing that place to this is both unfair and incorrect.

Oh I'm alarmed! Believe me.

Listen, I know it happens every year. Seasons. But come on. 

What in the Hell have I been doing? I've only made one visit to Italiano's this year? Euuugh, I disgust me... Italiano's will only be open for only about 2 more weeks and then no more perfect, perfect water ice til Summer 2015.

It's perfect though, their water ice is. That's what I'm tellin you. I know I'm gonna sound like a loon, but their's is a seriously precise consistency of icy slush.

Italiano's lemon water ice. Tis the best in the land! It's ever so refreshingly lemony.

a recent order of two farmhouse burgers were pretty good.  one was overcooked, the other was right on.  both came with a pile of well cooked fries. altogether it was too much to finish. i believe that the menu price was $13.00; might have been $15.00. either way, its a good price for a lot of food. there were several other menu items that were appealing.

The food at the back is good but limited to mostly vegan food. No meats which makes me sad because I love eating organic healthy foods but am not vegan so it left me wanting more. The selection of herbs and natural products makes me very happy. They carry a large amount of vitamins and natural products that you can usually only find online. It's more expensive here than shopping online but I don't have to wait a week to get it.

Then there are times when you want to stuff your face with big tasty rolls.  That is what Makiman is for. 

Went on Saturday night with a groupon in hand and reservations for 8pm.  I'm not sure that we really needed those reservations, but I'm working towards that big $10 opentable giftcard (after a mere 6 years, I'm about 2/3 of the way there!).  I started with some miso soup and then the spicy tuna tartar.  The tuna tartar was better the last time I dined at Makiman. It wasn't as spicy this time around and I bit into something hard.  I had a moment of omg-what-the-fuck-was-that-some-sort-of-fish-gristle!?!?!?! panic and then realized it was just  a chunk of tempura.  Weird.  Hard chunks do not belong in tuna tartar and I hit 2 of them. Also my plate had a big chip in it.  Ghetto.  Throw out your chipped plates. I sampled my boyfriend's rock shrimp tempura.  It was good but not the best I've had (Zento's is much better).

I ordered two rolls.  The raw viking roll was my favorite.  It was fresh and tasty.  I also had the yellow stallion which was pretty good.  The specialty rolls are HUGE. I was stuffed after dinner. 

Our server was great and the food came out very quickly. I still can't decide if their motto ""Do you like it raw?"" is a double entendre ode to ODB or an unintentionally funny, innocently fobby question. Either way it's pretty amusing.  The sushi at Makiman isn't bad, just not as high quality as some other places.  I'd maybe return with another groupon deal, but would not seek it out as a sushi destination.",2012-01-08 16:21:25,"{'food': ['sashimi', 'tuna tartar', 'rock shrimp tempura', 'raw viking roll', 'yellow stallion roll'], 'drink': []}"

They are covered in a mixture of diced veggies, sour cream, melted cheese, pulled pork and copious amounts of citrus/lime juice. 
The Mac and cheese is also unreal. Mac and cheese is not a dish that I typically order out (because I have my own recipe), but this is the exception. I love it. 

The tap selection is stacked, and they are constantly rotating new and excellent craft beers from all over the place. The prices are very reasonable for craft beers in old city, and they also have a happy hour! During the happy hour, they offer a frozen mint julep for 5 bucks. I grew up in Cincinnati, and spent lots of time watching horse racing and drinking mint juleps, but have never had a frozen rendition until Khyber Pass.

They could have just had an ""off"" Saturday night but it was in fact, extremely off then. It's not a new business from what I can tell so unless the manager or chef walked out, I'm not sure what the reasons were for the poor service...

I went in with my parents on a Saturday night and we were promptly seated after our 8 pm reservation but had to ask the waiter to uncork the wine. He never told us what the specials were; I had to ask him. We waited for 15-20 minutes before the server came back to take our order. We ordered the artichoke heart appetizer and jumbo lump crabmeat appetizer. 30-40 minutes later after asking our server where the appetizers were, the artichokes and a calamari dish appeared. The server thought we wanted the calamari instead of the crabmeat appetizer but who could blame him? We could barely hear ourselves think let alone talk in the restaurant. We were so hungry though we didn't even attempt to send it back. There was no spectacular presentation with the appetizers, it was almost like they had just thrown it on the plate from a big pot in the kitchen. I couldn't really blame him though - the place was so loud with people talking we could barely hear ourselves. Not only did the appetizers take 40 minutes to get to our table, the artichokes were way too salty and the calamari was so spicy it masked the flavors of the dish. 

After the appetizers, we sat around for 30+ more minutes while waiting for our entrees. I'm usually pretty patient but I was so hungry I had eaten the entire basket of bread and was about to start knawing my arm off. The server said he would go check with the kitchen and told us ""every meal is prepared to order""...yes as most restaurants do. I'm not a big fan of leaving a restaurant in the middle of dinner service but no tables around us had received their entrees either so I knew we would be waiting some time. We asked for the server to speak to the manager. The man who originally poured us water and whom I had to ask what the specials were came over and asked us if everything was ok. I'm guessing he was not in fact the manager because he was not very professional. We said we just wanted the check and to leave and he said he would go check with the kitchen. He came back up and all he said was ""The kitchen said it's fine."" Yes... I was just as confused as you are. 

So overall, very disappointing. I usually give places a second chance and having been a server and bartender myself, I would never blame the waitstaff or make them feel at fault but there is a missing link in this chain. I was not impressed with the atmosphere, food, or service, especially at prices like that.

Went there recently with a 3 and a 4- year old in tow. Our waiter Eric, couldn't have been better! Aside from being friendly, informative & very competent, he was a master with the kiddos. He put their food orders in right away, before we even had a chance to request it. He brought them the coloring menus promptly, and when he realized they were out of crayons, he gave one of the kids his own pen. He also spent time discussing video game characters with the 4-year-old, even pulling out his phone to try to determine the name of a particular character. Awesome! Thanks, Eric!

I will start with the best and work my way down.  The dessert we ordered was not on the menu.  My boyfriend asked the waiter for his recommendation and he said the pastry chef is actually whipping up a new concoction that he personally loves but you have to like fruity things to be a fan.  He described a citrus and rum infused pound cake creation with ice cream and caramel and peaches.  I love pound cake so I was immediately a fan.  He brought out an amazing toasted pound cake which alone was so delicious but then throw in the ice cream, caramel drizzle, and warm sliced peaches and it was just heavenly!  The best part of the dinner for sure.

The second best was my one martini.  The first one I ordered was the Jim Bean Peachy Keen and it was a little too whiskified for my liking.  The second drink I selected was the Pear Martini which I forget the full name of but it was AMAZING! However if you do not like cinnamon then this drink is not for you.  The pear taste was balanced so perfectly with the cinnamon and it was just wow! 

Next up is the appetizer, we picked the deviled eggs based on a yelp review and it was a great choice!  They were delicious and hit the spot.  Nothing crazy about them...just right.

Finally, the main course.  I picked the Pistachio crusted Til,apia and it just did not tickle my fancy.  The crust was really good but the sauce they use is a little too bitter.  I think a creamy sauce would have been a better fit.  I only ate a few bites and got the rest to go.   The meal is paired with rice and spinach which were ok but again nothing crazy exciting to shout down the streets about.

Recommendation is I would say go, go, go, and I would even definitely come back again  to try something else.  My boyfriend had the Chicken and Waffles and while I do not eat chicken I did try the waffle with gravy and it was so freaking good.

I stopped by on a walk with my dog and bf. They let me bring the dog in- massive props. The space is really lovely. It's got great high ceilings, lots of sitting room, (but all tables and chairs like a cafeteria, no cushy seating) They are open late, which is nice, but still, it's just not quite what I'm looking for. If I leave my house and walk south instead of north, I end up at Chapterhouse, and while GK is certainly nice, I also need my beverage to be on par with the aesthetics of the place, and at least at my first visit, it was not. It burnt my mouth and was 3/4 foam and 1/4 espresso and not a latte in any form of the word. 

I'm sure we'll try it again and at that point, I'll give it a second chance and second review, but for right now it would be my last choice for a coffee fix. Sorry guys.",2010-11-24 15:30:49,"{'food': ['latte'], 'drink': ['soy cappucino']}"

I tried the special they had on the sign outside--turkey wrap, fries, & salad. It was really good. The salad was a Caesar salad and it was hugeeeee, the turkey was fresh--it had turkey, bacon, lettuce, and shredded cheese in a plain tortilla, and the fries were crisp. It would've been better if it was a little warm though. My wife had a  burger with fries again and enjoyed it. We also got mozzarella sticks that were crisp with good marina.

The worst thing about our visit was that our waitress brought our mozzarella sticks, but didn't bring plates or utensils...

I'm sure you can see from other reviews, but be prepared for SPICY food. They will adjust the level of spice if you ask though, so don't be shy to ask if you can't handle high heat.

Spicy Crispy Cucumber (5/5) - I order this every time I come here. The cucumbers are soaked in chili oil, so there is heat, but the freshness of the cucumbers takes away from the spiciness

Pork Belly w/ Sweet Garlic Chili Oil Sauce (4/5) - The pork belly is (I think?) boiled, so don't expect it to be crispy like other pork belly dishes. This is one of my favorite appetizers. The garlic adds a nice flavor to this dish.

Wontons in Chili Oil (3.5/5) - I really like the actual wonton itself, but these soak up a little too much chili oil for me

Dan Dan Noodle (4.5/5) - This dish is a staple of Han Dynasty. I love it so much that after I moved away from Philadelphia, I learned how to make it myself. The only reason I'm giving it a 4.5 instead of a 5 is that sometimes, it comes out kind of watery. A must have if you come to Han Dynasty.

Cold Sesame Noodle (3.5/5) - These noodles are a nice substitute for the Dan Dan noodles if you don't have a high heat tolerance. They are also a nice side dish to have so not EVERYTHING you eat is spicy. It is a little too sesame-y for me though.

Braised Beef Noodle Soup (4/5) - One of my favorite noodle dishes. The broth is nice and warm, and they are generous with the meat. This is also a nice, non-spicy dish to enjoy.

Spicy Beef Noodle Soup (3/5) - This is a spicy version of the dish before. For some reason, there is something about the chili oil which I don't enjoy much. I don't like the way it coats my tongue when I am drinking the soup.

Dry Pepper Chicken/Fish (4/5) - I usually get this dish when I come here too. The level of fried is nice, and it is a pleasant level of heat. 

Cumin Lamb (3.5/5) - Usually I enjoy cumin in my food, but this is a little too cumin-y for me. My other friends seem to really enjoy this dish though. Regardless, it is a pretty tasty dish, just a strong for my taste.

Crispy Rice Chicken/Fish (4/5) - This dish is a favorite of my friends who can't handle spicy food. There is no heat, and the flavors are nice, with a assortment of mushrooms and bamboos shoots.

I think its time I grow a ponytail, wear dark Raybans, put on a black turtleneck, and sit around with my Macbook writing my next screenplay. 

Another thing I really love and this holds especially true for espresso drinkers is the need for water when drinking a good strong espresso. This is where La Colombe really shines, they have warm, cold, and amazingly Sparkling water for free. So that I can sip and enjoy every bit of the espresso because I have water to refresh my palate.

Small place, close tables, decorated from about 1975, but looked very clean. Service pretty good. My partner ordered the special of the night Chicken Piccata ($20) and was a 6 out of 10. OK, but nothing special.  We were in the mood for garlic and got our fix with the excellent broccoli AND broccoli rabe sides (10 out of 10)  I got the mussels and spag. which I would rate a 7 out of 10. The mussels were tender, but a little bit on the fishy side, and there were a LOT of them - yikes! I would have rather had a smaller amt. of them but fresher. Spag. was fresh and cooked well and had  juicy garlicky broth. Rolls were outstanding which you always expect in South Philly. We didn't drink cocktails, but did have fresh brewed iced tea which was about as good as iced tea gets. We weren't offered a refill though which was a little disappointing. But they had given us water so we were OK. I think Ralph's is resting on their laurels.

I expected a whole different type of place.  I thought that the restaurant would have more of a romantic feeling, sadly it was lacking.  The decor was outdated but gave it character.

I started off with the crab soup and it was eh.   I had better, I actually think trader joe's crab corn soup had more flavor.  If you are looking for great seafood soup, go to Philips seafood.  Now that is what I call a delicious soup.  

I opted for crab cakes for my entree and they were just OK.  I personally felt like there was too much filler in them.

The atmosphere and decor is very comfortable and laid back, with a menu that makes you feel like you're downtown. Their menu is a mix of comfort food with a dash of elegance. 

When they first opened I loved going there, especially for their blue duck fries. The past few times, the food has been hit or miss. The last time I went, I ordered the fried chicken and it was burnt to a black crisp. I actually ate a piece or two thinking that was the way it was supposed to be but it was clearly burnt after all.

When I approached the manager, I let him know that I was a big fan of the restaurant but my chicken was black, not too get a refund but just to let him know what happened. I was met with a, ""Ok thanks"" and then I left, feeling like an idiot. I'm never one to complain but I really like the place so I was more so giving them a heads up.

Zorba's is on the small side, so I would recommend calling ahead for a reservation if possible.  We called at 8:30 last night, and after some back and forth in Greek between the person who answered the phone and someone else, they decided that we could be seated at 9:30.  

Since we had never dined at Zorba's before, we decided to go all out and try the cold appetizer tray and the Charcoal Platter for two.  We also got a small Greek salad (hey, we were hungry!).  Everything was delicious.  The salad was fresh, crispy, and refreshing.  The appetizer plate had two types of hummus, tzatziki, moussaka, and a few other dips with lightly toasted pita.  The platter was humongous, and was piled high with chicken, pork, lamb, gyro meat, a spinach patty, rice, and veggies.  I didn't try a single thing that I didn't love, and my other half was in a meat-lovers heaven.  

The only slight downside is that the service was a little on the slow side at the end of our meal.  Our food came out extremely quickly, but we did have to wait a little bit to hail down the bill.  Not a problem, and everyone was very friendly.  Prices are very reasonable, our bill amounted to around $45 for all of that food!

I went in Kermit's for the first time today. I asked the woman at the counter what their popular items were. I like to ask the people that work at food establishments what's really good because 1.) they usually have so much enthusiasm about it and I think that's awesome and they could sell me anything at that point and 2.) they're getting the feedback everyday and seeing what people are going crazy for. Under her breath the woman mumbled, ""the pizza is good, our pop-somethings are good...people like the ice cream sandwiches"". No enthusiasm and barely audible. 

I'm looking at the pizza, the pop whatevers, the little desserts and I'm like, do I really want to spend money on this right now??

However, we had to go up and ask for menus after being seated for a few minutes, which was a little annoying.  After that, the service was pretty good. The waitress was friendly and attentive, and accommodating of our large group.

The sushi is decent and the prices are reasonable, considering the location in Center City.  I had a miso soup, yellowtail scallion roll and the caterpillar roll.  The fish was fresh and was presented nicely.  I especially enjoyed the caterpillar roll because it wasn't overly stuffed with ingredients but still had a nice combination of flavors.  I also sampled a friend's Vegetarian Bi Bim Bop which I also enjoyed.  It's a large platter with a nice mix of ingredients and flavors.  It's great if you have a big appetite. 

We did not take advantage of the BYO this time but its definitely a plus when visiting this restaurant.  Overall, Makiman is average compared with other sushi restaurants in the city.

We were completely overdue for a nice date night out that didn't consist of red box movies and homecooked meals (although delicious!).  We decided we needed to shower, put on nice clothes, and step out into town.

So I tried to make reservations via opentable.  The next 3 weeks for a Friday/Saturday were completely booked.  WHAT?! So we put our sweatpants back on and got pizza instead after I booked a table for 4 weeks later.

One night, we were out with friends and we were discussing a good place to go for dinner without a prior reservation.  Farm and Fisherman just happened to have a table available for a Saturday night! So we booked it, and we're so glad we did.  

I still dream about that beet steak, which can be found on their menu regularly (I think). But their menu changes often, so telling you what we ate seems silly but everything was saliva-inducing amazing.

Judy was our server and she was fantastic.  She was so personable and sweet without being overbearing.  Timing on the food service was impeccable, and our wine and water glasses were never empty (well, until we ran out of wine).   The restaurant itself felt like you were eating in someone's home.  Tables were close, and this place is better for couples or smaller groups of 4 or less.  I saw patrons enter and greeted with hugs from the servers.  WHAT?  

There is a reason why the dining room is fully reserved all the time.  People have standing reservations and come regularly.  Explains the hugs and lots of friendly banter between customers and servers.  Well... so we decided to keep our original reservation , which is coming up! Judy noted it, so hopefully I'll get a hug next week.
