I called twenty minutes before we were to eat to see if they could accommodate a party of eight. They said no problem, and would be awaiting our arrival.

We did not encounter the poor service as did the last reviewer who dined there during the snow storm in February 2010. The price for the food was about right; it came to at little over $80 (not including tip) for two people for three courses. Our bill was higher because we selected two of the higher priced entrees.  We had three drinks with our meal, which were on the steep side in terms of price - $30 total. This pushed our dinner cost to $110 before taxes and tip. They also offer a fixed three course menu for $35 per person. You could easily dine for two without alcohol for around $60 - $70, before taxes and tip. 

What detracts from Phillips is mainly its location. It is located in the Sheraton hotel on North 17th street. There is not any night life around and the food, service & price are not so great as to make it a destination by itself.

I love a restaurant that serves small plates so I can get a taste of what the menu really offers - but that being said, you can quickly over-order, so mind your plates! 

Fat Ham also serves up one of my newest favorite salad : the mustard greens.  Try and fight me for it if we order it together.  I will finish every bite.  The hot mustard dressing complements the sharp bitter greens perfectly.  Scrumptious.    After that make sure you order a couple oyster sliders (perfectly fried) and shrimp and grits (order more than one!).  Those are your musts!  Don't argue with me!

The hot chicken, however, is not for the faint of heart.  It will kick you right in the pants and whoa. Hot damn... it might even leave you tearing up.

Amazing selection of bourbons and whiskeys (very intimidating) and reasonable wines by the glass.

EDIT: the owner (Smiley!) had emergency open-heart surgery, hence the temporary closing. Those of you who are griping about the closure, have a heart (hehe)!

And THANK GOODNESS because this place is - no exaggeration - my #1 spot for lunch and/or dinner. I absolutely LOVE Smiley's. I have lived (and eaten) all over the world, from Amsterdam to Colorado, from Nicaragua to Italy, from Hawaii to London and everywhere in between, and this place is hands down the best Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food I have ever had. The ingredients are always fresh (Beautiful tomatoes! Crispy greens! Exquisite hummus!) and extremely flavorful. The owners are the friendliest people and they recognize their regulars (like me, lol). I don't think I'm the most memorable person but, even if I haven't visited in a while (which is very rare, because I'm addicted to the beef shawarma and struggle to not grab a meal here every single day), they know who I am. They really know how to make a girl feel special! :-)

Everything is homemade with love that you can taste. The falafel is rich and exploding with flavor, the hummus is even better than my mom's (sorry Mom, love you!), and don't even get me started on the beef! Perfectly spiced and cooked on a rotating spit... my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The prices are unbelievably reasonable and the portions are very generous.

In terms of the drinks Aldine had three different kind, one with cucumber, one w/apple and one that was like an orange/champagne mix. While all of the drinks were quite delicious and inexpensive ($5), it would have been nicer if they added less ice into the mixture. As for the appetizers, we tried their corn and truffle custard, smoked trout tartine and fresh sausage, in addition to a few of the sips appetizers (including a beet dish, a chicken liver mouse dish and a buffalo potato dish). Of all of these, I was not the biggest fan of the buffalo potato, as it tasted liked fried potatoes smothered in buffalo chicken sauce...exactly like how you imagine it, but that was it. The fresh sausage was really quite remarkable, primarily due to the very tangy, spicy sauce that accompanied each of the freshly made sausage chunks. The trout tartine was ok, but for $10 plus on a little dish, I felt rather disappointed.

What really sells this place is the ambiance, as it is situated on the second floor in the middle of center city and the view and overall classy/traditional vibe is really wonderful.

At the end of the day, the four of us spent $100 on 4 appetizers and 2 rounds of drinks during sips day, which is kinda pricy and we all left for meal #2-3, but for the taste, this place certainly has you covered.

Chalkboard menus adorn the walls with daily specials. Diner glass domes of sweets line the counter along with refreshed coffee cups and chatting locals. 

I love the laid back atmosphere of Honey's. The hostess was friendly and offered menus for kiddos and sat us right away. Our server was as laid back as can be but friendly.

We ordered the well known potato latkes with sour cream. These are fantastic and a must order. Crispy on the outside, squishy potato mash on the inside. My 8 year old devoured his immediately.

La Columbe coffee served here. A++ for that!

Kids had the egg sandwich on brioche bun & single pancake filled with chocolate. Pancakes are huge so for kiddos one is more than enough. My kids polished their plates... Thumbs up from the mini peeps.

My husband had the French toast special which was caramelized coconut & banana. Holy moly.. Yum! Gooey and sweet.

I had the Toad In Hole which was by far my favorite. Hollandaise soaked Challah bread with a poached egg in the center topped with melted Jack cheese and truffle oil. Served with a side of spicy arugula with a tart lemon vinaigrette. To die for. The flavors were amazing together and the portion was just enough.

The food is good, but it takes a lot to blow me away with breakfast food. Most of your standard fare breakfast options with a more organic twist.  It also leans towards the more expensive end of things. 

Service has been hit or miss in some past experiences. Twice I had a server who looked like he literally rolled out of bed and showed up.  I understand it's a hip spot, but it just came off as unprofessional.

If you and/or your companion are as entertaining as me and/or tinasaurus you might just walk a block or two too far north. Eeks. 

This place is the one with the giant neon arrow enclosing the word ""BAR"" outside. 

The bar is long with plenty of seats and intermittent bar out-pouchings. These bar tentacles allow you to sit at the bar but also face your companion. Interesting and pivotal innovation. 

On this particular occasion we elected to be conventional and sat at the regular bar. We were provided menus. I had to ask specifically for a happy hour menu to receive one, somewhat manipulative imo. 

The happy hour prices are good. I believe $7 gets you the one happy hour cocktail they're offering. For my visit it was a brandy beverage. Dark liquors scream subsequent nausea to me so I usually pass. Luckily there were about 4 $4 beers on the happy hour menu. 

The most appealing choice was the Oktoberfest offering. Unfortunately they had not received the shipment yet. This begs the question of why on God's earth they would put this on the happy hour menu if it was not in their possession. 

Second best option was the nitro. My patience was tested while I waited for that shit to settle. Tinasaurus ordered a cider off the regular menu.  

The growling from the depths of our bowels indicated it was time to order food. (when is it not, tho?) Happy hour menu has some interesting and enticing options. We ultimately went with the hummus with veggies and flatbread (for health reasons) and fries (for emotional reasons). 

So the hummus is served with a black bean/garlic sauce on top, cucumbers, pickled carrots and some other shit including two giant green balls that may either be olives or grapes. I'm going to real here, as hummus' #1 fan, I was very disappointed in this. It just wasn't that good. It didn't taste much like genuine hummus. That black sauce on top was weird. Texture wasn't as smooth as it should be. I guess if you're looking for the real stuff it would be better to head over to dizengoff or zahav.

Fries, on the other hand, spectacular. One of the best I've had in memory. Thin AF, crispy and they didn't get lazy with the seasoning.  Fries accompanied by this delicious garlic creamy white sauce. Tina ate the shit out of it. I chose to alternate between that, ketchup, and sriracha dollops. 

Drink menu on the regular menu has tons of options. For my second beverage I chose this peach blueberry or some other fruit combo beer. Delicious. 

We did have to wait a hot minute for service even though we were legit sitting right in front of the face of the bartender. Bartender was nice though. 

I was also eyeing the mac and cheese some people sitting at the end of one of the bar tentacles ordered.

Instead, my friend suggested going to London Grill in the Fairmount section of the city. He was talking up this amazing burger on an English muffin with..... a fried egg on top. Well, that sold me!

So we headed on over to London Grill, which just won best burger in Philly in the first-ever city wide 'Burger Brawl'. I was worried and excited at the same time. Would it be able to measure up to my standards? Would this be it? Would I finally find the best burger in Philly?

The answer is both yes and no.

Yes, the burger was amazing. I got mine topped with avocado, fried onions and boursin cheese. Cooked perfectly medium: Juicy, moist and delicious - everything I could ever ask for! The toasted English muffin reminded me of a home-grilled burger; no pretentious brioche buns here! (They forgot the fried egg, sadly, but I couldn't complain.)

I can confidently say that this is absolutely one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to in my LIFE.  The experience was unsatisfactory from beginning to end and I can honestly say that I have never been so disrespected in my life as a customer.  We sat upstairs and our waitress (some girl who seemed out of it with short, mousy brown hair and an enormous attitude) was rude to begin with, then proceeded to take 10 minutes to bring our drinks and ended up messing up our order.  My sister and I specifically ordered eggplant parmesan, which the waitress must have repeated back to us 4 times.  She then brought us chicken parmesan, and as she handed it to us she said, ""here's your chicken parmesan"" So of course I said, ""this is chicken? I ordered eggplant, remember?"" and she said ""I'm sorry, you're right, it's eggplant"".  As a trusting customer, I took her at her word and began to eat my food, which was in fact CHICKEN! My sister was upset, but could deal.  I on the other hand am a strict vegetarian and have not eaten meat in over 10 years. Until that night. I was furious at this careless waitress and of course did not eat anything.  We then explained to the girl what she had done and asked politely for her to take the chicken parmesan's off our check.  She rudely told us  that we had to wait for her manager, who was at the store.  We waited for 10 minutes and when we couldn't wait any longer due to the fact that we had somewhere else to be and were already running late because of her mistake, we said ""can you please just fix this and explain to your manager later?"".  At this point, the waitress and another waitress who was standing with her became extremely inappropriate, telling us they won't help us, it's our problem, and leave if we can't wait.  This type of shocking exchange continued until the manager finally showed up a few minutes later.  He was just as rude, telling us ""fine, what do you want me to do, take the chicken parms off your bill? Fine then.""  As he was bombarding us with HIS rudeness, his two waitresses were standing behind him, staring us down and mouthing at my mother and sister and I the word ""b****"" over and over again! Obviously we were completely shocked and when we told him what they were doing, he DENIED that they would do that and said we were out of line for suggesting such a thing! He then proceeded to say to my sister and mother and I, ""ladies, leave this to the men to handle (my father was there as well), you are obviously incapable of dealing"".  There was no getting through to these exceptionally RUDE individuals.  I will write a negative review on every single website I can and I will call the local newspapers, and Better Business Bureau, etc.  If I could give this place negative stars I would.

That said, the other stuff that I've tried here pretty much sucks. The buffalo wings are WEAK and the chicken fingers are overcooked and not juicy at all, contrary to the experience described by another reviewer.

And the customer service is just bad...  it turns out they have a 10% student discount. I only noticed a sign for it after they rang me up and gave my change, but they wouldn't help me out after the fact, even though I had tipped for take-out more than the amount that they would have had to discount. The student discount is only on a tiny sign a few feet away from the register - not something you'd notice before the few seconds it takes to be rung up, unless you were a compulsive sign reader. 

I'll probably come here again because it's super convenient to me and the pizza is OK, but next time, I'm asking for the student discount in advance and NOT tipping.

I went with my bf, his parents, our close friend and her parents and friends to Marrakesh. She chose the restaurant, having been there before, and chose the 8:30pm seating time for our party of 10. The restaurant is located off of South Street on this almost alley-like street, and the moment you walk in you grasp the concept they're trying to throw out at you: a traditional Moroccan-style meal in a setting that's supposed to mimic Moroccan interiors, with loud Middle Eastern style music (that sounded like the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack). Rugs are everywhere, on the floor and wall, and you sit on low couches or cushion stools around round tables. 

The meal is a 7 course prix fixe $35 per person (no a la carte menu), although they do have vegetarian alternatives to the meat dishes. The only menu they hand you is the drinks menu, which ranges from beer to wine to rose water to Coca cola. The menu is as follows:

First course: 3 salads, eggplant, tomato-cucumber, and carrot
Second course: phyllo pastry filled with chicken and egg with powdered sugar and cinnamon on top. Vegetarian alternative is without chicken, just egg.
Third course: Whole chicken, slow-cooked, either mild or spicy (we asked for spicy sauce on the side). Vegetarians get a lentil dish.
Fourth course: Either honey lamb or beef shish kebabs, we asked for both. Vegetarians have a spinach-filled rolled pastry.
Fifth course: Couscous topped with chicken, raisins, and vegetables. No chicken for vegetarians.
Sixth course: Fresh fruit bowl
Seventh course: mint tea and baklava.

The meal was awful from the start. They sat us all the way at the top floor, in the back - we're pretty sure they continuously forgot about us throughout the meal. Our waiter looked like he was in high school, and it took him 15 minutes to get our drinks (only 4 people ordered anything); in the mean time, the music was so obnoxiously loud we could barely talk to one another, let alone the people next to us, and the air conditioning was so high that I was shivering - and I was wearing a sweater! - and even after asking them to turn it down, it was STILL cold.

Considering that its a prix fixe menu, you would expect the food to come out quickly, but we waited about 45 minutes for the first course, which isn't even cooked! Our waiter was not attentive in general, and each course took far too long to come out (he also took forever to realize we were done with each dish). The food overall was not good - edible, but where were the spices? The FLAVOR?! My bf said the lamb was good, but otherwise we were all very disappointed in the dishes. And there was waaaay too much food, we felt bad towards the end because of all the wasted food since we could barely have more than a bite of the later courses. The fruit plate mostly went into people's purses. I was most disappointed by the baklava, which was truly awful just phyllo pastry and honey WHERE WERE THE NUTS?! I'm Greek, I love baklava and this was awful. 

Perhaps the worst part of the evening, after suffering through awful service, bad food and too much of it, obnoxious atmosphere (which includes a belly dancer going around to each table), the waiter brings the bill and tells us AT THAT MOMENT that they take cash or check but NOT credit cards. They didn't tell us when we made the reservations, they didn't tell us at the beginning of the meal to allow us to run to a bank and get money, they had the audacity to tell us right at the end. I thought he was joking, but no. We managed to pool enough cash together, but the entire experience was not worth it and I will NEVER go back there.

My entree was delicious. The halibut was cooked perfectly and had nice vegetable compliments. My date's Amish chicken almost melted in my mouth and I was jealous I didn't get to eat more of his dish! 

The restaurant comped us a free cheesecake dessert with panna cotta and that was absolutely exquisite. The tart berries truly made that dessert one of the best I've had in a long time. The pumpkin bread pudding was different than what I'm accustomed to and not as moist as I would have hoped for seeing as bread pudding is my favorite dessert. 

Our waitress also left something to be desired as she was a bit clumsy, bumping into our table on occasion and knocking my purse off the chair. She also forgot the specials of the evening and mispronounced a few dishes which surprised me considering the caliber of restaurant. 

I really appreciated the attention of some of the other waiters and the chef asking how we enjoyed everything and wishing me a happy anniversary. I'm an attention whore so the free dessert and attention of the restaurant staff are what bumps Square 1682 from 3 to 4 stars for me.

I had been there for dinner once before and adored it, but I always wanted to return for brunch, since I heard excellent things about Kanella's brunch. My brunch experience this morning solidified Kanella's place in my heart forever. It is probably in my top 5 favorite restaurants in all of Philadelphia, since the dishes here have been consistently fresh and flavorful. The food manages to be rich, complex, and filling yet surprisingly light. 

I had family visiting from out of town, and I wanted to take my family to somewhere unique instead of a typical brunch spot with all the predictable items. Kanella's brunch menu is creative, and integrates some lunch and dinner items with more traditional breakfast mainstays like fried eggs. To start, we got freshly pressed coffee and the dips of the day. The dips impressed right off the bat. The baba ganoush and hummus were perfectly garlicky and lemony. Our favorite was a blend of carrots, feta, and some other delicious ingredients I really wish I could remember (facepalm). The grape leaves on the Kanella platter were among the best I've ever had. The rice was well-textured, and the grape leaves avoided being overly oily and mushy, a grape leaf pitfall I've experienced in the past. My dad had the most breakfast-y item out of all of us, which was the stewed tomato and onion shakshouka served with eggs and crispy bread. He enjoyed it greatly and described it as a fresh variation on huevos rancheros. The haloumi here is the best I've ever had. 

I was very happy in my decision to take an out-of-towner here, and I will keep it in mind  when I need to impress my next Philly visitor!

$30 vegetarian and $35 meat, and the portions are substantial!

Bread w/ dip (lentil this time), really delicious dip! There was a side of picked vegetables that were pretty good too..but I only like olives (personal preference though)

It was 2 of us (1 meat and 1 veg meze):
4 dishes for appetizer -- duck heart, boar sausage, grape leaf wrap with sauce, falafel, my favorite were the falafel (it was pink on the inside! maybe beets?) and the grape leaf. My boyfriend said the duck heart was really delicious, and the boar too. I'm particular about meats and did not try those.

7 main dishes - pork dish, bean dish, sea food (some sort of squid), chicken, spinach pastry, stuffed tomato, and beets. I LOVED the bean and the spinach pastry. Definitely delicious. The great thing was that all dishes had its own unique taste, no taste really repeated (except for the yogurt sauce that accompanied some). 

By the end I was super stuffed, but the desserts sounded delicious!

Desserts aren't included in the meze, but at $5 a pop, they're a bargain!
Had their home made baklava and some sort of custard/filo/orange thing. I loved both! So delicious. Their coffee was good too.

I will DEFINITELY be coming back! Come hungry because the portions could have fed 4 of us well. Reservation would be good for the Sunday meze, as when we went there was only 1 free table. The location is very small.

I would consider myself somewhat of a veteran when it comes to Reading Terminal but in regards to getting some game meats, fish or cuts that I wouldnt be able to get elsewhere, it's usually a one stop shop for me and I am off to the kitchen.

Today was a rare day that I decided to try Beck's.  I was there with a friend who said he read good things.

This is right up there with the best of Nola, and maybe the best I have ever had... no joke!

I originally went for a cup of the Crab, Shrimp, Crawfish Etouffe and my freinds tried the chicken and sausage gumbo.  Etouffe was awesome and I sampled their Gumbo, unreal as well.  I am almost depressed that I tried this because I always thought I made a pretty mean batch of gumbo and now I have to know this place exists and it is making me rethink my entire dark chocolate roux approach.  

The woman at the counter heard us talking and said that we really need to try the gator gumbo, gave us a sample and as I am typing, I am eating the cup I brought home with me.  Great spice level, smoky flavor...  Again, rethinking my entire approach.  I tried getting some info out of her as to what ingredients they make their roux with, to no avail.

For starters he had peppers and mozzarella which was just that, a bunch of roasted pepper slices emptied out of a can or jar with these strange round hard, cold cheese balls (no, they were not bocconchini, no, no, no.)  I ordered calamari.  It was a bowl of prepared frozen calamari in a reddish brown liquid of ingredients unknown.  Absolutely revolting.  The main courses were lasagna and chicken parmigiana.  The chicken was a cutlet breaded and fried sometime long ago (days ago, at least) before they assembled it with tasteless cheese.  The lasagna was about six inches high and had a meat filling that was rancid.  We didn't want to spoil our day in Philadelphia so we said nothing to the staff.  Besides, the food was so disgusting that they had to know.  My partner, referring to a Kitchen Nightmare show where an Italian restaurant in California was so atrocious that they fired the chef, said that Ralph's must have hired him and given him control of their kitchen.  Oh, the only reason I have given one star is that Yelp doesn't give the no-star option.

Pros:
-Service was good.
-They seated us on time.
-Server was informative and not too overbearing (but he did seem to take it personally when it was obvious we didn't like our food).
-Nice size portions (we went for restaurant week and it was a good amount of food for the $35).

Cons:
-Owner and menu have changed and that means NO MORE SOPA AZTECA!! That's the ONLY reason I wanted to go there! Huge disappointment. For some reason I was confusing the tortilla soup with Sopa Azteca. Well, that was dumb of me!
-The food just fell short. We ordered the 4 cheese empanadas and they were just so heavily fried, seemed almost triple fried. I know that many empanadas are fried but these were just so heavy and well, I couldn't finish them.
-My friend and I shared the adobo shrimp and pollo frito. The server was really pushing the pollo. It wasn't anything spectacular, trust! 'm glad that I didn't pay full price for that because $30 for a mediocre fried chicken would just be frustrating. 
-Dessert. Well by the time we ordered, one of the choices was removed because ""something happened in the kitchen."" We got the doughnuts and the flan. The flan stood out, it was good. Again, the doughnuts seemed like they were quadruple fried or something.

Their noodles dishes are all great, but these two are our favorites.  They never overcook their noodles, so the fried noodle dishes arent soggy.  The chow kueh teow is spicy and a little heavier, while the penang pad thai (tastes nothing like pad thai at a thai restaurat btw), is lighter which is why we like the balance.  

Their mango chicken is also great, the sauce is soo good, while at other places the sauce tastes like glamourized ketchup.  We also recommend the sauteed water convulus which has lots of garlic!

My boyfriend, his brother and I tried out In Riva last night. As a precursor, the restaurant was not terribly busy, so the issues we had were not a result of an overtaxed staff or kitchen.  If our first mistake was choosing In Riva to have dinner, our second mistake was deciding to sit at the bar.  We sat down at the bar and waited, and waited, and waited until the bartender finally acknowledged out presence with a half-hearted apology about making us wait.  All three of us ordered both appetizers and entrees.  While it was obvious that were were all dining together, the kitchen decided that we should all get our food at different times.  My boyfriend ordered the pea soup, which came out first.  About five minutes later his brother's octopus arrived, and yet another five minutes later my meatballs finally arrived.  My boyfriend and his brother were both finished with their appetizers before mine arrived at the bar.  This ritual of staggering dishes and service was repeated when our entrees came out - again my boyfriend's ravioli arrived first, his brother's rigatoni followed several minutes later and my pizza arrived last and when the pasta's were nearly completely consumed.  This kind of service is unacceptable as it makes the dining experience awkward for all the members of the party.  However, no one at In Riva found this to be at all problematic, and it seemed to par for the course.  

The food in and of itself was good, however, it was nothing extraordinary and was WAY overpriced.  While the prices themselves were not terrible, the portions for the appetizers and the entrees were small ($10 for three meatballs and $12 for three vegetable ravioli?!?!)

Lastly, the service from the bartender was the worst service I have had in a  long time.  Not only were we sitting at the bar for a while before she greeted us or took even a drink order, she also specialized in disappearing from the bar for long stretches of time or alternately forgot that she was working and spent her time socializing with a friend of hers rather than taking care of customers.  Her disappearing act occurred at all times when our food arrived, which relieved her of her burden of making sure our food arrived and whether we needed anything.  Further, after we finished, we again waited, and waited, and waited for the check.  The bartender was completely out of the restaurant chatting with the same friend that took all her attention while she was at the bar.  Even after she came back from her adventure with her friend, we had to ask for the check at least twice before it was provided.  It was clear that the last thing that the bartender wanted to do was her job.  

Bottom line, there are many pizza/pasta restaurants in this city that will be getting my business from here on out, and I recommend that others do the same.",2013-09-04 20:25:07,"{'food': ['pea soup', 'rigatoni', 'pizza'], 'drink': []}"

Their other breads [naan, kulcha, etc] were good and to standards you'd expect from a good Indian restaurant. But that goddamn Bhature, I'll have that all day.

Let me first say that it's very nice inside, feels upscale and is definitely a nice place to take someone out on a date. They even play Bollywood flicks on the TV there, great distraction if the date starts talking about the Kardashians or her ex, so just lose yourself in the food and 100 people dancing on the screen.

Opened up with the Pakoda, and having been craving it since I last been to Zaika, it hit the spot. A plate of it is perfect for four, a bit overwhelming for two. Since I'm an eternal fatass, I polished it off, but it didn't leave much room for the dinner...

WHICH WAS INCREDIBLE. It was the Paneer Bhurji, and it will go down as one of the most tasty items I've ever had at any Indian joint. The waitress asked what level of hot I wanted it at, and I foolishly said 10 at first, but quickly revised it to a 7 when I saw her next. The lady friend insisted a 5 was intolerable last time she ate here, so I moved the heat index accordingly from my understanding of her tolerance.

Good move, the curry made me sweat, but didn't break me. BEAST MODE MOTHERFUCKERS. The great thing about food from this region is how exotic it is in comparison to the foods we eat here everyday, so it's a real treat when they take so much care in its preparation and the outcome is as bangin' as my dinner was.

The place is entirely vegetarian, so the dish consisted of grated cheese, onions, and bell pepper with their special dash of spices in a curry. Wholly unexpected was the awesome dish placed in front of me, and staring down a dish of rice [it's included] and a whole basket of nom-tastic Indian breads. Having stuffed myself on the Pakoda, I had to force myself to eat the spicy dish until my stomach called it quits. Not sure if it was from the peppery goodness or just telling me that one man should not consume more than a couple pounds of food in a single sitting.

The meal was placed on top of fresh spring mix. Normally served with yogurt but he knew not to include it. For meat eaters they had plenty of options to go along with this as well, lamb, chicken, and beef.

So good. 4 course meal (plus bread) for $35 each, plus tax and tip. If I had to do it again, I'd choose the Tarte de Legumes, the Saumon, and the Tart Tatin. Also, good-sized portions on everything! Not tiny little fancy portions.

FOOD:
--Delicious little warm rolls, served with an awesome pesto.

--First course is a ""creamy truffle wild mushroom soup""...those of us who got it were delighted. It was delicious if not a little weird-looking...Due to allergies, one in our party got a split pea and ham soup and the other a tomato red pepper bisque. Kudos to them for having substitutions (the waiter explained it's their vegetarian option as the mushroom one is no longer vegetarian), and both enjoyed their soups, but I personally didn't really like either of them.

--Appetizer (8 options): We had the Calamars, the Tarte de Legumes, the Tartare, and the Salade Boston. I had the ""sustainably-harvested calamari stuffed with house-made provençal sausage, fresh herbs, saffron rice, piperade, jus de legumes""...I don't know why but I was expecting your more usual fried calimari, and I'm not a huge fan of fresh seafood, so I didn't particularly care for it. The other two who had it absolutely loved it though. I also tried the ""Tarte de Legumes: roasted eggplant caviar, caramelized onion, and red pepper tart with black olive and goat cheese tapenade, herb sauce, poached Sandy Ridge Farm egg"" and WOW was it delicious. The runny yolk, the tapenade was delicious, and the tart was a little mini cookie-but-not-a-cookie kind of phylo dough thing, a nice accompaniment, as was the bit of greens it was served with. The ""Tartare: fresh Scottish salmon, mango, basil, capers, black olives, cornichons, tomato, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and wonton crisps"" was apparently good, but was being eaten by a tartare conoisseur (6/10 on her scale). She said ""It had bigger chunks of salmon than a standard tartare, which makes it a little fishier tasting."" The salad (""Boston bibb lettuce with crumbled gorgonzola cheese, apple, walnut pralines, and walnut vinaigrette"") was well received: a sweet little salad. My only note on the salad is that it's not a real leafy salad. A couple large leafs of lettuce topped with the other stuff. Fancy salad.

--Main course (8 options): We had the lamb (Agneau), steak (Bavette), scallops (Vol au Vent), and salmon (Saumon). The lamb was oh so tender, literally fall-off-the-bone. Even after removing all the fat/skin, there was plenty of meat for a good-sized entree. The mashed potatoes were also awesome. Carrots were fine, but I didn't notice any turnips. My friend had the steak and loved it, although we noted it was rather lukewarm if not on the cold side. She liked her mashed sweet potatoes and the green beans too. I personally, having tried all the dishes, would say this one was the least special, although still good. I think my favorite was the salmon (""Saumon: pistachio and goat cheese-crusted Scottish salmon filet wrapped in phyllo, carrot purée, creamy Swiss chard, light turmeric and cumin sauce""), although I can't say I tasted the goat cheese. It was just delicious salmon in delicious buttery phyllo. And finally, the scallops (""Vol au Vent: butter-poached scallops in puff pastry with creamy Swiss chard and saffron mussel sauce"") were delicious as well. The sauce they pour over it (table-side) is a sauce made with cream and the juice that the scallops and mussels cook in. It was heavenly. The scallops aren't literally in the puff pastry. It's a puff pastry in the middle (my friend wished the pastry hadn't been soaked as it got soggy, so maybe ask your waiter to pour around it), with 4 good-sized scallops around it and lots of different little vegetables (I want to say I stole some okra off her plate but I could be completely wrong) that get drowned in the delicious sauce. Yum.

--Dessert (4 options): We tried all except the profiteroles: the St. Tropez Cake (""double-layer valhrona chocolate mousse cake with crème anglaise""), the Tart Tatin (""warmed French caramelized apple tart a la mode""), and the Creme Brulee (""caramelized vanilla bean flan""). The cake was our least favorite by far. The bottom is like a spongy cake, and is not texturally-appealing, although the mousse part on top is good. Would not order it again. The Tart Tatin was delicious, although they were out of ice cream, so we got fresh whipped cream instead. I also wish it had been served a little warmer than it was (it was room temp), but it was just a simple little apple tart. Not too sweet, just simple. And the creme brulee was well executed.

SERVICE:
Our waiter was awesome. Funny and friendly and knew the menu very well. Asked us if we needed anything at a couple points throughout the meal. Water was always filled. My only complaint is the lady who seated us was cloyingly polite, it was annoying.

First off, the fajitas. The servings are HUGE and all the fixins come out sizzlingly hot. My only minor gripe was the way the lettuce, sour cream, etc came out all on one plate. It made putting the fajita together a little tougher if there was something on there you didn't want.

But the real gem, crazy as it seems, are the firecrackers. See, I love poppers. They're spicy, fried and filled with cheese which basically makes them meet three of my four major food groups (the other being chocolate, of course). But the firecrackers aren't the wimpy frozen things you get at any pizza place in town. Oh no, these are huge singe-your-mouth peppers filled with a wonderfully melty gooey blend of cheeses and fried to crisp perfection. They're messy, certainly unhealthy and burn even my mouth a bit, but they are by far the best cheese-filled pepper concoction I've found.

Firecrackers = worth a whole new star.

The original hummus is soft and nutty just like Zahav/Dizengoff (sorry to pull so many restaurants into this, but I think alluding to them shows the high standard of quality Suraya meets).

The cases are filled with tempting treats, including cupcakes, cakes, pastries, cookies, and more.  We ordered a sugar cookie, a scone, a cupcake, a blondie, and a meringue cookie.  The sugar cookie was in the shape of a unicorn and tasted delightfully buttery and not too sweet.  The scone was packed with dried fruit and had just the right amount of crispness and richness.  The cupcake was a rendition of hot chocolate (their flavors range from ordinary to quirky to truly original).  The frosting actually tasted like a steaming mug of hot chocolate, while being light and fluffy at the same time.  The cake was one of the best cupcakes I've ever tasted.  Super light and yet very chocolatey.  I don't find cupcakes I like very often, as I find most of them to be sickeningly sweet, chemical-laden, or just lacking in flavor and texture.

Believe it or not, Chickie's actually serves as a neighborhood bar as well as a sports bar, so if you brave beyond your dining table towards the bar section you're likely to run into a few South Philly natives. 
The food is good, and splendid if we're talking crab fries (5/5 stars), I dream of crab fries and the ooey gooey cheese they come with. The crab fries served at the CBP and Comcast center stands just aren't the same. 
Other food is good too, but it's your typical bar food. I usually opt for the chicken tenders sandwich (3/5 stars), I wish it came with lettuce, or something other than fried chicken, mayo, cheese and bread... but I'm usually busy filling myself with crab fries while and before ordering it anyway. 
Drinkwise, I'm no beer drinker and the cocktails are alright, they're made from concentrate and mixes so nothing fancy like homemade simple syrups here, but they do the trick (if you don't like sweet drinks, you won't like these, they're extremely high in the sweetness factor). 
I appreciate the fact that most of the staff are brunettes (more power to us), and they're usually very friendly albeit extremely busy.

Although there were a couple of reviews that said Sbraga was overhyped, it stood out as a clear choice for our Friday night dinner (plus their 9 PM reservation had 1,000 OpenTable points (yes, I'm a points fanatic)).

Overall, I was very impressed by experience at Sbraga, the service was excellent and the ambiance was relaxed, yet chic with the right amount of noise and bustle.  

And the food . . . by an large was excellent, with only a few meh moments.  

Popover with Truffle Butter - warm, fluffy and with a distinct taste on its own without the truffle butter.  A great start to the meal.  I may or may not have also ate a significant portion of the BF's serving.

Foie Gras Soup - barf. barf. barf.  I just can't.  I have always hated foie gras and the soup form was no exception.  The BF who tends to be picky, however, loved it.  Apparently, you can ask for an alternate soup if you hate foie gras or are against if for ethical reasons, or whatever.  After taking a tiny spoonful of the foie gras soup, I patiently waited for the next course.  Within three minutes I was offered the Carrot Soup.  Thank goodness.

Carrot Soup -  mmm. mmm. delicious.  Creamy, but light.

First Course:
Hamachi Crudo - this was meh.  Yes, Hamachi is pretty basic and is rarely bad, but I've had some excellent Hamachi Crudo at Marea and L'Artusi, so it can certainly be done better than what was served at Sbraga.

Chicken Wing - the BF had this first course.  I tasted it.  it as okay -- a bit on the bland side.  It was deboned, breaded and fried.  The cream based sauce that accompanied it was slightly spicy.

Second Course:
Duck Bolognese - AMAZING.  The waiter said that this was among the best dishes on the menu and it exceeded my expectations.  Pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors blended perfectly.  I didn't want it to end.  I ate very slowly.

Saffron Spaghetti - the BF had this.  It was okay and very forgettable.  It definitely pales in comparison to the Duck Bolognese.

Third Course:
Game Hen - this was leg quarter and breast of the hen and also portions of a cool chicken salad.  I generally shy away from chicken entrees, but this was very flavorful and exceeded my expectations.

Fourth Course:
Cheesecake - the bf had this an thoroughly enjoyed it (this does not happen often).

Chocolate ""Crème"" - loved it.  this was very light and was mostly banana based.  There were approximately three banana flavors/objects on my plate (I believe a fermented banana, banana sherbert and some super tasty and amazing banana custard) and two chocolate (pebbles and ganache).  It was basically a party in my mouth.  I highly recommend it.

There were some highpoints and a few lackluster offerings, but overall Sbraga offered flavorful dishes that were traditional yet innovative.  I would certainly return during another visit to Philly.",2015-07-06 15:22:41,

A couple of things lacking but overall it was still awesome!  They have a Thursday special which is any large cheesesteak and a milkshake for $10.50.  I got a whiz with and a vanilla shake.

Cheesesteak-  They use really good meat here.  Its not all hacked up into pieces yet its not perfectly round slices of steak.  Kind of like a hybrid.  The meat was really good.  They load this thing up with a lot of onions too which I like.  The only thing I would change is the whiz.  It wasn't ooey and gooey...maybe it wasn't melted/heated enough???  Something was a little off with it.  The bread was good but a little too doughy.  Still a really good sandwich though.  If I ever go back, I'm going to order it with American cheese. (I read that American used to be the only way you could get a Chinks steak).

Milkshake-  Delicious!  Plain vanilla.  I believe they use Turkey Hill Ice Cream which is phenomenal.  Some of the best ice cream you can get!  You could taste the vanilla bean and it was blended perfectly so you could suck it through the straw without straining too hard.  A great milkshake!

Service-  The service was amazing!  The waitress was super friendly and very ""easy on the eyes"".  She got my buddy drink refills without asking and delivered us more napkins when she saw we had cheese running down our face...very attentive!

Out of 4 cheesesteaks on our trip, this would rank number 2 probably behind Steves Prince of Steaks.  I wouldn't recommend the whiz though.  Go with American and it would probably be a 5 star joint!  Total for 2 steaks, a Coke and a Milkshake was $22 and change.

The West Philly location has some virtues: The design is sleek, contemporary, and casual, and we were promptly seated and served. This was a nice change from the kitschy, cavernous Old City location, where you practically have to wave your arms around to attract a server, even when the restaurant is empty. Here, the atmosphere and service were an improvement (although my friend's dish inexplicably arrived five minutes before mine, and we had to listen to an even more inexplicable soundtrack of N'Sync and Nelly). 

I ordered the double-cooked chicken. This is a dish I've had dozens of times at the Old City location, where the chicken is served in lean, bite-sized slabs. Here, there were large, rubbery pieces of meat-- the sort you might expect of cheap takeout, but not of the supposedly best Chinese restaurant in Philadelphia. Next I ordered the Kung Pow Tofu--a safe choice, I thought, since I've enjoyed it at the Old City location, and since it did not involve meat. Again, it was nothing like its Old City counterpart, whose small-diced vegetables (onion, scallions, peppers, water chestnuts) give each bite variety and texture. The dish becomes pointless when a single bite consists of a massive, spongy tofu triangle, or a giant, blanched bell pepper. My friend's vegetable fried rice was tasty, if misleadingly named, since there were no vegetables in it.

I get that expansion often means a loss of quality control -- but would they try to sell this stuff in the recently opened New York location? Are they hoping that the nearby college campuses will provide a stream of customers regardless of quality?

I've told only a couple people about this meal since having it, and even then I felt like I was carrying on with superfluous details, unable to truly capture what made it so special.

All I'll say is that if you have an occasion worth celebrating and the means to celebrate it at Vetri, as well as a taste for fine food, you will not possibly regret eating here. Every single bite of food and sip of wine was something to savor. On more than one occasion my sister and I found ourselves musing, ""this is probably the best thing I've ever eaten."" Our menu was essentially entirely selected for us, and over the course of the meal we ended up trying at least 2/3 of the entire menu. I meant to take some pictures but by the time a complimentary spritzer and amuse bouche arrived at the table (immediately) I forgot I even owned a cell phone.

And while I hope that some day I will again experience food as wonderful as this, I cannot expect to ever have better service. From the moment we walked through the door, to the moment we left the table almost 4 hours later, there was not a single need unmet, question unanswered, glass left empty. The hospitality at Vetri is absolutely unmatched. They operate as a team with someone always alert to the tables' needs without it ever feeling like you're being watched. Everyone has a smile on their face and is willing to help in any conceivable way. I can't thank our main server, Bill, and sommelier, Bobby, enough for making the evening so relaxed and enjoyable. It was one of the best nights my sister and I have ever had together.

Lastly, I'd be remiss not to mention that what everyone has said is true:
Sweet onion crepe
Swiss chard gnocchi
Almond tortellini

I'm somewhere in between the folks who had food orgasms with every bite and folks who felt a little disappointed.  70% of everything we ate was exceptional.  What wasn't is a matter of personal taste and could easily be managed in a couple of ways.  Note that you do receive an evening's menu at the beginning of the meal--you can flag anything that doesn't sound good and more important can ask for particular dishes.  I recommend doing this.  

We asked to be surprised and this can go two ways depending on the restaurant, you can get something that's totally 'out of the box' or you might get something that many people aren't choosing on a particular night and the kitchen wants to push it out.  For our main protein, I ended up w. goat and it was way too smoky, maybe even a slight error in the execution, hard to say.  It was a but unpleasant, could have used another flavor or two to offset the smoke.  My friend had a small, very thin ribeye and thought there was so much sauce that it overwhelmed the meat.  Best practice would have been for us to send both dishes back and I'm certain the kitchen would have replaced them with something more appealing to us.  I realized this after the fact.  The pasta w. wild boar was gamey to me-but what did I expect. A boar wanders around the forest, getting in fights, snorting and eating bark--it's gonna taste gamey.  My friend traded dishes and he liked the boar.  

Desserts were excellent, but a small plate of tiny cookies afterward was a head scratcher, not particularly tasty or fresh. 

We chose the more expensive wine pairing and this was a highlight.  All of the wines were well matched to the food and the sommelier gives a basic history of how the wine was produced and what to expect when tasting, After the first two courses, I asked for no more white wine and they accommodated. The descriptions get a bit silly after awhile, ""This next wine is from grapes hand picked by Armenian/Swedish nuns in the South of Italy and then rolled across limestone for seventy four days, then dragged up the mountainside by children with severe overbites"" They honestly could have been making half of it up and I would not have known any better.  I circled two of the reds when we received our copies of the menu and wines at the end of the night and will order a bottle of each from a distributor--really striking and unusual. 

I'd like to see more vegetables on the menu which seem to disappear after the first appetizer.  This would add more texture to the dishes and some more interesting flavors.  Noticed that there's one sauce made of brown butter that showed up at least three times, maybe a bit of overkill.  While mostly absolutely delicious, and perfectly cooked, the dishes weren't particularly complex in flavor, Vetri seems slightly dated when looking at what chefs are producing these days.  The restaurant is still totally on top of its game in all respects, I just see slight room for improvement/updating w. some minor tweaks.  

With all that said, there were many, many, amazing bites that made our mouths pop.  The service is super friendly and professional.  It's surprisingly not an uptight place at all.  

Three hours passed quickly and I'll gladly go back.  It's a trip to an amazing food spa w. lots of butter!",2016-10-27 18:26:46,"{'food': ['appetizer', 'main protein', 'pasta', 'dessert'], 'drink': ['wine']}"

This visit is bitter-sweet, as I am departing the Philadelphia area for a new career opportunity.

While I know I will be back from time-to-time, as I do have family in the area, I still can't just pop on over to one of my favorites when I need a good friend's couch to sit on. Because of all realistic measures, that is exactly what Vientiane is - a good friend's couch that you can come hang out in a laid back and chilled BYOB atmosphere.


It's that friend that makes you that big bowl of comfort food to help you celebrate the highs or to crush to lows... and for all of the amazing experiences I have had here - I thank you! I thank you for making eating out and being social a possibility for a gal who has multiple food allergies, is a bit of a food snob, and living on a budget. You are amazing and I will continue to spread the word that all of Philadelphia needs to come check out Vientiane, if they have not already!


This evening, we were seated and handed the revamp menu - which, is visually much more appealing. It is also helpful that this menu consists of GF (gluten-free) codes so I know what is and is not safe for me.


I ordered a good classic for a table share - Lao Porridge (jow-piek) or congee. It is a smooth and comforting bowl of heaven - not too many more ways to explain it.  It is a subtle dish with simple flavors meant to heal. Good thing I planned on sharing and that I ordered the large because the entire table went nuts over it. P.S I order it with the soft tofu rather than fried - it is just a preference, but I think it makes a world of difference.


Then, despite having a huge list of things I wanted to try (aka the casserole, Laab, any of their fried rice dishes, Banh-Xeo, a dessert, and more.....) I had to go out with the first dish I ever ordered.......


Drum roll please..... the King Soup - or as I like to describe it as a Pho with coconut milk and much more spice! We all know I love coconut, love a creamy dish, and we LOVE spice - so win was always written all over this dish! Oh, and did I mention that they can make it gluten-free, vegan and it comes in a GIANT bowl for under 15!?


A friend of mine did order the new dish, Bamboo Stew (gang-naw-mai) which is bamboo shoots mixed with pumpkin and mushrooms (very earthy) and served with their famous sticky rice. Note, while this dish is not marked gluten-free, I am sure that if you ask, they are able to modify it for us gluten-free folks! 


In conclusion, it has been real Vientiane Cafe and I will certainly be back to visit! In the meantime, keep making some more awesome additions to your menu and oh, if any of my readers try the other dishes on my wish list, PLEASE SEND ME REVIEWS!


Until next time.

I almost always think 'That person was probably just being an ass'. I wish so badly that Bareburger hadn't disappointed me over and over and over and over (you get the point)...

The biggest problem- Orders for pickup and delivery are ALWAYS wrong. This is not an exaggeration. On more than 6 occasions consecutively, they have either given wrong orders or food has been completely missing. On other occasions they'll call and tell us they are out of something, offer to sub it, then the order is still wrong. My boyfriend and I have, more than once, made bets that go like this. ""How long before they call and tell us they're out of (insert desired order)"", or ""What's the over-under on our sides being missing?""
We've complained, politely, we've given them chance after chance because we love the food. But we can't anymore. Their promises that it won't happen again and their offers to reimburse aren't worth the frustration of half a meal being missing or wrong. Tonight's missing slaw was the last slaw straw.

Other problems- ""Business hours"" seems to be a loose term. They will stop seating, stop serving, or down right be closed before their posted hours. I have no idea how to determine the rhyme or reason for this. This type of willy-nilly schedule must be a luxury...I wonder if they're hiring...
-Service is questionable. I understand working in food service, I've been there. And I'll be the first to admit that people are the worst (some people take to the internet to rant about food...). But faking enthusiasm is a must if you are truly miserable and work at a restaurant. The people working at Bareburger are somehow able to make you feel like YOU have kicked a puppy in front of children when all you did was ask a friendly question. The DMV would be proud.

My wife and I ordered a cheeseburger with all the veggies on the side, an order of fries, an order of onion rings, a shake and a soda. My wife and I were sharing a burger and she does not like veggies and I do.  The shake and the soda came out right away.  The burger took over 40 minutes!!!  Yes 40 minutes for a burger, fries and onion rings!!!  When it did come out it had veggies on it, the rings and fries came out before the burger, the rings were cold.  They went and fixed our burger, but we think they did not remake our burger just scraped off the veggies and my wife said she could still taste pickles on the burger.  The waiter also stated that they cook all burgers to medium.  Well, ours was well done!!  It also was not very busy in there so not sure how it takes 40 minutes for a burger!!!  I would not recommend this place!  As a matter of fact while I was in our hotel elevator, someone said the food at our hotel was bad, which was true, so I told them if they want good food and service, do not go to Bareburger!!  I did recommed Bud and Marylin's and Locust Rondevous to the couple in the elevator.  (See my reviews for those establishments).

What makes Primos hoagies so delicious is the perfectly crispy, toasted original Primo's Brand rolls. It's all in the roll if you ask me.

Honey's has the look and feel of a roadside cafe that once peppered the interstates of the south. Heading up the Natchez Trace from New Orleans to Nashville, pull over and get some fresh fried chicken in a brown paper bag type of place...

As I entered the restaurant I could tell that the renovations and new layout worked very nicely.  The bar is off to the left and it seems that they have their ""quick-fire"" kitchen out in the open so you can see the kitchen staff hard at work.  Nice touch.

We all went for the tasting menu and it is a value.  For my first course, I went with the truffled chicken caesar salad.  While this may seem like a very safe bet I can assure you that the homemade dressing had the zing of anchovies and they spared no expense on the insane amount of truffle on the chicken.  I did get a taste of the sweetbreads which where quite crispy and delicious.

Second course, fish and chips.  Oh my God.  These were just ridiculously good.  The fish was fried perfectly (aka, light, not oily) and the few chips were cooked nicely as well.  What made this dish stand out was the use of curry in both the batter and sauce and thinly sliced jalapeno.  It just made it delectable.  Really, you've gotta try them.

Third was the lamb belly with an avocado puree.  It was delicious and I expected it to be that way.  The plate was highly artistic and very rich in flavor.  The portion size was also substantial.

Now on to the problem...I ordered the fried chicken cause I heard it was awesome.  What a disappointment this was.  The pieces were small and were very dried out.  The breading on the chicken reminded me of a shake and bake type of a texture and was one of the worst fried chickens I have ever had.  It's pretty bad when you say that Popeye's chicken was better.  I had the greens as one of my sides which was very very tasty and ordered a Big Ass Biscuit which was blah.  If you are calling something a Big Ass Biscuit it should be really big and not just the size of a Grands Pillsbury Biscuit.  It was very dried out and the butter the offered with it just crumbled the biscuit as you spread it.

Typically I'm hesitant when trying korean fusion dishes as I often feel like the flavors aren't handled properly when trying to americanize or change traditional korean foods (or maybe I'm just a korean food snob? or both??) but I must say... I loved my experience at Southgate this past weekend! 

I started brunch off with their kimchi blood mary, which was spicy! I was actually very happy with the spice level but also how they use kimchi to elevate the bloody mary. I didn't think it was too overwhelming which was what I was embracing for. I enjoyed the spicy house-made soju shot that it was paired with as well. It was like a nice little cool down break from the kimchi Bloody Mary :)

My friends and I decided to do tapas style for brunch so we could taste as many things as possible. Best idea ever! We started with the kimchi deviled eggs which were tasty. Again, I am pleased that they were able to subtly infused the kimchi within the dish, which wasn't overwhelming or overbearing by any means. But it also wasn't just adding kimchi on top of a traditional deviled egg. I believe they blended the kimchi and some sesame oil in the egg mixture which really just made the mixture smooth with a hint of sweet and spicy. They had four pieces so it's easy to share.

For our entrees, we ordered the kimchi poutine, short rib and korean fried chicken (KFC) and green tea waffles. It is hard for me to choose one clear favorite, mostly because I thoroughly enjoyed each dish. The kimchi poutine was delicious and I loved that the fries and cheese on the stone bowl continued to cook and get crispy even at our table. They don't have any gravy on this dish (like traditional poutine), but it works out very well. Very easy to share. The KFC and green tea waffles were a huge surprise to me. I wasn't expecting to enjoy the waffles that much, mostly because I wasn't too sure about green tea waffles... but it was very good! And paired with super crispy KFC was like icing on the cake. I wish the chicken was spicy though, that would have definitely put it over the top for me and been a favorite. Lastly, the short rib dish was good though it doesn't stick out as much as the other two. My friends really enjoyed the short rib itself, but I was under the impression it was suppose to be like galbi so that let me down a bit--still good but just not what I had been expecting. The short rib was placed in a huge bowl with rice, two eggs and jalapeños. The nice surprise was the sweet soy sauce at the bottom of the bowl, where the rice was soaking it up--it really brought the dish together.

Overall, Southgate is a wonderful place to experiment with Korean fusion dishes. One of my friends had never had korean food before and really enjoyed our dining experience here. I like that they offer a variety of things outside what you'd expect. I will most definitely come back here for brunch the next time I'm in Center City!

My boyfriend lives right around the corner, so we have passed it a million times, but it never caught our attention until we saw the deal online.

A lot of places won't include the tentacles, but Marmont did- they are our favorite and they were very tender!

You can choose either American, Whiz or Provolone- although I prefer whiz, american seems to be a favorite up here (for some reason, I feel sick eating it with sliced steak).

I specifically asked for them to be cooked in because I wanted a traditional Philly steak. I didn't complain and proceeded to eat what I had though. It takes a little time for them to cook the steaks because they are cooked to order and I was with a group who'd all already received their food.

*Warning* I am from the Philadelphia area and had to move away.  So this review may be a little biased because I miss C&P so much, but it is still such a wonderful place to go to if you ever visit Philly.  This particular one is a little far south of the city but right next to all of the stadiums.  The atmosphere is always jumping and the staff is always on point.  They have a HUGE bar and it really is not difficult to get a drink.  Try the YARDS beer.  Deliciousomaculet (just made that word up).  The ridiculously large projection screen in the corner for sporting events is a wonderment of awesomeness.  Come hungry, be happy, and you will have the time of your life.  

The best things on the menu that you have to buy:  Crab Fries, CRAB Fries,  then more CRAB FRIES dipped in the cheese sauce.  Mussels (in red), little neck clams, and the renovated Chickie Wings.  You also have to get a beer tower (size: two pitchers worth).  It is gaudy and annoying to have on the table, but it is just a tradition.. So do it!.  LOL.

Long wait on a weekend for dim sum - with inefficient service and low selection (comparing to next door). Questionable sanitary practices, especially in the summer when they leave the door open. They are more eager to seat you than serving you real food.

In the beginning when this place opened this was an iffy okay-ish place. But now - stay away for dim sum.

HOWEVER....

At your eatery/restaurant I should NOT

*Have to wait for almost two hours for food AFTER waiting a half hour to be seated, and another 20 mins to have someone come wait on you AFTER pulling any available server working the floor. No reason at all to have that much of a wait time (without being told from the beginning) no matter how busy you are or it being a holiday. Be honest up front about your wait times so that people can choose whether or not they want to stay.

*See roaches or any other types of insects/rodents  (roach fell out of takeout container)

*Servers who can't handle more than one table at a time or behave as I HAVE to give you my $. I don't care how good your food/product is, it doesn't compensate for quality customer service. One server was able to work four tables at one time making sure everyone was taken care of and even accommodated us when our server was often no where to be found or ignoring us. I usually don't tip anything less than 20% wherever I go and though I gave her a tip this is the first time in a long time that I've ever felt in a position to give anyone such a low tip smh
Hire competent staff who want to serve.

*If any of these offenses happen be courteous enough to earn your customer back with a complementary meal or comp card it doesn't have to be for much maybe half the meal or $25 towards a meal. 

20% is not enough to compensate for all of the above. It only came to about $7-9 off of the meal. Let me point out I don't mind paying for my food those were large portions and though I didn't expect a free meal, a little more could have been taken off of that bill.

*The staff (outside of our server) were pretty apologetic but in all honesty they MUST do better.

Although I have been many times and understand the various cuts of steak and flavors, the remaining 5 members in my party did not and when they are looking at a steaks ranging from $45 - $110 it would be nice to know what they are getting. 

Four of us decided on one of the two more flavorful cuts, the Chicago bone in ribeye.  Three of us were very satisfied with our choice and raved about the meat.  My husband however said it was just okay after eating most of it. We couldn't understand how he could say it was just ok...I tried his and he was right.  It tasted like something I would cook on my backyard grill. I then had him taste mine and he couldn't believe the difference. I suggested brining it to the attention of the waiter but he said no it was fine.  He now wishes he had at least mention the difference. 

The side dishes that I typically love were just okay. The ""giant"" baked potato I normally get was maybe a large standard potato and the sever that brought the condiments for the potato slapped the sour cream down splattering a large glob on the table.

I am so, so glad to have found this place (it was a fortunate discovery by chance-- I just happened to be browsing restaurants on Yelp, as I typically do, when I came across this place). I had to click on it-- 100 reviews and 5 stars on Yelp? It seemed too good to be true. I immediately contacted my friend and told her about the place; she was extremely ready to try it as well.

We ventured into the restaurant at around 7:20 PM. The place is fairly small-- there are only about 3-4 tables. The man who owns the place was incredibly warm, sweet and welcoming. We mentioned that we were newcomers and he immediately wanted to make sure we had a good experience with the food. He asked us for spice preferences and meat preferences for my friend (I told him I was vegetarian from the get-go). The food was made fairly quickly even though there were two parties of four ahead of us. Regardless, the wait time wouldn't make me subtract a star.

The menu of chaat varieties is extensive; I ordered the veggie chaat (I originally asked for the paneer veggie chaat, but he was out of paneer. Next itme!) The quality of the food was absolutely incredible. The combinations of flavors made each bite exciting and different. The chutneys mixed with the yogurt sauce, the fresh bits of mango pieces, raisins and chick peas and crispy flakes/puris added a cool texture to the dish as well. The play on sweet and savory was so on point. At the end of our meal, the owner told everyone in the restaurant (all tables were full so perhaps about 12 people) that he was heating up gulab jamun (indian sweet) for everyone on the house-- my friend and I were just about to leave and we were so full, but the thought was incredibly sweet and it just added to our experience. Another thing I noticed was that while we were eating, he announced to everyone that he hoped the spices were correct-- he mentioned being able to ""fix it up right away"" if someone had a dish with a spice level that wasn't ideal. So cute! So much appreciation! 

The restaurant also had a huge menu for lassi flavors. I'm not a huge lassi fan, but my friend ordered the Date lassi and really enjoyed it. All the other people in the restaurant ordered a lassi as well, so it is probably a worthwhile choice to complement the chaat.

I paid about $6.50 for my weal, and it was so worth it. I have nothing but golden and glittery words of praise for this West Philly gem. I have so many people in mind that I want to introduce to this restaurant.",2013-11-16 02:34:13,"{'food': ['veggie chaat', 'gulab jamun'], 'drink': ['lassi']}"

She was wrong...Look...Im usually not very picky, but why try to reinvent the wing???  I've had many wings from many different places and these are definitely on the lower spectrum of taste.  The chile sauce...was more like a chile pate that I could have put on my italian hoagie...it was basically chile seeds coated on a buffalo wing...It was both weird and disrespectful to wings!  One positive about the wings is that they were big...but they came out kind of soggy and most of the bones were broken, which makes them difficult to eat...and dangerous for your teeth/choking hazard. Ultimately, the wings were a total dud...
       Now for my wife's crab risotto...First and foremost...LAY OFF THE SALT!!!  Wow...way too much.  The concept of binding a crab cake with risotto sounded both interesting and delicious, but the cake had little flavor, except for the obvious dowsing of salt.  In addition to the crab being flavorless, the cole slaw that came with it was worse that ive ever had and the bed of french fries that the crab cakes sat on were under cooked and bland...Again...this meal was a total dud and 15 dollars to boot!  Money wasted.

First off, I love the interior decor. It's a very chill vibe. You can definitely see that Han Dynasty took the time to brand itself; it's not ""just another Chinese restaurant."" Mad props. Also, they were playing ""Bloom"" by Odesza at some point, so that's another ten bonus points to them haha. 

Came here with a group of six people. We wanted more space, since Chinese meals are usually to be shared, and circular tables are preferred. Unfortunately, the circular tables were reserved, but they were accommodating enough, and put two rectangular tables together for us. I say ""accommodating enough,"" because I feel like one of the waitresses was lowkey judging us. 

Anyway, when it came time to order, my parents tried to speak Chinese to the waiter, but he didn't understand Chinese, so I ended up trying to translate all the Chinese items into English. This was kind of annoying, so if you want to order in Chinese, just be aware that some of the waiters don't speak Chinese. For me, it was fine though, because I'm a total ABC and prefer to speak in English LOL. 

So anyway, on to the food. Food was SPICY. Spicy, but good. We ordered a bunch of stuff, but barely made a dent in most of them (眼大肚子小, amirite??). That said, it really was great food. Without further ado, here's what we ordered: 

Dumplings in Chili Oil: This was hella spicy, so I didn't eat much. It was alright, not amazing. I wouldn't order again. 

Eggplant w/ Garlic Sauce: This was pretty good. A bit more solid than I would have liked though. I'm used to more mushy eggplant, so I can mix it with my rice. Is that me being weird, or is that a legit preference?? I have no idea. But yeah, overall, good taste. Would order again. 

Cumin Style Lamb: This was yummy! The lamb was tender. It was REALLY spicy though, so if you can't handle spice very well, do not order this. I was spiced OUT while eating this. The flavor was good though. I probably wouldn't order this again though, because too spicy for me. 

Dry Fry Fish: OMG, this MADE the meal. I freaking loved this stuff. If I didn't have such a low tolerance for spicy stuff, I would've eaten the whole dish. It's spicy, but it also has this subtly sweet undertone. You don't expect that when you look at it, but when you taste it, it's such a nice surprise. I'm in love with this fish, and I'd go back to Han Dynasty just to taste this dish again. 

Oh, also I forgot to mention that we came in around 1pm, and it wasn't crowded at all. More people did come in at 2pm. 

Also, I think the service could've been a little better. I was spiced out and I wish they had filled my water more.

We had heard great things, and it was only a few blocks away.  It kind of felt like a hole-in-the-wall kind of place.  There was a shop front where you could order pastries and drinks to go, and in the back were tables and seats.  We were greeted by the one waiter who was running the restaurant at the time and he told us to sit anywhere.  It was relatively empty, but expected for a Friday morning. We took a table in the back.

After reading some recommendations and browsing through some photos, we ordered the sweet potato fries, the eggs benedict, and the sweet potato hash.  The food portions were huge, and we definitely didn't need to order the sweet potato fries.

The sweet potato fries were thin and crispy, lightly salted with large flecks of sea salt.  I love sweet potatoes but what really made the dish was the side of sour cream and sweet chili sauce-- a dip into the sour cream and then the chill sauce was this delicious combination of sweet, creamy, and salty all at the same time.  We ate half the bowl before we started to realize that our stomachs were getting full (the bowl was that big.), and decided we still needed to save some room for the main course.

I had the sweet potato and sausage hash and it was delicious.  The sunny side egg perfectly spilled all over the sweet potato and sausage and made this gooey, sticky sauce.  It was delicious.  The sweet potato was a good alternative to the traditional potato, lightening the dish, which was needed after being smothered in the heavy yolk and mayo sauce latticed on top.  Served with two slices of bacon, too.  Although I didn't try the eggs benedict, it looked really good as well.  The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and delicately spilled over the english muffin. 

Like I said, the portions were huge, and I could only finish half my dish.  We took the rest home to enjoy later.  One nuisance was that Ants Pants is cash only--but they do have an ATM in store.  Service was very attentive and friendly.

MeExr1aAvnRuXBH_aRwdIA,6f7er5Gs5bruu7yEqiW2bw,EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ,5,0,0,0,"One word to describe Village Whiskey. Decadent. Massive selection of whiskeys, duck fat fries and burgers with foie gras. Of course, for all of this, there is a price to be paid. The first is that the bill will be substantially more than your typical burger joint (which it is not) and the wait for a table will be long as the restaurant is small. Besides those two things, Jose Garces did an amazing job here. 

To start, I love going for a bourbon/whiskey based cocktail like an Old Fashioned and trying one of their many bottles of whiskey. I don't find any of their bar snacks to be that great. For me, it really starts with the pickled Herb Cherry Tomatoes and the Beets. It's nice to start out with and have on  the side to counter the heart attack from the burger and fries.

Both the Duck Fat Fries and the Short Rib & Cheddar Fries are great. If you can handle the extra salt, go all out with the Short Rib Fries and feast. In terms of burgers, I've only tried the Village Burger with additional toppings and the Whiskey King. The Whiskey King was extremely rich and heavy, and getting it once was enough for me. For toppings, choose whatever you please. My only advice would be to avoid the Horseradish Crab Salad as it was almost unbearably salty (I love salt). 

Overall, Village Whiskey makes one of the best burgers that I've ever eaten. It's a staple when I'm craving a burger and I am never disappointed by it.

In addition, knowing that we were arriving late, the room was fully paid for to secure the requested room, and a follow up phone call was made two weeks prior this trip.

Upon arrival, there was only one full bed. Due to the late arrival, they were unable to accommodate any room switch. When calling in the morning, I was told that people still needed to check in and they would see what they could do. Considering the fact that we were here for a rather large conference, I knew the chances of obtaining a room as the day went on. Further more, I do not understand why they ""needed to see who else needed to check in"" when our room was reserved and fully paid for. 

This room also is a handicap accessible room, which means that there are shower accommodations, and there is a handheld shower head. When the shower head is on the stand, it shoots right at the wall which makes it difficult to just shower. 


I know that Loews has a great reputation, but this visit is very disappointing and just unacceptable. Clearly, despite having reservations, they blatantly do not have any care for their paying customers.

They were actually holding the crust and biting into the pizza, whereas we were scooping our toppings off the plate.  So perhaps it is just this style of pizza that needs help.  I don't know.

I never know what to get - since I do not actually like drinking alcohol, so I always ask the server to recommend something I could sip without wanting my fiance to finish it for me. Many have tried to find a drink like this for me, and they all failed. Well, all except sweet Erica.  Thank you Erica! 

We both got the NY Strip Steak, Amazing! It was so perfectly cooked and melted in our mouths. Will be sure to come again whenever in Philadelphia. Also got the bacon and onion mac and cheese - very rich in flavor but also amazing. The grilled asparagus was delicious - drizzled with balsamic. MMMM.. And the carrots were to die for. Whatever wasn't finished had to come home with us so i could eat it again!

DESSERT: Dan got the Creme de burle and even i liked it - very good. I got the blueberry and peach crisp..... It was so good, i almost wish I didn't eat so much so i could have finished it. It was so flavorful and perfect.

Be prepared for a more ""lively"" environment if they do have parties however. A smidge loud. Nothing we personally minded. 20% gratiuity is automatically added to tables of six or more. 

Our bottle was opened immediately after being seated and we were presented with knotted rolls and garlic oil right away. Our server Jenny was incredible through the entire meal! Quick with ingredient lists, recommendations and water refills. Friendly and efficient! 

We started with the arincini which were huge, and the cauliflower, both very well received. The cauliflower despite being very lightly breaded was indeed vegan! (No egg wash!) It was served with a tasty, perfectly spicy fra diablo for dipping. I had this as part of my main meal and couldn't get enough of it!! I ate a ton and still had some to take home! Incredible side! 

**There's also a vegan pie, Brussels, and zucchini which are all dairy free too! Can't wait to return and try them as well! 

The table also ordered chicken parm pie which was a bit more than individually sized, the penne vodka with seasonal vegetables and the porcini ravioli. The ravioli was a fan favorite and said to be one, if not THEE best mushroom ravioli we've EVER had! 
A must try. We also couldn't help but noticed the insane towering impressive slice of lasagna our neighbor was diving into. Wow!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last time around, The Spot didn't blow me away, but it wasn't half bad. So in an attempt to see what their pizza and wings were like, the GF and I decided to check them out again. I'm glad we did.

Large Special Pizza [$15.99]
Pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, onions, mushrooms, green peppers

First thing's first. For us, it's not about the pizza at The Spot. It was a bit soggy, but the dough was decently seasoned and the veggies seemed fresh. Overall, it was alright, but there are certainly better pizzas out there like Lazos Pizza & Grill.

Special Chicken Sandwich [$7.99]
Lettuce, tomato, provolone, bacon, Russian dressing

The GF was in the mood for a chicken sandwich so was happy with this effort. The chicken was crisply fried, juicy, and decently seasoned. The Spot seemed to have forgotten the provolone, but the Russian dressing helped to amp up the sandwich a bit. And waffle fries? Nothing wrong with those!


Boneless Buffalo Wings [$13.29]
20 pieces; half mild buffalo, half BBQ

The real star for us though? The boneless wings. Now let me tell you - I'm personally a bone-in man myself. But for the GF's sake, I deal with boneless. And with The Spot's iteration, I have no qualms with that at all. These were incredibly moist, perfectly crispy and both sauces were on point. The buffalo was slightly spicy and the BBQ was not overly sweet and definitely had nice smoke to it. 

So if you're in the mood for wings or have a somewhat finicky partner, definitely check out the wings here. There's easily some of the best boneless wings in Center City.",2014-06-14 16:30:03,"{'food': ['Pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, onions, mushrooms, green peppers', 'Lettuce, tomato, provolone, bacon, Russian dressing', 'Buffalo wings'], 'drink': []}"

I've been here previously several times, but I'll just mention the last time I came here for dinner. As usual, this place was pretty busy (even though my friend and I arrived pretty late, around 9). Nevertheless, we were quickly seated at one of the hightop tables. We decided to order with University City Dining Days and ended up with a ton of food (we might have even been able to split 1 ""meal"" between the two of us). We chose the dan dan noodles (which are a classic), hot pot style (which featured tender and spicy chicken), and kung pao chicken (which was also very tasty). For dessert, I chose to get the Grand ""Royale"", which was actually a lot stronger than I expected, but still was great. My friend got the 2 special macarons, which had super unique flavors. I tried a bit of the macarons, and I didn't really like the ""spicy citrus chocolate"", which tasted like it contained a ""ginger""-y flavor.

A few tips: try the dan dan noodles (unless you have peanut allergies) and don't be afraid to adjust the level of spicy according to what you feel is good. 

I'm usually skeptical of nice-looking places having great authentic chinese food (a bigger fan of authentic hole-in-the-wall locations), but there's really no getting around the fact that Han Dynasty is amazing.",2015-07-18 06:37:30,"{'food': ['dan dan noodles', 'hot pot style', 'kung pao chicken'], 'drink': []}"

So it was happily surprising, even for an appreciator of both meat and fake meat, but it went downhill from that. 

First I see a highly patronizing, crabby sign that says  something to the degree of, figure out if you are a vegetarian or a meateater and order accordingly. And no, you can't return your sandwich if it's wrong. I don't understand how there are love notes to this place in loopy handwriting next to this sign. 

Then, the conversation with the  went like this with the underage cashier:
Me: what kind of cheese do you have?
Him: mozarella, cheddar, american, provolone, cheese whiz, vegan, etc.
Me: okay, I'll have cheddar on my gigi special (that's the vegetarian cheesesteak which btw, turned out sort of bland and I'm sure full of dye and chemicals.)
Him: oh, we're out of cheddar
Me: (thinking it was retarded of him to mention cheddar when they were out of it). Okay, American. 
Him: fine. drink?
Me: a water please
Him: oh we're out of waters too. Sorry!
Me: okay, a Sprite I guess.

Philadelphia is not a coffee city. Things seem to be improving here, but Philly still has catching up to do compared to other North American cities.

La Colombe is probably one of the best two or three coffee roasters in the city and their beans are available widely in stores throughout the city.

At home, I own an automatic espresso machine (a Gaggia) as well as a Chemex pour-over carafe. I don't really think La Colombe's espresso is good enough for me to buy and make at home. But, some of their other roasts are good enough that I will buy the Afrique blend to make in Chemex. 

At around $10 for a 12 oz. bag of beans, the price isn't bad considering the quality. I think the coffee that The Head Nut, also a local roaster, offers is just as good as La Colombe, if not better. The Head Nut's prices vary by blend, but are slightly cheaper than La Colombe. With La Colombe you pay a bit more for their bourgeoisie branding experience, but at least the product tastes good.",2014-02-25 05:33:26,"{'food': [], 'drink': []}"

You can see him all night working in the kitchen running the orders.  I started with a glass of Gewurztraminer at the bar while I waited for the rest of our party.  Bonus points for serving that wine by the glass, it's one of my favorites and hard to find at Philly restaurants.  

The tasting menu is the way to go, unless you just want to order something at the bar.  After we ordered, we each received a delightful brioche muffin filled with cheese and truffle.  It was awesome.  

My first course was the sweetbreads.  I don't usually order sweetbreads, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and they were really tasty and crispy, served with a lemony sauce and roasted tomatoes.   

Second course was the arctic char with a hollandaise sauce.  The fish was cooked perfectly, and I was really happy with the option because I've loved arctic char ever since I had it at Le Bec Fin, and I don't see it offered too often.  The sauce was perfect as well, buttery and lemony, but not too heavy.  

Third course was the meatloaf with bacon marmalade.  Again, super delicious.  Bacon marmalade belongs on everything.  A certain food blogger friend should consider replicating it.  The meatloaf had some Italian seasonings, and was very flavorful.  Also, the mashed potatoes that came with were creamy and delicious.

Fourth course was the cheese plate.  I probably should have written down the names of the cheeses because they were perfect.  They came with two pieces of toast and a fig cake that tasted like the inside of a fig newton.  

Service was stellar as well.  There was some kind of issue between our first and second courses so they knocked a few drinks off the bill.  I understand that things happen, and I appreciated their pro-activeness to rectify the situation, and when we left the waiter kept apologizing about it and saying he hoped we would be back.

dwb1TuH_x7jP_vA7lcveOg,iFWbakQXjINMq6ldP14dug,REns5fQe45Nk_D2UwQyr0w,1,4,0,0,"If my experience at Barra today (Wednesday, Nov 18, 2015 at 12 noon for lunch) is any guide, then this restaurant is a complete waste of time and money; to put it a little differently, even with a Groupon that provided $20.00 of food for $8.80, the place wasn't worth it; or to put it another way, if a crack in the earth opened up right below Barra, which was then sucked into an abyss and never heard from or seen again, it would not be missed by the restaurant community of Philadelphia.  

Here is why I am so negative about this place (which is, by the way, at night a bar and hookah club that perhaps is okay, but in this review I am merely addressing the quality of the food and the management's ethics): 

I had ordered an entree that was supposed to be a half-chicken, plus side of roast potatoes, and some broccoli. Even though there was no queue (I was the only person at a table), the kitchen took 30 minutes to prepare my dish, which, when it came out, consisted not of a half-chicken, but rather two minuscule pieces of chicken (a leg and a portion of a breast, perhaps of a capon or some other kind of miniature bird or baby bird), plus the potato and vegetable.  

When I protested to the server (Tianna, a very nice person who, I hope, can manage to get another job--elsewhere), she in turn sent over the owner, a Mr. Ahmad (sp?), who agreed with me that a half-chicken should consist of a leg, a thigh, a breast and a wing.  He apologized for the confusion caused by the fact that his cook was only working there one month (what an explanation!), and promised that in 15 minutes a new dish would come out of the kitchen with a real half-chicken on it!  We also agreed that the potato and vegetable would NOT be warmed over, but rather prepared anew.

The promises were not kept.

Rather, what came out, 28 Minutes Later (not 15 minutes) was the following:
1. the same two pieces of miniature chicken (the leg and breast, now quite thoroughly dried out);
2. a third piece of miniature chicken, perhaps a portion of a breast, not a dried out as the other two;
3. but there certainly was no wing (maybe it was so small or lightweight that it just flew away before the plate arrived at my table);
4. moreover, the broccoli was NOT (as promised) newly prepared, but the same old stuff, now soggy from overcooking, albeit enhanced by some green pepper which, having been cooked only once, not only was fine; however, this disparity also made it painfully clear, by way of comparison, that the broccoli had been (excessively) warmed over;
5. and finally, the roast potato side was NOT (as promised) prepared over from scratch, but rather was the same old potatoes, now enhanced (?) by their having been sauteed in oil with onion; and as with the broccoli, because the added element (earlier green pepper, now onions) tasted fine, it merely underscored the fact that the principal item (earlier broccoli, now potato) had been overcooked via re-warming.

Good grief!  

So, I left a 20% tip for Tianna (after all, it really wasn't her fault that the owner and/or cook are abysmally unprofessional), and then I went home and called a couple friends, urging them to cancel Groupons that they themselves had purchased for this pathetic joke of a dining establishment. 

Most ""new"" restaurants are out of business within two years; very few survive for a lifetime, like Bistro Romano, which is just a few blocks away.  Barra's food operation (again, I don't know about the bar or hookah club) deserves to go out of business IMMEDIATELY.

My dinner companion and I splurged on the fries, with cheddar and short ribs, which could have been our entire meal. I've rarely had anything so heavenly, you just need to experience it for yourself. 

We each ordered a burger - stellar on both counts (though my friend thought the thousand-island dressing was unnecessary and distracting) - but the fries, oh the fries! 

Though the restaurant is surprisingly small, it feels spacious, no doubt owing to the lofty ceilings. The walls are done gorgeously in subway tiles and the bar is a rather impressive sight. 

The tables (high tops - good choice) serve comfy leather banquettes that line the wall opposite the bar, so if pressed, you can squeeze three or four people around the table, without having to deal with bulky chairs. 

This place is not good for groups if you want to sit and eat, or even if you want to stand at the bar. Come to think of it, unless you are seated at the bar or at a table, there is really no room to stand and have a drink except in the back ahllway by the bathroom.  We arrived at 6:30pm on a Monday night and still waited a half an hour for a table.

Really, people, 3 stars??

However, it is no surprise that this section has gotten some of the douchiest reviews imaginable.  After all, South Philly is now festering with hipster douchery, and these people can't just experience a good thing and let it be.  Here are my retorts to a few of the negative comments I read here:

1) Yes, plantains are generally a garnish.  Especially when they're flash-fried or sauteed and not cooked slowly as to caramelize extensively, in which case they can serve as a sweeter side.
2) Jerking, like BBQing, softens bone (esp chicken bone) to the extent that the meat can be chopped with the bone after it is finished cooking.  Hence the bones in with the pieces of chicken.  If you can't figure out a way around them, well...Darwin.
3)  $15 is reasonable for half a chicken and a huge container of rice, especially in the middle of a major American city.
4)  Rice (and the beans and cabbage) served with jerk chicken is not in of itself meant to have a high flavor profile.  You put the (extremely) flavorful chicken on top.  The rice mellows out the dish.    A dish is the sum of its parts; stop critiquing every single component like you're some sort of expert (which you're not, probably on anything, and definitely not on the way cabbage should compliment starch and protein in Jamaican cuisine).  
5)  This is how its done in Jamaica.  If something did not turn out the way you expected, its because you were wrong .   You know who wasn't wrong?  The Jamaican cook who makes Jamaican food for a living.  What are the sheer odds of you being right?   Are you crazy?  
6)  Which brings me to my last point: Jamaican culture is on island time.  This is a fact, not a silly stereotype.  Jamaica is probably the only country the stereotypes surrounding which are all true.  Which is fine because they're all pretty cool stereotypes.  Ever see a Jamaican movie villain?  Its impossible.  So yes, the service might be a little slow when it gets slammed - as happens anywhere.   BYOB to pass the time, and just try to sit and enjoy yourself instead of knit-picking at every tiny little thing around you.  

PS  Maybe your server would approach your table faster if you didn't have a handlebar mustache and fedora on.  You're not allowed to make culinary critiques while looking like you work at a carnival.  Go back to the suburbs.  

Sorry, that's the rant of someone who worked in restaurants for 10 years, and who has also eaten some very good homemade Jamaican food.

Maybe it's for inspiration, maybe it's to make sure you don't copy from someone else... either way, as I begin to write this review, I see someone describing their brain as Fred (Flinstone) and Biff (the only Biff I know is from Back to the Future) - Fred enjoying large portions of meat and potatoes, Biff enjoying Sbraga. 

Directly underneath the psychoanalysis we've got a lady talking about giving an ""O"" for the server, Tomas, and how she ""forevermore"" wants to hear his voice in her head (I know, taken out of context, or even in context, this one is a little steamy). 

And then the final review in the fold describes portions so small it'll prevent this starved person from ever returning (1st world problems, I assure you). Anyway, I really wanted to share that.

*** AND NOW THE REVIEW ***

Just barely missed a 5. I'll be up front so there's no agonizing wait - I wasn't a fan of my third, which has a supplemental cost ($18 beyond the $45): the Wagyu steak with a poached egg. I didn't realize until I was eating, but that was my first steak and eggs experience. It's served in a broth that makes everything, well, wet. I don't like my meat wet. It wasn't bad at all, just wasn't my thang.

She didn't like part of her deconstructed tiramisu - I loved it, but I have to represent all sides here... the part she didn't like? The frozen coffee shavings (they're delicious - get it).

Everything else? Fantastic!

Service - excellent, friendly, helpful.

Menu - four courses, $45 - first, second, third, dessert.

Do you get to see the celebrity chef who won Top Chef, Kevin Sbraga? YES - he's cooking in the open kitchen, and often does. 

What'd we get? 

Firsts: foie gras soup and fried green tomato (comes with smoked sweetbread). Interesting notes on the firsts - if you're not a fan of foie gras, GET THIS SOUP. I'm not a fan, and loved it. Served atop white rose petals, onion, and pumpernickel cubes. 

Same deal with the sweetbreads that accompanied the fried green tomato. Not a fan of them, but these were done so well that I didn't even think about it. The dish was like a deconstructed BLT.

Seconds: Parsley, Pork Belly, Escargot, and Mushroom Risotto (what a mouthful: both in writing and in tasting), AND the sturgeon with kimchi, bok choy, and a red wine apple puree. To steal from Campbell's - mm mm good. 

Thirds: You already know about my wagyu experience. She had the pork loin with pickled strawberries, sesame crunch granola, and leeks. What a tantalizing combination. The strawberries with the pork... oh baby. 

Dessert: Chocolate tart with pistachio ice cream... really nice. The tart is soft and is cradled in a soft yet substantial crust; combined with a bit of the ice cream and oof - bliss. I already told you about the tiramisu... get it =)

Everything looked beautiful, tasted great, and again, the service was very solid. We even struck up conversation with our neighboring diners.

Ambiance was very traditional Old World Italian. Old B/W photos of family adorned the wall, antique tiles on the floor, you know the deal. Seating was very tight in the front where I sat (didn't get to see the other dining room that they have), but I was able to hold a convo with no difficulty.

I'm not sure what was supposed to be in that burrito, but it tasted like a whole lot of rice with a helping of salty paste stuffed in the corner. The bento also came with your standard salad w/ ginger dressing, and a MASSIVE helping of [rather mediocre] potato salad, of all things.

He said, ""It's unusual that I don't know where we are going. Generally, I make the reservation and I pick the restaurant."" The restaurant was quiet for a week night. We were led to the window table. He marveled at the seating selection. There were two best seats in the house. He said. One in the middle but with a bit of privacy. The other by the window. The one in the middle was already taken and we were given the window seat, aka the best seat in the house that was available. I took a mental note. 

Philadelphia has adopted a lot of New York style dining. Prix Fixe menu was abundant. Sbraga offers a $55 per head, four course meal. For what they serves up, it's an incredible deal. 

Gruyer popover and foie gras soup to start. Rich and flavorful. 

Hamachi ceviche next. It might be the best I've ever consumed in my life. Lamb tartare had a middle eastern flair to it. Very inventive. The next dish is a pasta dish, jerk lamb bolognese and spaghetti with blue crab were incredibly flavorful.

Ordinarily we'd have enough to eat but we continued with the entree. He opted for surf and turf and I had the fish. It's interesting when you have so many creative dishes on the offering, the dining options essentially become a careful balancing act between what you had previously had and what you would have on the next dish. We were deeply satisfied with our mains. The dessert choices were relatively easy. Sweet corn turnover and cheese.

Cheese course as the last dish is brilliant, and thankfully, this being Philly, they don't charge you extra. Most European restaurants offer cheese course as a dessert course. Nice to have them to include it. 

We did not spend a lot of time talking. We ate. And we ate.

Sbraga's Top Chef is gifted, crafty and creative.  The attention to detail and the use of varied ingredients were better than an above average pricy San Francisco restaurant. When I worked in Philly in the 90s, I remembered the food was already fanciful. It only improved more ever since then. Just then, it dawned me that Sbraga is listed as one of the 38 essential restaurants in Philly by Eater, and that's how I made the reservation. 

Satisfied, I expressed my interest in coming back here. He interpreted it as my general endorsement of Philly, which he frequented for work.  ""Will you come back with me?"" He asked. When I did not answer straight away,  the question became a statement: ""You are coming back with me.""",2015-11-21 09:31:57,

But my first (and likely only) dining experience there was one of those that was tainted by the haze of mood-altering blood sugar levels from ridiculously long wait times which were compounded by loud and obnoxious clientele* that I think the management are letting ruin their establishment. 

In most cases any place is worth a second chance since I know there are always extenuating circumstances: their top server has mono, a shipment of Jerk seasoning is stuck on route 95, they had to physically go slaughter our dinners and the chickens were riled up from the flash mob on South St. But after reading past reviews apparently deplorable service has been the norm since they started riding the coattails of being in the film In Her Shoes. Additionally, even though the curry goat was pretty tasty two hours after I ordered it, I consider the pains I'm still having in my gut 8 hours later as punishment for not trusting my instincts and getting the hell out of there when we first arrived. The back of the house told us to check-in up front, the front told us to check-in out back, a reservation book inside had nothing written in it (funny, considering we all had a few to contribute by then.) All of this should have been a big warning sign.

*In hindsight I realize that the additional charges (listed below) mentioned on page 2 of the menu were most likely created to discourage college kids from coming in to take advantage of the BYOB and 'drinking under the radar' (made obvious by the overly drunk girl who needed help both walking to the bathroom and holding her hair back.) Not only does it ruin the experience for the grown ups who can hold their liquor but it's ineffective and unnerving, especially in a place that seats at least 50 people and has only one bathroom. It's also absurd for already overpriced food, less-than-stellar service, wait times, plastic cups, etc. Then they don't even honor their own fees since the only add-on we were charged was 4 $3 corkage fees, which didn't even add up to what we actually consumed!
- $12 minimum to sit on the patio, 
- 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more, 
- $4 entertainment fee on Fri and Sat nights and a

The inside is quite small and people ended up staying and chatting after their meals to avoid the freezing cold temperature outside so even though we went there on a Thursday evening, we had a 30-45 minute wait (which was passed in the gelateria across the street).

I really liked the vibe inside.  Very laid back, dark colors, seats all along the bar and tall leather couches and tables for eating.  

For an appetizer, we ordered the pickled green beans and shallots, which came with olive tapenade, homemade ricotta cheese and toasted sourdough bread.  Wow, it was really good!  The pickled veggies were perfectly briny, sour and a bit sweet.  I could probably eat a whole jar of them.  The tapenade and ricotta was tasty as well, especially smeared on the sourdough bread. I felt like they didn't give enough bread to accompany the plate though.

I ordered the regular village whiskey burger ($11) which came with lettuce, tomato and homemade thousand island on a sesame bun.  I added cheddar ($3.50 - a bit pricey) and onion (raw, which I think was free...otherwise caramelized onion would have been an extra $1.50, no thanks).

My boyfriend got the whiskey king burger ($26) which was a decadent smorgasbord (maple bourbon glazed cipollini, rogue bleu cheese,
applewood bacon, foie gras), and an order of duck fat fries with sly-fox cheddar sauce.

Both burgers were superb.  They were cooked perfectly medium rare, which kept the meat juicy and tender.  The meat itself was very beefy and tasty.  My regular burger was already pretty darn good, but the whiskey king was pure awesomeness.  It was SO rich with the foie gras, and the sweet maple bourbon sauce complemented the salty, smokey bacon very well.  Not sure if it warrants the $26 price tag though...

The duck fat fries were crispy, but the extra $2 for the cheddar sauce wasn't worth it.

Service was okay, could have been a bit more attentive, but we had an okay time eavesdropping and people watching while we waited for our food.

Vetri is not cheap. So if you're on a budget, save it for a special occasion. It's well worth it. Reservations can be hard to get, so call ahead at least a few weeks for a weekend. They start taking reservations 2 months in advance.

Price: $29
Pros: Hands down the best Roti and Satay I've ever eaten, 
Cons: The food was exceptionally spicy (I loved it so not a negative, just fair warning)

Thoughts: As our final meal for the day we settled on Penang mostly due to the amazing reviews for Roti which we both love. It also got phenomenal reviews for almost everything else. Apparently we got pretty lucky because when we showed up the restaurant was mostly empty and, based on reviews, the place can get very busy at times. The interior design was very interesting; some of the tables were small round steel tables that almost looked like a wok with a metal disk as a lid. Overall it looked very much like a Chinese market, and led to a unique overall décor choice. I've seen it done in a similar way several times but this was the first one that did it effectively.
Once we sat down and got our customary tea we put in our order we were surprised how quickly the food came out. We were unsurprised but delighted that both the roti and satay were delicious. The roti was thin but not too crunchy and the spicy peanut sauce was just mouth wateringly perfect, just the right level of spicy with plenty of flavor. The satay was perfect as well, crisp exterior with moist interior, tons of flavor cooked into the chicken, and the perfect sauce to accompany the chicken. We both loved the appetizers and would have easily eaten two of three of them.
Once we polished off the appetizers we moved onto the main course. Once we dug in, we confirmed my suspicion that my wife basically just doesn't like traditional Chinese food. The Curry Mee was honestly good, if exceptionally spicy, but neither of us liked it. I don't want to talk too much about it because I don't believe it was the quality of the food that caused us to not like it, it was just the type of food and I really don't want to knock a place because I don't like their type of food.
We absolutely loved the roti and satay, and I would go out of my way to eat here again. I'd probably try some other dishes as well and if you already know you like authentic Chinese then you should make sure to stop in,",2018-05-31 02:51:24,"{'food': ['Roti Canai', 'Chicken Satay', 'Curry Mee'], 'drink': []}"

Main point: This is one of my two favorite bars in Fairmount.  A laid-back establishment, London gets my vote because they offer a decent choice of local craft beer alongside imports and the occasional cask.  With regular specials including $3 drafts on Monday, it's a place to visit often.

In detail: As a small, neighborhood joint, the London is a close tie for my Fairrmount favorite.  Because of it's size, the cozy feeling it generates, and the awesome staff, it's much more welcoming than other local bars.  Although it can get crowded at times (the World Series was the most packed I had ever seen), it's still a relaxed place even with every seat taken.

Most nights offer a special deal, the best being $3 drafts on Monday, and $3 local brews on Tuesday and Wednesday (Stoudt's and Flying Fish) - although the later two deals may have changed as the Sunday Belgian deal has.  While you'll occasionally see cheaper draft nights at other bars, you won't be getting the same import and craft local beers.

With most grills, the vegetarian options are few.  I've had the vegetarian dishes available, and the nachos are pretty damn good for not specializing in Mexican cuisine.  Other options include salads and an eggplant Parmesan sandwich.

The only thing I would like to see change is a more frequent rotation of the draft beers - perhaps more casks or special additions.  Lack of local/regional brews is a deal-breaker for me, and London does not disappoint with this requirement of mine.  Usual locals include Yards, Philadelphia Brewing Co., Flying Fish, and Stoudt's.

I was torn between the brisket hash with poached eggs or the fish and chips, but was quickly informed they were out of the hash. We started with the soup of the day which was a cream of potato soup, which I knew was either burned or old or both when I first saw it, as it was not a creamy white but a very distinct tan in color. I had one bite, hubs thought it was okay and decided to finish it.

A fresh fruit salad is served complimentary to each table which was a pleasant surprise. Michael ordered the eggs benedict which can also be ordered eggs Florentine.

He had asked for them to add onions and peppers to his home fries and they were happy to oblige. He was thrilled with his order and raved over the home fries in particular. As a side he ordered bacon and their bacon is not wonderful, it was thin and very soft.

I loved their hand cut fries and you get enough to feed an army! Three pieces of fish topped my huge plate of fries, the breading was way too thick and not cooked on the inside, even though the fish was cooked perfectly throughout. I ate half of one piece and decided to concentrate on the fries, bringing the fish home to reheat in the oven until the breading was cooked. I like a good crunchy fish and this was certainly not the best I've ever had.

There is one restroom at the top of a very steep and very dirty flight of stairs, I don't think the carpets had been swept in quite some time, the restroom was clean.

This place is not family oriented, needs lot of organization, decoration and presentation is a mess. They barely have 10 tables and how they manage their kitchen supply is questionable. 

We live in the northeast and decided to check this place out. So the first time we visited them, the place was packed and we had to go back. The second time I called in for reservation to which they said I do not need one that day. We have heard great reviews about their duck dishes and so we had decided to order Duck fries and Quack and cheese. As soon as we sat down the waitress informed us that they are out of several dishes especially all the ones that contain duck (which is why we came there in the first place). 

I have never seen a restaurant with such high rating running out of key supplies (especially their main dish) - Just bad management. They had every opportunity to inform me regarding the mess they were in that day when I called earlier. Both the times I visited them, I was taking my wife out. Both the times I arranged babysitters to make it happen. Really mad that I could not have the time with my wife like I desired to have.

Running a restaurant is not all about having one great chef; the presentation matters, the surrounding matters, customer service matters. They need to operate as a well oiled machine to deserve higher rating. 

We settled for their signature burgers which was good.... and so the one star.

We were seated promptly and Yuli our server was awesome.  We sat at the Chef's Table - or rather marble counter - was and is the best seat in the house; at least for us. We started with some great cocktails and some amazing large popover- gougères  was the house bread.  for my courses; I had the potato ceviche, clams and bucatini, the NY strip and the caramel coffee cake with coffee ice cream.  My dining partner had the foie gras soup (AH-MAY-ZING!), the octopus, NY strip and the cheese plate.  We finished with sherry, ruby port and coffee.  I loved every dish I had and tasted all of the other ones as well - and they were all very good.  This is not food for the spice-weak or wary.  Great savory, spicy, bold flavors but nothing overpowering that lingered.  Great pops of flavor that quickly dissipated to allow you to enjoy the next set of flavors and textures.
Chef Sbraga was to our left all night and very attentive to every dish that went out to every diner.  He came over to wish my dining partner a happy birthday and we were also given a little birthday goodie bag with a copy of the night's menu and a handmade treat from Chef Sbraga.
The four course menu for $49 is definitely reasonable for the food that you get, although my dining partner felt the $15 extra upcharge for the NY Strip should have equated to a larger portion, but we didn't leave hungry.

Damn you Jose Garces for spoiling my tongue like this.  From this point on, I will rate burgers based on the Garces scale.  You win Iron Chef Garces.  Bobby Flay needs to visit this place, tastes these burgers, study these burgers, and redeem himself for the crap he puts out in West Philly.  I went to ""Bobby's Burger Palace"" a few days before Village Whiskey, and it was absolute garbage.  Bobby Flay...iron chef?  Are you kidding me?  No wonder Bourdain has a thing against celebrity chefs.  After writing this review, I'm going to update my review of Flay's burger joint by changing the two Yelp stars to one.  Why?  Because, now I'm on the Garces scale.  There is a reason why Garces beat Flay on an episode of Iron Chef.  If you visit Village Whiskey, you will taste that reason.

Food (10/10) = We ordered the following:

1) Village Burger = For the third time, this is the best burger I've had so far in my life!  8 ounces of juicy, succulent medium rare beef, married to a sesame roll accompanied with Boston bibb, and house-made thousand island dressing.  Added on the rogue smokey blue, and caramelized onions.  I regret not throwing on some smoked bacon and a fried egg, after witnessing how beautiful those things look on other diners' burgers.

2) Herbed Cherry Tomatoes = Great appetizer served with black olive tamponade, whipped ricotta, and toasted sourdough.  A gush of flavor from the tomatoes just explodes in your mouth.    

3) Duck Fat French Fries = WTF man?!  So good....sooooo goooooooooood.  I want to bathe in a pool of duck fat.

4) Sixpoint Rye = Great beer, with some spice.  This was suggested by our waitress...forgot her name.

Ambiance (10/10) = A really nice set up.  A great bar.  It has a tavern feel to it.  Unfortunately, I can't remember too much because my full attention was to the food.  

Service (9.0/10) = Great service, waitress was attentive and gave a great suggestion for beer.  

Overall Opinion = One more time just in case you didn't get it the first 3 times -- Best burger I've had so far in my life.  If you are visiting Philly, you need to check this place out before you leave.  The next time I'm in Philly, this will be on the to do list.  If I lived in Philly, this restaurant would be a regular routine for me.

I ordered the sauteed brussel sprouts with garlic and olive oil, and beets made with orange juice and parsley, a chilled dish. These were both amazing! I would go back for these two sides alone if they were being served again.

While the name got my attention, the menu is what got us inside. Having been from New Orleans, seeing their menu featuring things such as Po Boys, Red Beans and Rice, and Beignets was enough to grab my attention. 

Inside it was a fairly nice, albeit small, place. The size is not detrimental, as a lot of places in this area are on the smaller side. The bar was crowded with limited seating, but they were quick to get a table for us. 

The draft beer list is fairly good, with a variety of local beers and classic beers you expect to see at a bar in the city. Where this place stood out was on their bottle list, featuring beers from England, France, Canada, and many other countries. The beers featured were of a wide variety of styles and percentages, and they even had trappist rochefort 8, a favorite of mine.

The food menu was concise and featured classic New Orleans favorite foods. I got a roast beef Po Boy which was fairly large and came with a side of my choice (I chose the baked mac and cheese). The Po Boy was not overflowing with roast beef and gravy as you'd expect in New Orleans, but instead was a more manageable size that required less napkins while still being absolutely delicious.

The baked mac and cheese, while insanely hot, was equally delicious. The cheese was perfectly creamy while the top of the pasta was baked to a nice golden crisp. 

The waitress I had was great; she was quick to answer questions about the menu and the origins/history of the restaurant, and engaged in a nice conversation about New Orleans culture. The service from her, and whoever delivered our drinks, was prompt and well-mannered. 

I heard good things from the resident muffaletta expert at the table, and nothing bad was said about the surf-n-turf Po Boy either (breaded shrimp with roast beef). The waitress said their weekend brunch featuring beignets and cafe au lait was something to come back for and I believe her, as this place was a great find. 

I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to try a nice foreign bottled beer alongside some great, classic, and authentic food from the South!",2013-10-07 23:44:49,"{'food': ['Po Boys', 'Red Beans and Rice', 'Beignets'], 'drink': ['Draft beer', 'Bottled beer']}"

I couldn't find it, thinking it was higher in the numbers than it actually was, but stumbled upon it again after like a month, and have gone with friends and co-workers alike.

THE LAYOUT:
It's got a good amount of seating, decor is very cafe-ish, as if the place was some kind of fancy eatery in a past life.  It is pretty fancy pants as far as pizza joints go, as Marcello points out, but its no Primavera or something super fancy.

THE PIZZA:
I personally think they would do well to put more pizzas by slice out behind the counter, their variety isn't very striking.  I usually get some kind of pizza with meat on it, I have tried the cheesesteak pizza (because I love that kind of stuff), and it was pretty good...I wouldn't want it as a cheesesteak, but it actually does well on a slice of pizza dough.  Prices are average, nothing special.

THE SERVICE:
I think this is how more pizza joints should operate.  Anyone who has read my reviews before has probably noticed by big pet-peave with trying to call out peoples orders for them to pick up from the counter...I don't know what's worse, the obnoxious workers' screaming or the hopeless tards who can't seem to figure out that the slice of meatlovers they literally just paid for belongs to them.  I only suffer that for good food, and I wouldn't suffer it for this place, so they do well to use a number system, where your food is brought to your table.  This makes the environment much more relaxed and quiet.

THE VERDICT:
It's good pizza, the place is clean and quiet, but there really isn't anything to knock your socks off.  Great place to go to every once in a while, but I don't see how someone could make this their main pizza joint.",2008-05-22 19:03:20,"{'food': ['pizza', 'cheesesteak pizza'], 'drink': []}"

This place deserves a SOLID five star review. The food is spectacular. I had never tried Cambodian food but found the spice blends to be EXTREMELY agreeable and complimentary to the meats and veggies they were cooked with. Get the meatballs. Wrap them in lettuce and dip them in the spicy sweet sauce. Get the caramelized pork in coconut. Get the 4 mushroom lemon grass pork in the banana leaf. The only reason I would NOT reorder these items is to try the rest of the menu. I want everything. Byob (though we didn't last night, couldn't find a liquor store) is a nice option, and the family that owns Khmer is SO accommodating and cool. I expected Khmer to be sort of a hole in the wall, due to the lack of any Yelp interior pictures, but I actually found it to be very cute. I caaaaan't wait to go back.

Locals will remember past culinary iterations in this space that were just meh.
For starters, the space is handsome but with some kitschy touches that will wear thin over time.  Whetstone has the look of a first post-grad project conceived by a marketing/restaurant design major.
The bar is smaller now when compared to the prior tenant's design, and this is because of the addition of a crudo/cheese station.  This concept is a culinary peeve for me, since ANYONE can pull together an excellent crudo/cheese plate at home for a fraction of the cost.  You can, Blanche.  You can.  

Moving along.

A particular aspect about this place that the current and previous owners keep failing to address is the lack of noise-abating construction materials.  At points, it was too loud with the place only half full.  A particularly chatty threesome ten feet away really drove that point home. 

This city is full of trendy places like this, and Whetstone, like all the rest, unfortunately fails to take the extra steps to create a marginally more quiet dining experience.  Skip this place on weekends if you hate the din as much as I do.

Onward.

My partner had the Caesar Salad, and I had the Whetstone salad, both of which were plentiful and quite good.  Only complaint is that the croutons in both were well past their prime and inedible.  Zero crunch.  Tough as licorice.
My partner had the seared Icelandic cod with clams (6 oz if that matters to you...), and he said it was a four-star dish.
On to my burger, listed as 'Dad's Burger' on the menu.  It was offered as a single patty (about 4-5 oz according to our server), or double patty (about $3 more) of La Frieda beef, which is a well-regarded meat purveyor.
Ok.  I get it.   Americans frequently ruin hamburgers by mashing the heck out of them with a spatula on a barbecue.  And yes, fattier is tastier, and cooking over a barbecue grill unfortunately lets all that unctuous goodness drip through the grill into oblivion.
However, the Dad's Burger, in spite of its carnal pedigree, was just plain drippy bovine bloviation that overwhelmed the meager bun and made me pine for the much-lauded burger at Rouge on Rittenhouse.  
Whatever toppings were on the Dad's Burger just got lost in the muck.  We all know that a proper burger is a thick, gently packed thing of beauty with some juice in evidence.  Not here, however.
I opted for the fries (half salad is also offered), which were just too friggin' salty.  Oversalting is a given here, as much as anywhere else, so no surprise.
I may give Whetstone another try, but there is nothing new going on here.",2015-08-02 03:44:21,

While he's clearly a very enthusiastic person, this was far from a real culinary tour. Instead, this was more like an opportunity for Chef Poon to talk about himself and to boast about his accomplishments and life story. Chef Poon has evidently had a successful career, but many of the things he said were difficult to believe, at best. Furthermore, it seemed impossible for him to talk about the virtues of his cooking and his life philosophy without criticizing the cooking and philosophy of others. I found that negative and unnecessary. When he could sense that members of the group were not buying everything he was saying or were more interested in looking around, he was rather rude and critical of those people. His remarks were couched in humor, but they were inappropriate and took away from the experience. I found the assumptions he made about people (that all Americans are rich and have never had to work for anything and are lazy) and their interests (that women would want to hear about herbs/spices that have been traditionally used for abortions) to be absolutely ridiculous and offensive. Finally, the meal served at the end of the tour by this chef, who suggested he had recently been visited by 15 of the top chefs in the country, served sweet and sour chicken with rice and a salad -- hardly inventive cuisine.

A few of us got together for a nice cultural evening at the opera and decided to do dinner beforehand. We decided on Village Whiskey as we are all seasoned whiskey sippers. I've heard the restaurant was good but man... Now, I won't call it a proper restaurant, nor will I call it a pub, but I will call it a great idea that has been executed with style, class, and gusto. It's a small spot a little wider than a narrow bar with some booths and some tables. Simple, clean, and it has elements of both new and old... But enough about that... On to the food.

When looking at the menu you almost think to yourself, hrmmm, this is a small menu. And you're right it is small. But the food isn't really the point, the whiskey is. Anyway, this small menu packs a pretty big punch. Since there were 4 of us we ordered a few things and shared. We had the deviled eggs, which would've made your Mennonite grandmother proud, the tater tots which were crunchy on the outside and buttery smooth on the inside, pickled artichokes with some toasted bread and the fried cheese puffs which hot damn... I want a platter next time. We all dug right in and were immediately impressed. The prices on these apps were incredible too. $3 each for most of these at a Garces restaurant??!? What!?! Sweet!

The whiskey. The menu was HUGE! Our server was knowledgeable and if we had questions about a particular whiskey she was happy to give a brief synopsis. The specialty drink menu was also a force to be reckoned with. I had an ""Old Fashioned"" that would have made my father proud. My buddy Mike had the APA which consists of a few awesome ingredients like hops infused vodka and egg whites. Sounds strange but tastes amazing. 

The main course - Because whiskey isn't dinner. I had the Village Burger. I am going to go ahead and rank this burger up there with some of the best burgers in the city. I ordered it medium and it came medium. Check! I topped it with bacon, gruyere cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavor of the fresh grass fed beef was incredible. My wife had the pulled pork and that too was incredible. The pork was nice and tender, juicy, and flavor packed. We split a side of the duck fat fries with the cheese sauce too. These fries are to die for.

In the end we left fat and happy. The awesome whiskey list had us buzzing and the great eats left us jolly. We waddled our way over to the opera and had a great night.

We told them we had a reservation and yet, about 5 minutes after we were seated, I received an email stating that my reservation had been canceled. 

The hostess was new and obviously did not think to ask if my mother, who was holding on to someone to walk from the moment we entered, could walk up a ton of stairs. I asked for a table that did not involve stairs and this completely flustered the hostess. The Red Owl is in a hotel so there are elevators, by the way. The hostess tried to seat us by the bar and it was so loud, even though the place was mostly empty, that my father asked about the elevators and if seating upstairs would be quieter. The hostess again became flustered and said it would be less noisy but she wasn't sure how to get upstairs. She then spent 5 minutes with us trailing behind her back and forth to get us to the elevator. I felt awkward and embarrassed for her and already wanted to leave. 

Upstairs was not quieter.  And they tried to sit us in a booth that was made for people smaller than average. I am not small, nor is my father, so I am not sure how they thought we were going to fit there. So we moved to a table. And then the service began.

Our waiter seemed annoyed with us, except for with my fiancé. Who wasn't paying. Is that snobby? Probably but it seemed like the waiter was being extra nice to my fiancé and ignored the rest of us. He spilled hot coffee on my father and did not even notice and then was sarcastically apologetic. He did get us a napkin with club soda on it, which was very nice.

The food was fine. But nothing to write home about. And the coffee was an atrocity.

Today was a new day.  I had some pretty tasty tacos, albeit not quite what I was hoping for. THE white sauce,  the creamy cilantro sauce that makes a fish taco a fish taco...not around. I feel like this place puts out a good product, but not the taste from back home. It tries to do too much. Just the white sauce and the cabbage man. Simple is good.

I also got a chicken taco that was pretty disappointing, using stewed chicken in place of pollo asado. Que lastima!

This place just tries too hard. Oh they have aquas frescas, but no horchata, no pina, no fresa. They do have jamaica and tamarind though which I didnt try. They did have a delicious Boylan soda fountain with a terrific cream soda, although I wish there was jarritos.

This simply was not the case. Blue Duck's food exceeded my already loft expectations. Pro tip- make reservations as this place is small. Now onto the food..
For starters we ordered the Confit Fries, Cantaloupe Soup, and the Potato Gnocchi. The Fries have been written about many times and yes they are that good. An absolute must to order. The gnocchi were in a red sauce with cubes of fresh mozzarella. They were like little happy puffy light clouds of pasta. Exquisite and refined, albeit a bit of a small portion. The surprise of the day was the Cantaloupe Soup. It included pineapple, mint, and chili oil. I am an adventurous eater, so I gave this a go. Wow! It awakened all of my senses. It was cool, sweet, pungent, spicy. This neat little dish was the winner of the night. If it is again on the menu, I implore you to try it. 
For the main course we ordered General Tso wings with Wasabi Blue Cheese. This was a solid dish that was heightened by the Wasabi mixture. I look forward to trying this as a dip the next time I have General Tso's. The other dish we ordered was Lobster Tacos. They included: strawberries, watermelon radish, red cabbage, topped with a vanilla vinaigrette. Quite an experimentive conglomeration of fruit and the sea. This dish  was interesting, but lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for. 
I simply could not pass on the Blood Orange Gelati with fresh whipped creme. This was the neat little bow on what was as close to perfect of an actual meal. The food and pairings are unrivaled in NE Philly and quite honestly, it is ONLY the ambiance that holds this place back from being talked about in the same breath as Vetri, Sbraga, etc. 
The interior decor is quite frankly a mess of non-symmetric dishes hung on the wall with lightbulbs hanging out the center. That it is in a strip mall is also disappointing. The sound level in the dining room was deafening. There was literally all walks of life as patrons. Punk/emo, first dates, mesh backed trucker hats, 40 somethings that brought Arbor Mist, etc. I don't want a dress code, but I also would prefer not to eat next to Marilyn Manson kids with huge holes in their ears. Crap, I am getting old. I almost wrote ""Get off my lawn"". 
To wrap things up, Blue Duck only misses 5 stars due to the ambiance. You go here for the food and endure the decor/patrons/sound level.

The service is friendly but not fast. After I sat at the bar, several bartenders saw me and continued to interact among themselves. I was about to leave when I was given a menu, so I ordered a beer and then some brunch.

It should not take 20 minutes to get a frittata, but when it arrived it was hot, so I put the delay down to the place being busy. It happens. Being steaming hot, however, was part of the problem - it was the asparagus frittata with salad, but the salad was served ON TOP, rendering it soggy from the steam from the eggs. It was sort of like when you order a takeout burger and fries and they put the fries in a styrofoam container with the hot meat. Limp. Worse, there was no point in putting the salad on top, as it added no flavor, and the frittata was so underseasoned (eggs with no salt or pepper?) that it just added to the overall blandness. It was, however, generously sized and the eggs were properly cooked, not rubbery at all. After removing the flaccid greens and salting and peppering it, it was pretty good.

Are disastrous ideas like this a product of the cooking show culture, where everyone is trying to make dishes creative without regard to conception or execution?

We then asked for an order of vegetable spring rolls. The spring rolls came on top of a bed of cucumbers so we politely reminded the waitress that our friend is deathly allergic to cucumbers. The waitress was clearly very angry and proceeded to yell at us saying we did not tell her that we did not want cucumbers.

I've tried a lot on the menu and some of my favorites are the tartare venezianna (served in these hearty-sized mason jars with crusty baquette slices) and the spicy ham pizza.  I have not tried the pepperonata but everyone raves about it so I will report back! Other pizza favorites are the Cippolini and the Pepperoni. 

Sangrias as tasty, I know because I became a favorite of our server on my last visit and had carafes of all three: red, white and green. (Don't judge me, it was a rough work week.)  The red was my fav and the green was different but better suited for one refreshing glass. 

The atmosphere is what I love most. The juxtaposition of the plants and potted flowers surrounding the outside tables with the bridge towering directly above and the whiz of the cars and bikes zipping by on Kelly Drive...(sigh.) It makes this city girl happy. 

A few small but noteworthy perks: crunchy chick pea/pistachio mixture toasted up and served in little bowls upon arrival. 

Little bar but fun to sit at if you are in the mood for a quick drink, or three. They do have happy hour, so keep that in mind as you East Fallers are deciding between the the two other places you know you fall back on. :)

Bathrooms are clean! Go downstairs and on your way you'll see a huge subway car window displayed. Pretty cool.

Entrees are a pretty appropriate meal size. Lots of seasoning in all their food.

We also got a flan which was a little different than regular flan--- they tell you the syrup is bittersweet. More bitter than sweet. It is a genuine burnt taste of caramel sauce. Not my fave.

We also tried their Vampira beverage... a bizarre take on the tequila bloody mary that we decided was good. It tastes like they added worcester shire sauce or something... it reminds me of venison marinade. You might want to get one to share with someone to try it.

Service was sort of awkward. And it's cold in there in the wintertime, so of course they put you next to the window. Just ask to move, they understand. Asking for personal opinions helps the staff warm up to you, instead of seeming dissatisfied with their job. A bit slow, though.

First time I went, I made the mistake of showing up on a Sunday without a reservation. Absolutely DO NOT DO THIS. In fact, to save yourself time and frustration, just make a reservation whatever day and time you are thinking of going. The place is super small and you're not going to want to wait outside. 

That being said, when you do make a reservation, they are READY FOR YOU. I can't tell you how many times I've made a reservation at other places and was still made to wait.

Now the food. FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC. Whether you are going for brunch or dinner, you are in for a complete awesome and different experience. Normally I have a hard time picking things on a menu because it's so damn boring. I always try to order something new. Here I just have a hard time choosing because the everything on the menu sounds so good, and it's stuff you won't find somewhere else.

Burgers? Amazing. So far we've tried the Pork Roll Burger, which totally lives up to its reputation. My friend also had the Beast of the Northeast, which unfortunately was just a limited time thing, but they really should put it back on the menu because of how much he, and everyone else that has had it had reacted. 

Wings? Also great.

Fries? Holy crap the fries. It may sound silly, but the fries they have here are incredible. All varieties I have tried. If they did takeout, I would be coming at least once a week to pick up just some of those alone. If you ever see they are making bacon, egg, and cheese waffle fries for brunch, GO. 

The staff is so, so nice. The owners and management have everything set up perfectly here.

My only super tiny complaints are the size of the place, and the noise level. It is REALLY small in there. Probably for the best though. If they served a much larger crowd, I'd worry that the quality would suffer. With it being so small, it is incredibly loud! You won't really be able to hear the people you are there eating with.

When you first step your foot inside the restaurant, you'll smell that cheesy smell and will know, Ralphs is real Italian. I sat down, got greeted nicely with our waiter who seemed to kind of rush us in the beginning but he go better throughout the time. First of all, the bread they give you is wow. Just a simple bread but soft in the inside and crispy crusts on the out. LOVED.

 I was craving two things this night. Gnocchi and pasta with vodka sauce. I decide to be adventurous and ended up ordering the Spinach Gorgonzola  Gnocchi. I was grossed out when I first got the plate because the green spinach gnocchi look like cocoons..like literally... haha But the flavor is full of spinach of tastes really ""green"". The gnocchi is very dense with he spinach flavor and so if you like that , you'll love this dish. The gorgonzola sauce is not too heavy and balances greatly with the gnocchi. 

Portions are good. Price is not too pricey. Has a great selection of wine. The servers know what real authentic food id supposed to be like.

Four of us (foolishly) attempted to get into Village Whiskey on a Friday night and the wait was two hours.  I'm sorry, but I won't wait two hours for a table in any restaurant in a city with so much great food.  I would suggest trying a weeknight or lunch as they seemed to be much more reasonable. Two of us tried again on a Wednesday night and had to wait about 40mins.  We ducked around the corner to Rum Bar for a drink while we waited, so not a huge inconvenience.

Before I say anything else - the food was super delicious, there is no question about that.  My burger was cooked perfectly; juicy, flavorful, meat heaven.  We got the duck fat fries with cheese sauce and so should you.  Cheese puffs were good, but not as good as our other choices.

My biggest beef (ha) with this place is the prices.  $11 for a burger isn't expensive, but it only comes with lettuce and thousand island dressing.  All of the extra toppings, including cheese, are $1.50-$5.50.  Whoa.  On the other side of that, the whiskey menu is even worse.  $10 for two ounces of regular Jameson?  I can go buy a whole bottle for $30.  We each had a cocktail and a beer, but I couldn't justify getting any WHISKEY at Village WHISKEY.  This made me sad.  As an Irish girl, I love whiskey, and looking at that untouchable, glorious menu of brown ambrosia hurt my heart.

Note: I will admit that I am spoiled by living in South Philly.  There are so many great restaurants and bars to choose from and everything is much cheaper.  I know that Center City prices need to be higher because of high overhead costs, but in this case, I think Garces is pushing it.

During the summer, I tried the ""mini Rouge burger"" for the first time with some co-workers. Although not entirely like the Rouge, the 500 Degrees burger was the next best thing. I deemed it one of the best, if not the best fast food burger I have ever tried; better than Five Guys and even better than In-N-Out. If I wrote the review back then, it would probably be 4/5.

But, that was then. What happened? Did they change chefs/owners/something? I ordered the Classic Combo with truffle fries and the strawberry milkshake, while my lady got the burger of the week with the fried egg. We waited anxiously around 10 minutes and our number was called. We prepare to unravel the anticipated greatness to come, and BAM. Did I just get Punk'd? 

Everyone take a look at the photos that other Yelpers have submitted. Beautiful little thing, isn't it? This night, not so much! My burger was sloppily put together. The bun was squished and not at all like the glossy and puffy bun I remembered. Bad start so far, and it does not get better since they messed up my order and replaced my mushrooms with cooked red onions. After removing that, I took a huge bite to feed my burning appetite. Meh. I ordered medium rare and it came out medium to medium well. I remember the burger oozing its glorious juices all over my arm after the first bite. This was just a disgrace.

Her burger was not much better either. The burger was also put together like the McDonald's down the street from me, nasty. The egg had already popped and left a watery mess. She didn't even finish the burger. That doesn't make me feel too proud after talking up the 500 Degrees burger for so long.

The ""truffle"" fries barely tasted like truffles. It actually tasted normal, but was decent. It could have been a bit crunchier, since I hate limp fries. 

The milkshake was the highlight of our meal, but then again, who messes up a milkshake?

To no avail. We did get a person on the line at our 5th or so try, but she hung up on us before we could even say hello. 

After a few more tries, we finally got through to a person/voice. I asked if I could order takeout and was told 'hang on a minute' and was transferred to another person (maybe someone who spoke english?). She told us they were closed. I asked when they opened and she said 'i don't know'. I asked if they would be open at all today and she said 'i don't know'. i started asking another question and she hung up abruptly mid-sentence.

I have no idea why this went down the way it did, but it sure dampened my enthusiasm for trying the food. After this 'experience'/treatment it will take a lot for us to try Teresita again. Especially given all the other incredibly delicious mexican restaurants in this area.",2014-12-19 16:32:14,"{'food': ['Mexican food'], 'drink': []}"

Fried green tea ice cream
Green tea ice cream

They were all great, although over time I realized I don't prefer colder sushi, so the Banzai tree roll was the least favorite of them all.

Wife and I went to LC for an early dinner last Saturday. I had bought the $20 for $10 deal, so when we got there and the waitress offered to make us Margharita's, I was all for driving two blocks and picking up a mid-level bottle! (after we ordered the apps)! 

The Mango Margaritas were very tasty. Out came our empanadas and Mole. I was surprised how small the empanadas were and there were only two (2). My wife and I both come from the food business and we have run restaurants and cafeteria's. We know it costs about 25-35 cents to make the empanadas and mole, and they were charging $7.50 for each dish! The food was Good I must say, but it did not knock our socks off. 

The pulled pork did not have enough Mexican spices in it, it kind of reminded us of bbq pulled pork. The seafood enchiladas were good, but for $18 bucks? They brought me out a side of hot sauce, complimented the food well.

When we got the bill I notices they had charged us $7.00 for the margarita mix, and $1.00 for the small side of hot sauce. I felt like I was being nickel and dimed and the prices were a little steep. I would like to try out other Mexican restaurants in area and then compare them to LC, but for now... only two stars for this one.
