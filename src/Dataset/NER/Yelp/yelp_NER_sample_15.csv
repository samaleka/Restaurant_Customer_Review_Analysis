That's what first caught my eye because it was a nice change from other places I frequent in the area. You can tell the guy in charge cares about the way it looks and feels inside. By the way when I talked to him later he mentioned how pleased he is to also have an open kitchen so that people could see exactly what was going on as their food was being prepared. I had the lamb meal with eggplant appetizer and it was really good. There was also a nice portion of pita bread. Although I enjoyed the meal, I think it was a little overpriced.  If it were the only lamb that good in the area, I'd consider paying those prices again, but it's not, so the price is a big 'con'.",2010-12-03 14:14:13,"{'food': ['lamb meal', 'eggplant appetizer', 'pita bread'], 'drink': []}"

RsZht8avafMlzgS1_5OgVQ,jXdkqjvAo_4ftyoU-IvMUg,MMRRS6YhVRx_iN5-JhMRYg,4,0,0,0,"I'm a big fan of this place, which is my go-to for no-holds-barred Chinese dinners in University City. Two things I've noticed about the 10+ times I've eaten here: (1) it's not as spicy as people make it sound at first and (2) I usually eat too much because the food is too good.

Most of the dishes here are hot and satisfying, and served in generous portions that are good for sharing. The formula for the dishes here seems to be one meat + one spice. I'm a particular fan of the cumin-style lamb, or anything dry-fried or cooked long hot pepper-style. If you want something more saucy (instead of dry-cooked), the crispy rice style is good, and comes with bamboo shoots and various mushrooms in a creamy sauce (not spicy). For a vegetable, I'd recommend the pea-leaves with garlic (also not spicy), which is simple and a nice break from the meats. Some purists may complain that the dishes aren't 100% authentic, but they're still really delicious and tastily seasoned. They also have some creative menu items, like the spicy hot pot and tea-smoked duck in beer sauce, which sound delicious, although I haven't tried them yet. In terms of appetizers, the spicy oil wontons and cold cucumbers are usually good starters.

The best way to experience this place is to come with a large group for dinner. If you have 8 or more people, you can also opt for the tasting menu at $25-35/person, where they'll serve a variety of appetizers and dishes to your preference/spice level, in family style (shared dishes). It's best to come hungry for this, because there will be a LOT of food, and it will be good. If you pick the higher price range they will sometimes also throw in some off-menu extras, like lobster. Definitely a recommended experience.

The servers here consistently do a good job of making you feel welcome and comfortable, especially if you come in a group, and they always explain what the dishes are before bringing them out. There is also always ample tea and rice to go with whatever delicious Han-concoction you're eating.

Though it's usually a dinner place, I've come here for a quick lunch once or twice. They have smaller dishes as well as beef noodle soup, which was decent.

The ambiance is a bit like Landmark Americana crossed with a contemporary art museum, but it still looks pretty cool. Everything in the restaurant is always spick and span. They also have charging stations for your phone!",2014-12-27 06:47:38,

Mel's is located in a small stand-alone building on Umbria St. Slightly dilapidated, it easily goes unnoticed unless you happen to know of it's existence (thanks to Yelp, of course). 

The first time I went was around 8 am. I seated myself at one of 3 open tables (4 in total) and Mel herself came over and poured me a cup of coffee in a brightly colored mug. That was the first moment I started to fall in love with this place: Mel doesn't use those miniature white coffee mugs you see in most diners - these mugs are huge and look like she took them right out of her own personal kitchen. 

The second thing that struck me was that there's Sriracha on every table. Mel's clearly knows the best breakfast condiment and doesn't make you request it.

Despite my love of Sriracha I was craving something sweet, so I ordered the French toast and bacon (extra crispy). The kitchen is in the same room as the dining area so I was able to watch Mel happily work away on my food while she cooked a few breakfast sandwiches for the customers sitting at the bar right in front of the griddle. Clearly those patrons were regulars as they chatted about their kids' little league and the scorching hot weather.

Soon my breakfast was delivered to me and oh my, was it delicious! The bacon was perfectly crispy and the French toast was delectable. The portion was quite large - 3 slices of toast and about 5 strips of bacon.

I think my bill was about $8. Of course I didn't notice the large sign stating they take credit card for bills over $10 - so I threw in a Mel's Kitchen t-shirt (which is a really cute play off of the Hell's Kitchen logo).

With all the thoughtful touches and Mel's down to earth, amiable personality I truly felt at home here. I've since been back for take out breakfast sandwiches and I continue to be impressed by the service and food quality. This is now my favorite no-frills breakfast spot.",2013-07-17 14:00:43,"{'food': ['French toast', 'bacon'], 'drink': []}"

The first was in 2015 for a fixed price tequila event (a different tequila was served with each course).  We were extremely happy with our meal, so we decided to go there for the first Restaurant Week of 2016. The server, Kate, was excellent.  She knew about all of the food and drinks on the menu, and she made recommendations to our table and other tables; she also checked with us frequently and made sure our water glasses were always filled.   [NOTE: Since it is Restaurant Week there is a special menu, so don't expect the full menu.]  We thought the food was only so-so this time.  The guacamole, as others have reported, is made to order (a card is placed on the table and you select how you want it made).  It is always the first course (whether or not it is Restaurant Week).  We would have preferred to have seen it made table-side, but it was good.

The next 3 courses were not very memorable.  My Caesar Asada was supposed to have grilled romaine, but it wasn't grilled, and the dressing was a little off.  My husband had Taquitos, which he said was fine but not anything to write home about.  For the main course I had the shrimp.  There were only 4 medium sized shrimp on the plate, and the menu said they would be adobo seared.  Instead the adobo was smeared on the plate.  I also think the shrimp was a bit under done.  There was a salad that was listed as an avocado salad, but it was more of a cilantro salad.  There was way too much cilantro, but there were 2 what they called fried sweet plantain cakes that were good.  My husband ordered the filet, and he noted that it was cooked really well, but the steak should not have been served over the rice because the red sauce complimented the steak but the crema did not.  He said he thought it was a clumsy presentation, but he would order it again, now that he knows how to put it together.

One other comment: we thought there should have been more spacing between the courses.  We were in and out in less than an hour, and the restaurant was not all that busy.  It wasn't like they needed our table.

Flavorful, tender - dishes that left you wanting more, even though you were full when finishing - just because it was THAT good! 
Only reason why I did not rate this a 5 is the noise. It was nearly impossible to hear due to how loud it was inside. Maybe the hardwood floor and practically bare walls just amplifies the talking. Our ears were ringing by the time we left. 
Would definitely return for brunch next time. And hopefully on an off-time when it's not crowded (less noisy).

I went here for restaurant week, and other than it's strange location, it got off to a good start and we were seated right away.  The decor might have been cool years ago, but the metal and neon lights were not relevant at all to the food or the setting. We asked the waitress for her suggestions, but she just said everything was good, even when asked to compare specific dishes (I like when the staff has had the food, and can give an opinion).  The couple cocktails I tried were good.

Meal started off with the mushroom soup and the escargot, both were really good and I liked that the escargot was served with mushrooms, it was a nice pairing.  I would recommend either dish depending on tastes. The bread and oil that was served with this course was very good, we got a second helping.

The main course was where the meal started to lose me a bit.  We had the duck and the scallops.  The duck was a bit on the dry side for me and the fat was not rendered enough, the lentils that it was served with were good, but not notable.  The scallops, while few, were good, but could have been seared a bit more, the farro ragout was not my favorite.

Had to wait a long time for the dessert, seems like a bunch of the chefs friends had arrived to stand at the awkward bar and he was out with them for 20 or 30 minutes.

It's a busy Sunday mid-morning so the place is busy busy. We wait for our table & when we finally sit we are greeted by our dud. ""Hi, can you get you started with something to drink."" We say, ""Yes, coffee please."" We wait. Dud comes back. ""Did you want anything to drink?"" We smile and say, ""Yeah, we're waiting for our..."" Dud interrupts, ""Coffee. Yes. Coming up."" 

We finally get our coffee & it's wonderful. Nice cup of dark rich La Columbe coffee. We tell our dud that we know what we want. He writes it down. Thank God. 

I ordered the Toad in a Hole which is an amazing new way to have eggs Benny. Basically it's a big piece of brioche toast dipped in hollandaise sauce, melted cheese & topped with w/ a perfectly poached egg. Amazing delicious! I got it with a side of potato latke & homemade apple sauce. Crazy good!

The bf ordered the country fried steak which he devoured & a side of the most amazing cheese grits I've had. The country fried steak came with a really beautiful & tasty biscuit. Not very flakey but so amazing. And they have homemade blueberry jam on the table to put on your toast or biscuit which is really good. Don't miss it. 

So our dud waiter actually took our order right & I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't until mid through my meal that I wanted more coffee. He never came by our table to see how we were or how the food was. We had to flag him down after he finally stopped flirting with another waitress he was fooling around with by their computer station. He came over & I told him I wanted more coffee. What a shock, dud forgot. We had to flag him down again. By the time he brought me a fresh pot of coffee I was done eating. I did enjoy my other cup of joe.

The restaurant, if you can call it that, for its food would be better served on Olympus than into mortal mouths, is inconspicuous. The strip mall in which the sandwichery is sandwiched includes benign places of commerce that will have no bearing on the implications of humanity except for that they have been built on the sidewalk on which this restaurant stands. Under the mounted plates and dimmed lights there are emptying bowls; all eyes are on the food and there are no frowns.

The Blue Duck is here.

Chapter 2

At first you think, ""mac and cheese - I can get that anywhere,"" and then you see the cranberries.

At first you think ""escargot - I don't want snail,"" and then you see the champagne butter.

The sandwiches - pork rolled, pounded with tastebud dynamite, and vulgarly acronymed - are cheaper than a Coney Island Corona. The Duck Fries are sleeping with melted Gouda. There's orange in the whipped cream.

After every bite, ecstasy; after every meal, sweatpants.

Chapter 3

When I was 12 a family friend took us to a Chinese restaurant in New York City that served such succulent soup dumplings that I vowed to return every time I ever visited Manhattan. The restaurant was my temple and turned their food into my salvation. I told everyone I would never need to eat at another restaurant ever again. Fifteen years later and I've been to 9 Pell Street in Chinatown almost 100 times. I am its pope and its owners and servers greet me with handshakes and desserts.

Forgive me Lord for I have sinned and been unfaithful.

What fellow Yelper Claude very accurately refers to as the ""mercurial"" nature of the owner of MexiCali has always been a bit of a challenge for MexiCali supporters like me, a die-hard since 2006. I thought the haters who complained about the odd hours, unexplained closings, weird menu strategies and so forth were just less interested in a great burrito than I was. I love a great burrito, and will put up with a lot to get it!

However, my most recent experience last week was just depressing. I was hoping for my old standby, a black bean burrito with plantains and guacamole. No more plain old black bean burrito on the menu, so I had to get a combination. No problem! Guacamole burrito it is. I even remember to say ""to stay"" before ordering to forestall that inevitable question. I get the bathroom key (locked to prevent non-paying customers from using it -- sort of understandable!) and read the proliferating signs about the salsa limits (take only a few! that means 2!). So far, only slightly annoying. 

Now, I knew we probably wouldn't be in for homemade tortillas. I've lived through several flip-flops in this policy -- once it was explained to me near the beginning of the school year that there are ""too many customers"" so they had to stop using homemade tortillas. Ok. No matter. But the burrito I got was nothing short of a travesty. Put together lumpily so that I started out with three or four bites of straight up rice, this was my first UN-toasted MexiCali burrito. Why oh why? The toasting was the best part! The cheese was cold, I tell you. Cold. Worst, the salsas were strange and watery -- the hot salsa's one attribute was wetness. I guess even with the strict two-salsa-per-customer limit the price of tomatoes and peppers is too high to make them taste like anything? 

I can't say I won't be back, because MexiCali is like that dreadful friend who nonetheless is incredibly fun two or three times a year.

With so many suitors how would she ever find her Grilled charming? By meeting Mr. Village Whisky, of course. 

His bloodline proven by Garces successes, she walked into what she thought would be her palace only to find a New York Studio sized restaurant. But... good things come in small packages, right?

Unfortunately, this fairytale doesn't end happily ever after. The princess felt that the price of love was too high, the service sparse and the food kinda meh.  

While our water glass was filled every 2 minutes, our server took ample time in checking in with us with about a half full restaurant and when we asked for my ketchup for the fries, that took another five minutes. 

Bottom line - if you're going to do a restaurant that takes a common food to the next level, TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. Everything that came out on our plates was lackluster. The fries while tasty were disappointing because I think we got a total of three for $5.  Same for the truffled mushrooms! If you're going to charge $5.50 for truffled mushrooms, make them irresistible.  I don't have problem paying for a unique food experience. 

I also did the Fanney Bay raw oysters that were pretty spectacular, but my last one was not cleaned properly and there was grit in it! $3.50 per oyster and they were not properly cleaned. 

I've been to Garces' restaurants many times and I am usually delighted over the design, food and service, but this was not one of those moments. I did not ride off into the sunset with my Grilled charming... I was left staring at a frog wondering if I ever have to kiss him again.

The quick summary.
Service is all but non existent.
Food is about a 4 out of 10. I'm being kind.
Value NONE....This is a waste of your time and money. This can be your next bad experience.
Management/Owners Adversarial and Rude, Badgering and condescending at best.  

This is probably my last visit there.  This WAS a great place, it is not any longer. It's sad to see a once place that was fantastic turn into slop through. But it has.  Save you time and effort.

What made bad, you might ask. Well here is my blow by blow accounting of this last experience.

Should have left when we pulled up and we could hear the excessively loud rave night club music was playing. As we entered you could feel the beat pulsing through your body. And the so called chefs are acting like D. J.s at the same club. 

But since we are meeting up with family, and  we had reservations, we decide to endure further. You do this type of thing for so you can spend time with family. So....

THEY HAVE achieved a level of incompetence when selecting a table for our party of FIVE.  THEY tried to cram us onto a table barely meant for three skinny people. When asked about it , the staff seemed to confused and frozen on what to do. Eventually THEY manage to put us with a table to share with a group of six. So now we have six strangers at the same table with us.  The strangers were cool about it.

After about 20 minutes of being ignored.  Finally someone drops off some water, says they are here to serve us.  (Service was so slow and absent, we all felt very ignored.). Asked for coffee and eventually we ended with a half cup that that had that nasty several hours old and oily uncleaned coffee pot taste and film. Not a good start.  It's definitely the first sign of a business lowering the quality of its products.

I think we were all disappointed on one level or another.  It was a pathetic showing by the blue duck. The bug that ran across the table impressed no one. The dick fries were so overcooked the were almost burned.  I ordered something called the remedy,  What was supposed to be a breakfast sandwich, turned out to be something that immediately of a used feminine napkin that was having huge infectious issues.  It was so disgusting, I took most of my will power not to have done the eruptus maximus Technicolor spray.  Seriously it was that gross.  

The wait staff kept avoiding talking to me as they saw the vile mess in front of me. And they could see I was clearly unimpressed. 

So finally every choked down what they ordered.  Again more amateur grade food given. 

When it came time to leave and pay the check, suddenly someone became interested in my issue. Only to experience the lack of professionalism and care owners have.  I found myself being treated like I was in a criminal being interrogated.  Demanding answers.  If you serve things that look like SHIT, you can't expect people to try it.  I had no interest in tasting an infection infested anything.

Gennaro's is owned by the same people who own Lombardi's Pizza in New York - reputedly America's first pizzeria.  So they know a thing or two about pizza.  Their signature tomato pie is thin crust with San Marzano tomatoes and whole-milk mozzarella.  It was good but I do have to say probably not at the very top of pizzas I've ever eaten in Philadelphia or elsewhere.  A house salad with vinaigrette was large if not memorable but the pineapple cheese mouse pie for desert was totally tasty.  The restaurant is filled with retro items and posters from the 1940's making for a cool atmosphere.  

Special note - I was here during Restaurant Week and one person - Christine - worked the entire dining room.  She greeted people, answered the phone, waitressed, bussed, opened wine bottles, rearranged tables to accommodate large parties, took care of take-out orders ... and amazingly was efficient and friendly while multi-tasking as much as I have ever seen someone in the front of the house in a restaurant do.  She should get double or triple pay for her hard-working performance which was actually fun to watch.

Federal Donuts joins that small list of places where the food matches its expectations.  This small corner-sized store owned by Michael Solomonov (Zahav, Percy St BBQ, Bodhi Coffee), is the latest addition to a series of local eateries that challenges the restaurant empires built by Stephen Starr and Jose Garces.

We went on a Sunday morning around 1230.  There were no lines, and there was plenty of the famous chicken available.  The BF and I split a vanilla lavender donut and a pomegranate nutella donut.  I got a half order of the Harissa Chicken, and he opted for the Chili Garlic.  We also got coffee, therefore trying each of the menu's three featured items: donuts, chicken, and coffee.

This was my first dish, and I was afraid the whole meal was going to be just as bad.  Also, after I was finished, the waiter didn't give me a new plate, so the residue of the Dan Dan seasoned the rest of my meal.

Tofu Dry Pot: Pretty good.  It wasn't ""dry,"" though, at least not in the usual sense of the word.  It was a little oilier than I like but still tasty.  Although the spice level is 10, it was manageable.  Another problem was -- and I've never said this before -- the dish had too much tofu.  I would have liked to have a greater proportion of vegetables.  Nonetheless, I still liked it.

Tofu Cumin: This was the star of the meal.  It was very good and appropriately filled with cumin flavor.  I would definitely order this again.  The bad part was that the tofu was fried a little too much, and (like the Tofu Dry Pot) the ratio of tofu to vegetables was off.",2014-12-05 14:05:10,"{'food': ['Green Tea', 'Tofu Dry Pot', 'Tofu Cumin'], 'drink': []}"

Got my steak and jumped in head first! The place is super clean and refreshingly new as they've only been at it for about 3 years. The combination of meat, cheese, onion & fresh bread was the best in all of Philly! 

So, back to the competitors t-shirt....Little did I know, seated right next to me, playing a game of cards with his pal, in true South Philly style, was the owner Mark who heard me say, ""I'll change my shirt right now if they have one for sale!""  Thats how impressed i was with the food. 

After we met and shook hands, he offered to go get a few shirts at his nearby office for myself and my friend. By the time our meal was over, a nice gentlemen had gone and brought back two shirts for us at no charge!!!

The atmosphere is 'tight'... it's close quarters sitting inside. You have 'to get in where you fit in', as far as the inside seating goes.  Seating is filled in at the larger tables where there's space. I have yet to sit outside.  Though it's a smaller spot, the vibe is very chill. You'll see couples with young children, couples out on a casual date to groups of friends probably coming through to eat before really 'going out'.
Both times I sat right up at the counter where they make the pizzas. Being the talkative type, I was able to ask questions to the fellas making the pizzas about which ones they were making at that moment.  It helped with making our decisions as to what to eat.
The Renato pizza is my fav.. surprisingly since this is a meatless pie (I love a sausage slice of pizza)...  The Salsiccia is a very close second choice.  The pizzas are 'compact' but are shareable.. you don't have to wait long for all this pizza goodness to arrive at your table. Or in my case, the counter!  If hip hop... classic hip hop... is your thing, along with eating something better than an 'ordinary' slice of cheese pizza...this honestly may be the place for you!  I know I was in heaven.. eating awesome artisan pizza, head nodding to classic hip hop songs in the background.  Oh. and let me not forget, you can order a beer or wine with your pizza too..

Instead of elegantly peregrinating into a darkly lit steakhouse environment with velvet booths and leather menus, you classically saunter into a a rustic-meets-modern couture. Sure there are tiny flickering candles alight on your table, and sure the booth is as comfortable as any Ethan Allen leather couch, but there's an open kitchen and a smattering of steel lines to remind you that it's 2012, not 1912.

Your meal will commence with a menu from which you are obliged to choose one item from each of three courses (and a roll that's a cross between a puff-pastry and a traditional dinner roll. Practically hollow on the inside, it's filling enough for carb aficionados but pleasing enough for Atkins lovers alike.) But for all of my dear prix-fixe fearing friends (myself included) the options are bountiful. 

For your first course, if you're weary of foie gras (though I've heard the soup is fantastic), try the salmon and frozen yogurt. The plate is food gastronomy 900 - the yogurt is yogurt, not soft serve, and its tanginess pairs succulently with oily strips of raw salmon, which melt over your tongue and spill down your throat.

Next, try the fried loberster. Yes there's a nominal supplemental fee, but it's well worth the extra coins. No this isn't your typical lobster tempura - it's a complete lobster tail meat breaded and fried in something akin to the offspring of tempura and beer batter but golden, more smooth, more crisp and less greasy. The lobster swims on a sauce of green pesto and a mayonnaise like sauce - delicious enough to scoop with your bread should you have any left.

Finally, the BBQ chicken would leave an Kansan or Carolinian pleased. It's moist, juicy and marinated just enough such that the sauce neither overwhelms nor crusts on the meat. The onion rings accompanying the cole slaw are brilliantly battered - golden, crisp and without a drip of grease. 

For dessert, opt for the mascarpone - a fluffy mildly sweet cheese sitting atop a mountain of chocolate cookie crumble and laying next to a coffee granita so smooth it could almost be italian ice, there's certain no dessert more heavenly.

...

And two notes about the service: if your first taste of wine is too dry and sour, and your second swig of another wine leaves your tastebuds crying with an insulin rush, your waiter will happily uncork another bottle of another wine, this one just right. 

If your risotto with snails isn't as creamy as you'd prefer and is slightly too salty, fear not. The manager so kindly provided a delicious lamb dish as a complimentary substitute.

I would like to start off that the services at this bar is below average at best. I'll give you my 3 reasons on to why I gave this a low rating.

1.) We had a family event for my cousins birthday and we all put in food orders. Well I put in an order for a pitcher of beer. We had to wait 30 minutes before the pitcher was even brought out to our table and the waitress did not offer any apology or reason to why there was such a delay.

2.) The day we attended the bar it was actually NFL Sunday opening weekend. I simply asked the waitress for the wifi password as most bars have on for customers. She proceeded to give me the wrong information and i asked for assistance. She told me "" too bad"" and walked away. We had to reach out to a completely different waitress who gave us completely different credentials for the wifi. (The correct credentials I might add) 

3.) As the night was winding down my cousin wanted to get a shot. She wanted a Cinnamon Toast crunch for the both of us. We simply asked the bar tender for the shot. He responded by saying he does not know what that is and refused to make a shot for us. (He was very rude and just turned around to assist someone else after saying this)  It wasn't until we were about to walk out that he asked his buddy what the shot was and how to ring it up. He did not apologize, he simply just grabbed the necessary ingredients for the shot. I advised him that we would not be taking the shot and proceeded to walk out. On a related note most bars know what this shot is and any bartender she be knowledgeable when it comes to what shots are popular. So this may be an example of how unqualified for the position this bartender actually is.

In closing, I simply won't be going back to this bar, as there are many other local options available. The staff is disrespectful, is not knowledgeable, and service is slow.",2014-09-17 10:20:43,"{'food': [], 'drink': ['pitcher of beer', 'Cinnamon Toast crunch']}"

BUT, I ordered a delivery pizza in the summer (pizza + salad) and was overcharged. I only live about 8 blocks away, but it was a lazy hangover morning, and we just wanted a meal delivered. We didn't hear the phone when the delivery guy called the first time.. by the time I realized it he was gone back to the store. I called and he agreed to bring it back over (seriously, it really is about 8 blocks away). I gave him a BIG tip for coming back, reheated and ate my pizza, and forgot about it.

Later I see that there is a $95 charge on my credit card. My credit card company called the store and spoke with the owner (I was on the line too) and he maintained that I had ordered 3 pizzas, a salad, and a drink, and that the charge was justified. They refused to reverse it.

It was a good thing that I booked a table for 2 on opentable, because the place seemed pretty packed when we got there.

Being obsessive Yelpers, we both checked out other people's reviews beforehand and had a pretty good idea of what we wanted. My friend got the shashuka and added sausage to it, he seemed to enjoy it very much and used up the bread to mop up all the sauce! 

I got the Cyprus breakfast - two fried eggs, one fried to runny perfection while the other was a little over fried and the yolk was unfortunately hard. The eggs went well with the bread provided, which was hearty and crusty and absorbed the runny yolk well. The breakfast also came with a thick chunk of ham and two pieces of haloumi. While the ham was savory and grilled well, I thought the haloumi was a tad bit salty for my liking. I did enjoy the texture though - the exterior was crispy but the haloumi was still firm inside. 

I would recommend Kanella for the ambiance, it was a cute place and offers you a little slice of Mediterranean life. Great if you want to escape Philly for a bit!",2014-10-31 04:22:25,"{'food': ['shashuka', 'fried eggs', 'ham', 'haloumi'], 'drink': []}"

GOOD
---------------------------

Branding/Hype:
- Whoever did their branding successfully aped the high-class/retro-sheik look that nearly every restaurant in New York has been doing for the past eight years.  The menu and interior design were all well thought out and on-brand.

Staff:
- The staff were helpful and attractive and kind.

---------------------------
NOT GOOD
---------------------------

Burger Value:  
- Where do I start here?  $12 for a burger isn't unheard of.  But for $12 I expect it to come with some fries/a salad and also be an extremely good burger.  A $12 burger here is served all alone and by the time you spend an additional $2.5 for a single slice of cheese and $1.5 for onions, you are looking at one of the most overpriced burgers I've ever had.  Don't get me wrong: it was a great burger, but not much better than places like du-mont (though their burgers are also overrated) or even shake shack across the street.

Whiskey Selection:
- You would think that this would be the one thing they couldn't mess up.  They advertise over 100+ whiskeys so how could you go wrong?  You stock your bar with the most vanilla and uninspired whiskeys available.  I used to write about whiskey and take it pretty seriously so maybe I'm a unique case here, but part of the fun of going to a whiskey bar ought to be a special selection of whiskeys that you haven't heard of or tried before.  Almost nothing on the lengthy whiskey list couldn't have been purchased at a well stocked local liquor store.  With so much exciting stuff going on in small batch/local/independent distilleries in this country and around the world, it was a shame to see an enormous list with 5+ kinds of jack daniels (yuck) and the same scotches that nearly every other bar in the world has.  Oh and the whiskey was also overpriced ($13 for a makers mark?).  I'm told there are a few well curated whiskey bars in this city but I've not checked them out yet.  You can always get on a bus and go to Noormans Kil or The Post Office Bar in Brooklyn?

Beer Situation:
- Back to value, again.  I ordered a beer because there was nothing on their whiskey list that interested me.  Sadly, when you order a beer on tap at this place it is not served in a pint glass or even the 'american pint glass' (usually slightly less than in the UK or elsewhere) that every other bar everywhere uses when you order a beer on tap.  Here, you get a 12 oz fun-size glass.  And we're talking about a middle of the road IPA here, it wasn't a high-alcohol content microbrew or anything which could come in something as small as a cocktail glass and be okay.  I asked the server if I ordered another beer could I please have it in a 'big boy glass' and he informed me that if I ordered 'beer x' (i don't remember the name) that it would come in a larger pint glass.  Sure enough when he returns he hands me a skinny and mile-high pilsner glass that held even less fluid (i poured it into the initial glass with room to spare).

---------------------------
TLDR
---------------------------
- The burger was delicious but overrated.  Horrible value all around.  You can get a beer and a burger that's nearly as good for considerably less money at shake shack across the street.

I thought the food was incredible, but others at the table weren't as pleased. The BBQ was incredible, full of flavor, but also full of fat. The fat wasn't trimmed before serving, which is okay, if I could have seen the fat. The lighting in this place was awful. I had to use my cell phone to read the menu. The street lighting was better than the inside lighting, so grab a table by the window. 

Order food items separately, the platters seemed way overpriced. The brisket, sausage, and pork were excellent. Individual items were priced so low, but the portions were perfect. Order a side to complete your meal. I think each of us ate for $7 to $14. Most sides were great, but the veggies were a little off. The chips and salsa are a must! The smokey salsa was incredible. 

Drinks were great. Margaritas were great, but the peach texas tea was incredible. Nice selection of beers and liquors.

I've enjoyed Kevin's food from his days at Rats and was pleased that he's as good as he was there.  The foie gras soup was incredible and the popovers were wonderful.  The Wagyu beef was excellent.  I ordered the ""Saffron Bucatini"" which was very ordinary.  My husband ordered the Carrot Rigatoni.  I didn't order that because I didn't want ""carrot rigatoni.""  What it really was was a delicious crispy rabbit dish - which I would have ordered.  Grrrr.  So don't rely on the title of the dish - read the descriptions (agreed that seems obvious).  The veal shoulder was fabulous.  

The bad news:  The restaurant feels extremely corporate.  The portions are very small (but you leave very full) so if there's something you really like you're only getting a little of it.  The wine is very measured also so its really $22 to get one proper glass.  The waiter, Benjamin, was not good.  Our reservation was for 6:45 and I felt he wanted us out as soon as possible.  He did not offer coffee (nor did we have any with desert) and he brought the bill to the table while I was still eating my desert.   That's fine for a corner Chinese take out joint with a few tables.  Not for fine dining.  For me this place  is a one and done based upon the corporate feel and the less than stellar service.  

Best advice: Kevin was and is a top chef so try Sbraga.  Have a few drinks before you get there but not enough where you're off your game to read the dish descriptions, ask for any waiter other than Benjamin or eat at the bar.

Elaborate? Why yes! This chicken shall!

If you love the taste and smell of delectable meat goodness, this place may be for you.  

During off peak hours it is a good place to have a bite, a beer and some Q.  During peak hours be prepared for crowded and sometimes loud.  That's OK, the menu usually makes up for it.  They do have their off days but that's the nature of BBQ (or so I've been told by my Q fanatic friends).

OK..... I wasn't really sure what we were supposed to do about another party arriving but I did not like feeling rushed when we arrived on time and before we were even seated.

In addition to fresh seafood, you can pick up a number of cooked dishes, fresh salads, sushi, and some produce and groceries including fresh bread. The crab cake sandwich is outstanding, as is the cole slaw if you're a cole slaw fan. The take-out menu is my new bucket list.

So far, I have found the service to be friendly and quick. Zero complaints.

A word of caution: if you see the lobster mac and cheese on the menu and think, wow I really want to try that, you need to call a day ahead to get some. I have not yet tried it because I walked in thinking I could just pick some up. Made-to-order means it is probably awesome, so I'm not going to complain about it, though at the time I may have done some foot-stomping until they gave me a sample of crab tomato gravy. Much like giving a kid a lollipop, it shut me right the hell up.",2013-07-22 02:12:12,

This is the chef that cooked at Blue Hill Farm in NY - which we enjoyed. He's originally from near Philly and his wife (who manages the house - and her two twin sons!) is from South Jersey. We considered ourselves lucky to get a reservation (8pm was earliest) as two major reviews gave it accolades.

The place is small - 28 chairs and the room is hard but there were mostly tables of two last night so noise was less than it could be.

To summarize upfront we were both under whelmed by the meal - based on the advance reviews. Now some more details.

The menu is presented as three course (appetizer, First Manin, 2nd Main .. will mention dessert later). 9oh yes, it is a BYOB and the stemware was great). Each course had 4 choices. And the menu is printed daily. There is not a lot of variety in each course.

Appetizer. We shared the Rare Beet Steak - which is the chef's signature dish - and it was delicious. ($10.00). Not big but tasty. At this point we were given hot Parker House rolls. (I had three over the course of the evening to sop up all sauces.) I don't remember the other 3 appetizers but all were $10 and most folks ordered the Beet.

First Main - Here was a choice of Chicken Livers (we don't eat those) a vegetable dish, Stuffed quail (which I read was the weak point of the menu) and warm smoked trout on a puree of green pea. We chose the latter and shared it. All were $12 or $13.. Small portions - on a big plate. Had some kind of herbs on it but it was salty. We decided it was almost boring.

Second Main - Choice was a free range chicken breast - we'd order that if we went back - only even partially substantial portion, lamb shoulder - with baby roasted potatoes and peas in a pea puree, Pork tenderloin w/ pork belly and potatoes, and something else (I forget).. I ordered the Lamb and it was two small slices which were fatty and more pea puree (similar to the smoked trout sauce) and it was salty. And I LOVE salt. This was too salty for me. She had the Prk and the small tenderloin (2 ounces?) was tasty but the belly was - of course - half fat, which you can't eat. At this point, thanks to the three rolls I was satisfied. Oh yes, the Second Mains were $27 to $29.

They don't push desserts here. They had only 2 (a panacotta and caramel something. I saw no one ordering dessert. Service was friendly and professional. Three servers for the 28 people.  The bill for two shared courses and two separate ""entrees"" was $78. before tax and tip.

We had high hopes of repeating the Blue Hill Farm experience but this didn't do it for us. I think we won't be ""rushing"" back.

I ordered a medium burger with provolone cheese and mushrooms with a side of truffle fries. I could smell the fries through the bag as I walked back to my office and couldn't wait to dig in. 
Honestly, I wasn't all that impressed. The fries were pretty tasty but didn't have the extra pizazz I was looking for. The burger was surprisingly tasteless; some more seasoning was definitely necessary. I was also kind of disappointed by the mushrooms. Again, not seasoned well and also, very few on my burger!

I split a slice of their plain pizza with my toddler who immediately said ""this is yummy in my tummy"". So that's pretty great. 
I also had the egg/sausage ""hot pocket"" and it was quite good.

I was skeptical that a pizza without cheese could be satisfying, but boy was I wrong. The crust was flavorful and chewy. The tomato sauce was sweet. The oregano was the perfect herb to give the pizza that something extra. Seriously, I was so surprised by how much I liked it.

The beer...not so much. Maybe I am spoiled. Maybe I am pretentious. But I did not like any of the beers. And yes, my eating companion and I did try them all. They all leaned bitter, even when the description did not suggest they would. Many of the options tasted like fall even though it is supposedly spring. It was disappointing.

MU0xxCADzUA3bouqo6bpKw,1LPYHtxTubcRnPDIe-Sk8w,uIZwBkvWicqyWraXvYOipw,2,2,2,2,"...oooo, this one was super-bad...

 2 stars only because I liked my other experiences here so much better (but they were not recent). If it were only due to an isolated item or 2, there'd be no need for this review.  Unfortunately, it was not.  To the lads in the kitchen, you need to step up the game.  

First the good points:  The foie gras soup...  always excellent.  It's creamy, not too rich, salty, a little spicy, different, delicious...  I love it.  Cheese selection... haha, I know - admittedly hard to screw up, but they made good choices and provided a decent portion.  Our waiter (Jason, I think) was very good too. 

The chef was the problem here.  If you don't want meat, you're not going to find much.  If you do like meat, you're not going to get much.  My friend's beef brisket entree was 1 cube of beef - if you had 12 of them you might fill an ice cube tray.   

Escargot with pasta shells... the combo seemed a risky bet.  You lose big when the pasta shells are almost as hard in the center as the snails' missing homes.  And no, it wasn't al dente (I like that).  Please cook the pasta.    

Do you enjoy pork fat? bacon? speck? thick cuts? Doesn't really matter b/c you won't find it in this ""pork belly.""  One of the most universally overplayed items on across town, this rendition stands out as the most confused ""pork-based"" first course ever.  My friend received 8 1x4 inch strips that closely resembled quality bacon (mmm...), but only in 2D as they were sliced so thin that they were practically holographic.  They were, however, wide enough to hold the burgeoning load of chili oil, hot pepper and other indiscernible spices that the chef heaped on.  When I tried it, the cruel trick became obvious.  All that that warm, smoky, fatty pork belly goodness for which I had hoped was mere illusion on the plate, replaced by pure heat.  It's was like the cinnamon challenge, only much pricier and for grown-ups.  

Tortuous proportions of heat were a common theme appearing also in the veg, like the broccoli rabe that accompanied my roast pork entree.  Thank god that it too was a thimble-sized portion.  I love hot food, and spice, but c'mon people.  It was ridiculous.  

Beets, pickles and ""bacon-like"" things were all the rave on Sbraga's plates.  It really made me realize how much I hate that.  And while I also often disagree with our resident James Beard Award-winning ""expert"" food ""journalist"", and wish he would find work that required him to keep his inarticulate, cynical, simpleton and always profane thoughts out of all published media, as I ate my 1/32nd-of-an-inch-shaved pickles off the plate in a vain attempt to chase the heavy spice off my tongue, I found myself in violent agreement with his S**% That Has to Stop Right Now as relates to Sbraga (though I suspect he might have aimed his torpedo at Farmer's Cabinet).  The food that showed up on Sbraga's dishes has certainly had it's run in the mainstream, and I'm sorry to say, but maybe so has Sbraga.  +1 to Mr. Sheehan.",2013-10-13 22:33:00,"{'food': ['foie gras soup', 'cheese selection', 'beef brisket', 'broccoli rabe', 'roast pork'], 'drink': []}"

We arrived at 7:30 pm on Saturday before a nearby concert.  We walked in and the place looked pretty cool compared to what it had been.  We found two seats at a half crowded bar.  The bartender seemed nice enough at first.  She was pleasant and offered us a menu.  

We ordered a large bottle of hard cider to share and I asked about gluten-free items.  The bartender said she would ask the chef and get back to us.  Roughly 10 minutes later, she came back to us and asked if we were ready to order.  We reminded her that we were waiting to hear about gluten-free items.  She remembered and went back into the kitchen.  About 10 minutes later she came back, and full misinformed about gluten intolerance (told me to stay away from anything with potatoes), started guiding me through the menu.  I corrected her, she went back into the kitchen, came back out, and gave me an updated version of her recommendations.

We ordered the wings (for the BF), fries, crab cakes (no filler, coated in potato chips), and a salad.  

Ten minutes later, she checked back in on us and I ordered a black cherry gimlet, which looked really tasty.  Twenty minutes later (still no food), she stopped by to ask how we were doing.  We reminded her of the drink order and she made it without charging us.  It was actually quite good.

Our wings, fries, and crab cakes were solid, but uneventful (until later - you'll see).  

Still no salad.  We asked about the salad and were told it was on its way.  Close to 10 minutes later, no salad.  It was 9 pm.  We had been there for 1.5 hours.  So we asked for our check, hoping to catch the headliner at the concert.  As we received it, the salad arrived.  We had to pass.

We headed to the concert about 2.5 blocks away.  As soon as we entered, the BF felt terrible.  He left the venue and headed to my place (another 2 blocks).  Before he could even make it there, he puked in the alley.  The chicken wings had become eventful.

Warehouse like (a small warehouse if there is such a thing.) There are places to sit at the bar and if you're lucky one of only a few tables by the front of the restaurant. The music is pretty loud which didn't bother me but I can see it being irritating to some. I love how you can see the chefs cook out in the open. Really cool. Of the appetizers, I ordered the the Black Garlic Wings. They were a bigger and meatier wing than I typically prefer but it was a very good and unique appetizer none the less. They came with shishito peppers (not spicy), lime, and cilantro. Squeeze the lime onto the sticky sesame sauce and you're in business. For my main entree I throughly enjoyed the Brisket Noodle Soup with Matzo ball, Kimchi, Sesame Chili Broth, and Bok Choy. The broth had the perfect amount of heat. The kimchi really made this dish special. A bit more Kimchi would've been great as I found myself wanting more after I devoured the small amount. The brisket was tender but had some edge fat that I found myself biting around. Leaner meat would be great as the soup seasoning wouldn't disrupt the advantage of a flavorful fatty piece of meat. The matzo ball was not too firm and not too mushy. It was delicious. Overall I was pleased and would certainly return. This isn't a place to go with a large group due to its size. Start working on your chop stick skills so you can have many well balanced bites as you will attempt to put together small pieces of meat, matzo ball, noodle, bok choy, and kimchi within the larger sized deep spoon for some magical mouthfuls.

We were seated pretty much right away upstairs by the window and then our server arrived almost immediately to take our drink order. The kids liked the children's menu and the activities on it and we had the short ribs with polenta and the seared scallops as well as two cocktails. 

My only complaint is that the bathroom is in the adjacent hotel, past the elevators, down the stairs and halfway down the hallway. It was kind of a pain ONLY because once one kid went mid-way through dinner the other one had to go as soon as the first one got back. That's my coordination problem, not the restaurant's. But if the bathroom was inside the restaurant, it would have been slightly less inconvenient. 

It's not cheap but keeping in mind the location and quality of food and drink it's not expensive either. We hardly get to go out ourselves, so we took advantage of being on vacation to go out one night to a nice place and not have fast food. It was worth it.",2016-07-08 11:07:43,

I mean, I once waited 45 minutes for a fish sandwich, when the estimated time was 10 min, and I was the only one waiting around. I did notice something though: the faithful patrons tend to do sneaky things. For example, they'll place an order and then walk over to Wawa. Or they order and then hang out in their cars. Or, the three people ahead of you actually order for the 55 members of their family reunion. Giving you the 'impression' that there's only 1-3 people ahead you when there's really 58.

BUT, if you manage to fight the good fight and your patience wins, what you take home will likely be worth it. For me, the fish was perfectly seasoned, crunchy golden batter on the outside and flaky juiciness in the inside. Mac and cheese was good as well, creamy and cheesy the way it should be. I will say that not all my experiences have been like this. A few times the fish was bland, but still cooked well (hot sauce fixed the former issue right up). And a few times the cooks seemed intent on pissing each other off (the food always takes a hit in this case). But most of my experiences have been positive enough to make me come back again.

Beware that they are cash-only. I understand it's a food truck, but it's university city and it's 2014. Gotta knock off a star for the cash-only situation and inconsistency. Otherwise, bring cash and lots of patience!

Note to Owner: I have seriously driven to your location, found parking during the lunch rush (quite a feat on its own), only to remember that you are cash only. Subsequently drove home and made a PB&J in place of your fish platter. You are likely losing good business because of this.

They have a dinner menu that includes cheeses/meats, salads, crostinis with different spreads, small plates, pizzas, and entrees. I chose pea soup, and the burrata pizza. The pea soup was a beautful bright green color, and they poured it into my bowl at the table. It was fresh and delicious, but a little too salty. The burrata pizza was delicious! It had cauliflower, golden raisins, pine nuts, and capers on it. Sounds weird, but it was soooo good! My husband had the meatballs and the olive oil potatoes. He really liked the meatballs. I tasted them, and they tasted pretty standard to me. The olive oil potatoes were really good. Whole potatoes, a bit squished and fried, served with a chive dipping sauce. I used the sauce on my pizza crust too! The only thing I didn't like about this place was the price. Pretty expensive for the amount of food you get for some of the menu items. 

The other couple split the pepperonata appetizer, a pepperoni pizza, and a spicy ham pizza. It seems like they enjoyed it all. The pepperoni pizza had TONS of pepperoni on it. The spicy ham had raw jalapeños on it, and they took most of them off because it was too spicy.

We started with the Horiatiki Salad - chopped tomatoes, cucumber, radishes, red onions, parsley and a PERFECTLY light olive oil vinaigrette that literally ""sang"" in the mouth.  Just the right amount of salt & pepper - fresh, balanced, crisp and light for summer.

We them shared the Boureka (Phyllo pastry stuffed with savory cheese) topped with a drizzle of sweet, floral honey.  The sweet 'n savory combo was perfectly showcased by the beet salad (fresh, red beet chunks and herbs) along side.  It was like dessert for an app.  Swwet and luscious.

Thing just got better & better.

John, our server brought the main entree ($28) a Whole Dorrado fileted tableside (albeit a bit clumsily).  Wrapped in Grapeleaves, drizzled with a fruity Olive Oil and lemon, it was cooked perfectly and we each ate every last bit.  (My friend did discover a few scales on her fish - but I did not.)

Equally wonderful was the side of steaming-hot kale, tomato and onion.  That is just my kinda food!

We shared a dessert sampler (Small $8, Large would have been $12) which came with nutty, crispy baklava, a honey-drenched semolina cake (reminiscent of my Aunt's honey cake).  Both great.  It also came with a shortbread stuffed with a date paste - not so great.

But most facinating perhaps, was the center piece on the dessert plate - a whole blanched fig that we still can't quite figure out how it was prepared.  But, boy was it tasty.  I love fresh figs.

I wish they would add a fresh fig plate or a fruit plate of some sort to the summer desserts.

We brought our own Prosecco, beer & cider and had a lovely summer evening meal.

SUPER!  A hair's bredth away from 5 stars - but certain aspects of service and prep are still 4 star.

S6-Iwyy8CvLLbHuJwjZbzg,HTgsSLhJEcY2_V8LIxuzMQ,sdWuLh-auc0nC2Jy6_26AQ,4,6,1,7,"The Black Sheep never disappoints me.  When I first moved to Philadelphia, I tried to eat here and sat at a table forever trying to get service.  I eventually left.  Little did I know that if you sit down stairs, that is not the real restaurant, simply the bar.  Yes, you can get food, but on a busy night you'd be better off going upstairs to the dining room (where there is also another bar and TVs to watch the game).

Upstairs the restaurant area fits in well with one's idea of what an Irish Pub/Inn would feel like.  Wood floors, soft lighting, wooden booths and tables, and small pained glass windows.  There are several large tables upstairs for groups up to (I would guess) 8 people.  There are pictures of sheep, everywhere.  Go figure.

On the subject of food, I'm always satisfied with what I order.  Every day they have a special menu of ""additional"" entree options.  They are always something interesting dishes (henceforth, not always Irish) for reasonable prices.  Entrees rarely break the $20 mark.  The main menu is also very good.  If I were to go just to get some dinner without wanting anything special, I would get the ""Bangers and Mash"" or ""Guinness Beef Stew"" or ""Sheppard's Pie"" for $10.

The desserts are fine, but nothing spectacular.  They make their own apple crisp, but have the other desserts brought in from a local bakery unlike some other local restaurants.  (See my review of ""Royal Tavern"".)

I will make and additional comment about their food pricing.  It appears as though the more ""fancy"" menu items are priced more in line with their inherent value and the more ""common"" items are more expensive.  Here's what I mean.  The other night there were braised pork medallions with two sides and a lemon grass salad for $14.  A burger costs $10.  It just doesn't make sense.  The burgers are great and come with cheese, caramelized onions, and fries, but the most any restaurant (outside of Barclay Prime) can charge for a burger is $8.75 in my opinion. (To me, a burger is only worth $6.75 and that should include lettuce, tomato and fries.)

My other issue is that the upstairs dining room has THREE TVs.  It is a small space and the glowing images get distracting and tiresome.  The only reason people go upstairs to watch the game is because the downstairs is too crowded.  Typically, there are about four people actually watching and everyone else is trying to look the members of their table in the eye without looking over to watch a Sierra Mist commercial.

Other than that issue, I love going to this place and will return again and again.",2007-09-07 13:12:12,

My husband, daughter and I brought a friend who was visiting from the West Coast.  The server was really nice. Her and the mosaic covered patio were probably the best part of Gennaro's.  

As someone noted in another review, they don't have high chairs here. It seems rather odd considering its an average quality pizza place. Luckily, our daughter is tall enough not to need one, but I wouldn't have been super excited if I had a younger child. Also, the front door has a sign saying something along the lines of ""Well behaved children are welcome."" Ok Gennaro's, you aren't that great. Your pizza is a few steps above Pizza Hut.  The POPE is a pub up the street that is very welcoming to kids. Le Virtu is a pretty high end restaurant up the street that is very welcoming to kids. I can't imagine childless people are showing up in droves at Gennaro's when there is Brigantessa almost directly across the street (which by the way also has high chairs.)

Also, they served out food with paper plates. Seriously. We ended up paying over $50 for pretty bland pizza, super dry foccacia bread, and their version of sangria. And we ate it off of paper plates!

My friends recently went there during University City Dining days and had a great experience so I was looking forward to trying it, too.  My opportunity came when my friend wanted to ""go out"" to celebrate her completion of the bar exam that day.  At first I thought she meant ""go out"" like to a crowded bar somewhere downtown but when her husband explained that we were going to Vientiane Cafe I was more than happy to tag along.  I think one of the reasons I had never gone there was that it doesn't look like anything special from the outside, so I was surprised to see just how large it was inside when we got there.  The ambiance was nice.  I felt like we could be ourselves, talking about the ""bag lady"" at the bar, and be boisterous without being awkward.  But it was still quiet enough to enjoy a more relaxing meal.  

We had a group of 7 of us and they easily and quickly accommodated us.  Between the seven of us I think we all ordered either the Panang Curry or the Pad Thai.  Both were delicious but the panang curry was truly something special.  I really don't know how they made it so good but it was SO good.  It makes me mouth water just thinking about it now.  One thing I will say, though, is that the spice levels really don't matter at all.  The have a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the spiciest.  I got a 4 and most of the others got 2, however they all tasted the same, which was not so spicy.  Normally I would have been really upset that it wasn't very spicy but the flavor was so good I didn't even care.

If a manager can account for the patron's behavior to clear up any misunderstanding, that's a plus in my books.
My friends and I opted for the Restaurant week menu, and I was curious to see if the Yelp special was valid too, but alas, our waiter said no... A few minutes go by when an appetizer dish that had no resemblance to a salad comes by to our delightful surprise!  A succulent bacon wrapped salad seared in simple balsamic vinegar that instantly found its way into my stomach.  Can You Say ""HEAVEN""?!  Douglas, the manager stated above, made a visit to our table asking how the yelp special was. Immediately I asked if he was the man responsible for the Yelp debate and it was nice to put a face to the man.  Great Guy!

This is a mistake on the part on the part of the kitchen and the server. How hard is it to coordinate things? It usually happens in restaurants that are half full and the kitchen has time on its hands. Rather than waiting for the appetizer plates to be cleared, the kitchen occupies itself by making the entree and sending it out. The diner has three choices, to accept the dish and have the table jammed with dishes, have the half-finished appetizer plates cleared, or send the entrees back to the kitchen only to sit out until the server comes back to pick it up and serve it. We were less than half done with the appetizers when we were confronted with the choice at Zorba's and elected to send the entrees back. If restaurants and servers only realized how irritating this is for some diners. Of course you can lower the tip to convey the message to the server and send back the tried out food to the kitchen where the chef may notice it. In this case the owner did and brought us out a complimentary dessert. Notice to chefs and owners ... a free dessert does NOT make up for a crappy meal!

The menu is small and varied, offering appetizers, smaller plates, and main dishes.

The steak dish we ordered was excellent, exactly medium rare, the caramelized exterior accentuating the richness of the flavorful beef.  Since The Pig ranks first in our pantheon of tasty animals, we had to order the restaurant's ode to pork:  a plate of various parts of the pig (a rib, some belly, a little bit of snout, and a larger piece of pork shoulder).  Most parts were very good except for the badly cut shoulder piece that was almost all fat.  The two deserts were both lovely, displaying a light touch and fine ingredients.

So why four stars (actually 4.5) and not five?

They wanted to have a cheese steak. While others in the group wanted to take the trek down to South Philly to Pat's & Geno's, I suggested Chink's since it wasn't too far from where we were staying (and I had been to both Pat's & Chink's). We split up and I went with another couple to Chink's.
Another reason is because it was a little chilly outside and where  Pat's & Geno's only have outside sidewalk tables, Chink's has indoor seating.

It is a small throwback eatery with several booths and a counter. The flattop grill is in the front window which you can watch them cook from the street.

Their steaks come sliced and they offer two sizes which is good if you can't eat a lot and don't want to spend a lot.
The steak and rolls were delicious. We ordered a Shamrock shake and learned what ""Jimmie's"" are.

If you want the hype then go to the other places. If you want to sit down and have a tasty steak that can hang with the best of them, some friendly characters and nostalgia then come here.

We had narrowed our options down to Maribel's and one other restaurant but the Yelp ratings convinced us to go with Maribel's.

Everyone is super friendly and attentive. We ordered the guacamole which was delicious as were the chips. I ordered the Chicken Tinga Tostadas which were absolutely delicious. They were packed with sooo much flavor and had a nice kick to it (spice wise). My BF ordered the pork and chicken tacos and he absolutely loved them. My only ""complaint"" which really isn't legit is that I wish the portion of guacamole was a little larger. 
Just as an FYI for future diners- It is a BYOB restaurant- they gave plastic disposable cups (which was totally fine for us). There is no parking lot, but we had no issue finding street parking.

The last appetizer was ""zucchini : ranch yogurt : fennel : crispy quinoa"" for $14.  The diner didn't say anything about it that I remember.

For main courses we had ""handmade pasta : daily preparation"" for $24. Boring and small dish.  The ""steak : grilled peach : cucumber : mushroom soubise"" for $28, was 4 1""x1.5"" slices of delicious steak that was at least 1/3 fat.

We took a taxi to the restaurant and were really impressed by the neigborhood.  From what I could tell it was what you might call Bohemian and definitely cool for a guy who has lived in Texas his whole life.  

Entering the restaurant is like entering a tent in Morroco, they have material on the walls and ceiling.  We were seated on pillows on the floor around a large table.  The waiter came and explained how the restaurant worked and gave us water to wash our hands (you eat with your hands).  He then brought out mint tea which was amazing (I'm not a tea drinker).  

The dishes came out one by one and I remember everyone being timid at first to use their hands and to try the sometimes strange foods (our waiter explained each dish as it was presented).  By the end, when each dish came out, we all grabbed at it, not wanting to let someone else eat our portion of the wonderful food.  A specific dish I remember was a pastry covered scrambled egg dish with cinnamon and other spices.  As explained, it sounded suspect and one of our group had to be the guinea pig and try it first.  On his approval, we all dug in and it was VERY ho, but SOOOO good that we all burned our fingers pulling out the next bits to stuff into our mouths.  

I see members of this group on occaision and we all remember our meal here even nine years later.  We've tried to recreate it by going to other Morrocan places, but this was definitely a moment in time not to be re-lived.  

We were all so impressed by the city that we walked (quite a good distance) back to the hotel.

Food...

Tasty little brioche type bread was nice but not enough.  It looked comically tiny on the plate and made me think of rationing.

Parsnip soup was good and would be eaten again.  Same for the winter salad...though we could have used some bread.  Without it, you can't get the last bit of the soup or the last of the salad's pistachio puree.  It would've also looked good  next to the salad, which comes oddly plated, way off to the side of the dish.  

Next course took way too long to come. When it did, the fish was good for 4/5 of the dish.  But that last 20% was not cooked enough.  It was so undercooked as to be red and mushy and impossible to cut with my knife, so I left it.  The crispy top of the fish was good and so were the accompanying veggies, but that last uncooked bit left me disappointed. The scallops on the other hand were cooked well...but they were enormous.  The initial taste was satisfying, but the thickness and scale of the scallop overly accentuated its texture and composition, making a bight feel giant and squishy. 

Setting...

It was too cozy.  Take out a table or two... We were fine when we just had neighbors on one side, but when the table on the other side filled, conversing became frustrating.  We couldn't compete with the guy next to us.  Feeling boxed in an unable to talk makes it hard to enjoy a meal.  It also makes the long wait for a second course feel even longer.  

We skipped dessert.

R2L is not worth a revisit. Unless, you're newly single and looking to impress a new date. And another new date. And another new date.

Food. Another Restaurant Week, a new menu. Same dessert. My favorite part was the dessert last time, so I'm glad they kept that the same! The fried risotto balls were OK. It was like a grown-up version of fried cheese balls you can get at a dive bar, but with risotto. The poached and fried chicken, which looked almost exactly like the Chicken Picnic, were both just OK. The portions were extremely small. The chicken was cooked well, but lacked seasoning. Celery didn't add much to the dish, but to me, actually took away from the dish. It didn't have a place on the plate. It added a separate texture that didn't connect with the dish. The lobster mac and cheese was wack. The bechamel, although very creamy, was not flavorful. For the different types of cheeses used in the bechamel, it lacked saltiness.

Drinks. For a lounge that boasts some of the best views in Philly, you would think the drinks should be up to par, especially for the hefty price tags. Apparently, you're just paying for the view, not for the quality of drinks. I would think R2L would have some legitimate mixologists, especially with the fancy cocktails they have on the menu. But every drink either had too much liquor or not enough. You were either taking alcohol to the face in the form of a cocktail or you were sipping on soda with a splash of liquor. A meager splash.

Service. For a place so well-staffed, man... service was hecka slow. Dinner took 2.5 hours, so plan accordingly. This doesn't include our appetizer order while waiting at the bar.

EurSaCtCZ4aK0NkzfOSgkQ,8L6GaHu1GRV1kFmPJmwLQA,_RwlMTw9uFeOkfX9Ctf1HA,2,7,0,2,"I went here last night with my girlfriend because it's very close to our residence and because anywhere named ""Famous Seafood"" deserves a chance.

When we walked in, there was a guy vacuuming the walkway in front of the entrance & bar, and we were very confused about where to go. He told us to walk ahead and they'd take care of us. A few moments later, a woman came out and seated us. The menu has a decent amount of choices, and I would have ordered the crab had they been upfront and listed the crab pricing rather than putting ""M/P"". When will restaurants learn that people coming to a seafood place often want crab, want to know the price without asking, and ""M/P"" just turns people away? 

We ordered the fried crab balls and the shrimp cocktail for appetizers, and then shared the scallop entree, and surf & turf entree for dinner. The food was OK, not great.  It seemed like bar food, trying to fit in what they are trying to make a nice restaurant. They are very expensive for the quality of food you get. This place could be so much more if they had better chefs & recipes. One other point to add in here, it's very much a turn off to receive seafood that hasn't been cleaned properly. The shrimp were not all fully deveined, some still had legs, and one still had a shell on it. If I wanted U-Peel-It shrimp, I wouldn't have ordered Shrimp Cocktail. It was a turn-off to my girlfriend and I (because we just weren't expecting to take a bite out of shrimp shell). Again, better chefs who properly prep all the food would have been key here to making the experience better and POTENTIALLY worth the price. The scallops were OK at best, they were mushy and the sauce they came in was not very flavorful.  The surf & turf was the best of all the food we had, and I'd actually rate that as pretty good. They cooked the steak to just the right temperature and it was a good cut of meat, unfortunately though it lacked any flavor, to the point we had to ask for A1 sauce which is a sin if you are eating a center cut filet mignon. 

The waitress was excellent, which is the only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one.  She was very attentive to our table, refilled our drinks promptly, and stopped by frequently to check and see if we needed anything. 

If you want better food cheaper pricing, I'd recommend somewhere like Snockey's or Red Lobster. If you are looking to take someone on a nice date and don't care about the cost, take them to Ocean Prime in Center City, which has way better quality of food. For the $120 bill we paid last night, we could have eaten at Ocean Prime which is as nice as the highest grade Starr Restaurants in Philly and actually our new favorite steak/seafood place. 

I won't be returning unless they redo the kitchen staff and the menu to make this place more worth the price. It was bad value for what you pay, which is never an experience the customer should have.  

Trust the other YELP reviews. They are right.  Try a different place for dinner tonight.",2014-09-14 12:56:38,"{'food': ['fried crab balls', 'shrimp cocktail', 'scallop entree', 'surf & turf entree'], 'drink': []}"

- Low ceilings, some exposed to show the structural beams and vents -  a very tight bar area, not easily navigable.  The décor is a bit cliché, very dark, and am not particularly feeling the cougar-ish appeal of it all (literally, there is fake cougar fabric lining the bar banquettes) - and right away, you realize what this place is catering to:

- Cougars, wealthy ones, main-liners, suburbanites wanting a big night in the city, business types, the wheelin' and dealin' types that can afford to pay $12 per uninventive, standard cocktails. (Eight boring ones to be exact - 2 per liquor type, with an even shorter beer list, a semi-decent wine selection and everything is overpriced).

- Food is the only slight redeeming factor - and though the menu on its face, appeared interesting, the Gayle Daniel Stern food I was expecting was not present here.  Perhaps, another kink to work out once everyone is settled?

I read the menu at home before I headed over to Ants Pants and loved what I read!

Ordered:
The Stack -- So delicious and includes a side salad. Great mix of flavors and the bacon was perfectly cooked. Definitely appreciated the fresh ingredients.

Brekkie Platter -- Perfect eggs, bacon, mushrooms, and toast. I loved that it didn't come with cheese, too. Nothing green here, but my over-hard eggs were perfect. No complaints here.

Single French Toast -- Had to try something sweet. French Toast was the best I've had in a long time. Not soggy at all and sprinkled with a little cinnamon and powdered sugar.

Au Lait -- Delightful coffee with steamed milk. No sugar needed, because this was a perfect balance.

Flat White -- Wake up espresso! Perfect with a pretty design in the froth too.

Blueberry & Dark Chocolate Milkshake -- Now, this was FABULOUS! Perfect milkshake, and a delicious dessert, as it was ordered to-go at the end of our meal.

The waiter was extremely friendly and read us the specials, and was happy to answer any questions.  I came into the night not being a fan of artichoke...I left loving artichokes.  Their stuffed artichoke appetizer was phenomenal.  My girlfriend was instantly hooked.  

Next, our entrees came out in the perfect amount of time, and they were absolutely delicious.  Fresh pastas, chicken, sausage and sauce.  The menu was just large enough to have a wide variety without being over bearing.  

For dessert, we each had a nice cannoli with extra creamy filling.  Topped off with an espresso and the meal was complete.  

The meal was a good price for everything, and having it as a BYOB allowed us to bring exactly what we wanted.  the service was attentive, and extremely friendly.

We walked into the small storefront and were greeted by a warm smile behind the counter. We settled on a half order of the buttermilk ranch chicken and six chili garlic style wings (which we were told were excellent choices btw.) The lovely lady behind the counter told us she'd cut us a break and just charge us for the whole chicken instead of two halves to save a buck. 

Then of course, we needed to decide on donuts. Lots of their specialty donuts were sold-out so we stuck with the classics. I ordered the Indian Cinnamon and Bry went with the Apollonia Spice, then as if our day couldn't get any better, the sweet lady behind the counter told us she would throw in the Vanilla Lavendar for free, just so we could try it! Bam! They just earned themselves a lifelong customer. The inside of the store is minimalist and charming, there are about six seats at the counter so if there is an open spot, snatch it up quick!

The buttermilk ranch was my absolute favorite. I loved the flavor and crispiness of the outside and the chicken was crazy moist on the inside. I've had dreams about it every night since I first got my hands on it. 

Please note: and we were newbies so we had no idea, with every order of chicken you get a tasty honey lemon donut to go along (pictured below.)

The food remains tasty and the bar service has been impeccable but the table service has begun to be an issue. On our last visit there were multiple problems with our server. The most troubling of which was when we ordered fried cheese curds for our appetizers we were served their buffalo fried mac and cheese balls. After these were quickly dropped off at our table, our server ran away before we could even examine the food. Whether intentional or not (we were one of two tables on the porch, so I can easily see it not being intentional) we had to wait for 5-10 minutes before our server returned so we can even ask about this mistake. Her response? ""We don't have cheese curds anymore, we're working under a new menu."" So why did you substitute something (that was nearly twice as expensive) without asking? Is the rest of our food going to be similar substitutes since we ordered from a menu they were apparently no longer serving? My fiancee hates spicy food so this substitution wasn't acceptable for her. The waitress didn't do anything to correct this problem and treated the problem as our mistake for ordering the wrong thing. It's a simple mistake and I actually enjoyed the mac and cheese balls, but the attitude that it was our fault for ordering from the menu we were given was the problem. 

As far as positives, the food is rather tasty even when its something we did not order. The burgers are delicious and well cooked, and the roast beef sandwich is also great. The beer selection is great and has a nice range of breweries and styles. The various happy hour specials are good and the atmosphere has a nice range of quiet and relaxing during off hours to fun and energetic during busier happy hours.

So my first impression was to think this was named by an alpha couple who clearly thought their soft tofu pot was slamming! I accept your Iron Chef soft tofu pot challenge!

They rightfully win the challenge, deserving four stars for a proper, good sizzling bubbly hot soon doo bu (Korean tofu pot). They also have a full Korean menu, but do come here for a soon doo bu as this is their specialty. If I was to judge the restaurant only on their tofu pot, it gets five stars.

Priced at a steal for $10, you can select an assortment of tofu pots (beef, pork, seafood, mushroom, oyster, clam or tofu only), ranging from not spicy to spicy. 

Jap chae is ""so-so"" here. But then again, you should come here for the restaurant's specialty, and should you forget, let the restaurant's name listed on Yelp help you remember!

The owners are such good people and have an interesting life story. My sister in law lost a Swarovski bracelet a year ago in their garage. We came back a year later and the owner recognized us as the possible owners of the bracelet. Unbelievable, and he still had it wrapped up in a small lost and found area.

I went with a group of friends for Han Dynasty's 3 course dining days menu. I know some people frown down on restaurant week, but portion and selection were not problems here. We received regular sized appetizer and entre portions. Our third course could either be dessert or a choice of two alcoholic beverages. I was planning on having a drink anyways so I went with the Grand Royal as my third course. Doing some quick math, it was like getting a drink for free with my dinner. 

With five in the group, it made sense to try each of the five appetizers being offered: cold sesame noodles, dumplings in chili oil, dan dan noodles, spicy crispy cucumbers and Sichuan pickled veggies. The dan dan noodles are everything people say they are, and easily were a group favorite. The cucumbers were served cold and were a very refreshing savory dish. The cold sesame noodles were also great. The pickled veggies were probably the least favorite of the selection. According to the menu, they were at spice level 10 on a 1 to 10 scale. I was ready to totally underestimate the spice scale at that point. I probably could have also walked away from the table full and gone home happy. 

Despite the vast array of appetizers ordered, each member of my party went with a variation of the Dry Pot. All but one of us went with the maximum spice level possible, and even poked fun at our friend for going with a 7. At the end of the meal, he was the only one at the table who wasn't sweating, crying or dealing with a runny nose. My dry pot chicken was extremely spicy and to be honest I probably would have enjoyed it better a notch or two down. You've been warned. It was still delicious though! 

The only thing restaurant week-esq was the service. Our server was friendly, but not really attentive. The place was by no-means packed either. We were told that there would be a gap between our appetizers and entrees but then 2 out of 5 entrees came out early. A few of us also asked for clean plates for the entrees. It was an odd time during the meal because we still were working on our appetizers but also had our entrees. One of the staff members brought me a new plate and took away my appetizer plate that I told her I was still eating off of. My husband was able to retain his until he finished shortly after. 

Having only dined at the Manayunk Han Dynasty, I was impressed by the open and lofty atmosphere. It was spacious and modern looking. 

Service aside, we really enjoyed our overall experience. And since it was Dining Days, I'm not going to hold it against them. We also learned a valuable lesson: when Han Dynasty says spicy, they mean it!",2015-07-23 16:45:54,"{'food': ['cold sesame noodles', 'dumplings in chili oil', 'dan dan noodles', 'spicy crispy cucumbers', 'Sichuan pickled veggies'], 'drink': ['Grand Royal']}"

The restaurant is pretty nice. Kind of gives off a traditional korean feel to it. Around the restaurant you'll find posters of kpop idols and dramas hanging around. Since I keep up with those kind of things I find it really cool and interesting. 

I usually order the bbq meat and tried most items from the menu. My sister and I both enjoy the prime ribs ones. It's really flavorful and goes well with rice and the lettuce. I really like the spicy pork and its usually put in last because the sauce it marinate in burns on the grill. Like the prime ribs this is amazing and ordered it both time I went. For the other meat you can also ask for some red pepper paste for that special kick to add some spice to it. The pork belly taste really yummy dip in that and wrap up in the lettuce with the daikon radish. With the meal it comes with steamed egg for service and that's pretty yummy too. Eat it a bit early on in the meal because it'll deflate if it sits out for too long.  

They also have korean pancake, fried rice, stir fry, soup, hot pot and other different korean dishes if you aren't up for korean bbq. 

You might think its a lot of work cutting up the meat and checking if its ready to eat or not but there's this really nice lady that comes around and periodically check on the meat and if you're new to korean BBQ, she'll show you how to wrap the lettuce and what possibility you can put into it.

I ordered the BBQ chicken which came with mac and cheese and a side salad.  The mac and cheese was very good - it reminded me of the kind I used to eat as a kid (i.e. Velveeta)  I won't go as far to say that's what was used, but it had that same sort of thick, creamy texture.  The chicken was really, really overcooked.  Chicken is only supposed to be crispy if it has skin on it - not a boneless skinless breast.  They slathered it in sauce, probably hoping I wouldn't notice, but it's hard to miss when your knife can't really cut through it and it crunches in your mouth.  It had been sitting under heat lamps for a while because the sauce had that hazy film on it that is the tell tale side of old sauce.

Definitely order the fried green beans because they are the one thing on the menu that consistently delivers. The other menu items are either delicious or mediocre- sometimes the grilled cheese special is quite tasty, other times it is soggy and disappointing. 

When I first went to Prohibition Taproom they had a delicious menu of cocktails, including a very powerful Prohibition Punch. A few months later, they stopped offering these cocktail menus, and I wonder, why did they do this?

Finally, the service. Sometimes it's friendly, sometimes not so much. I've been there when they were welcoming of a small group (5-6 of us) and times when they acted like we were horribly inconveniencing them by not all arriving at the exact same time.

Highlights:
Shrimp Burritos
Some Chicken Taco Salad thing...and I guess the food in general. Everything I've tasted here is pretty good. I like the interesting mix of Mexican and BBQ dishes on the menu.
The decor/vibe. It always feels like a good time in here.

In the Middle:
The margaritas are good enough. Not my favorite drinks in the world. But theyre cheap so no real complaints there.
The setup inside makes it kind of hard to come here with really large parties
The service is always so-so. For my friends bday they messed up her seating arrangement and then charged her $35 to serve her own cake. I thought that was a little ridiculous and unnecessary.
Chips and salsa are like a dollar per person who touches it and like they really will check to see who alls eating it. I think this is weird. 

Worries Me:
Cleanliness. Friend reported seeing an actual rat in the building while we were here for a friends birthday. And that makes me very paranoid while Im eating here. Therefore, I will never come to this restaurant on my own. Nor will I suggest it. I only come here when this is where a group of friends all really really really want to come to hang out and I'd be a party pooper if I didn't tag along.",2011-06-01 23:14:46,"{'food': ['Shrimp Burritos', 'Chicken Taco Salad'], 'drink': ['Margaritas']}"

I'm not sure I've found gelato in NYC I love as much as I love Capogiro (thus I've resorted to buying pints of Talenti gelato instead) and I was so excited to get Capo when I visited campus again this past weekend.

The gelato here is extremely refreshing and unique. The flavors rotate fairly frequently, to the point where I've come here multiple days during the week and see new flavors every day. the shop itself is extremely clean and very modern. The staff is friendly and allow you to try as many flavors as you want. A small is around $5 and can hold two different flavors. Honestly, you can't come in here and NOT find a flavor you like. It's impossible.

My favorite flavors include blood orange (a seasonal flavor that blows my mind every time--Talenti blood orange gelato just isn't as good... I miss Capogiro dearly), Mexican coffee, lemon for those hot summer days, dark chocolate, mango, grapefruit, and pretty much almost every other fruit flavor / chocolate / coffee flavor.

But it was my husband's birthday and P&K was his choice, so off we went!

I really liked the atmosphere of this place.  It was dark, but not too dark.  Cozy but still felt more upscale than a local joint.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  Plus they had a good beer list.  I was hooked before our food arrived.

For our meal, we tried the smoked salmon topped deviled eggs and homemade potato chips with a cauliflower cheese dip to start.  I went with a steak, while my husband went with the burger (despite it not being the ""FAMOUS"" one).

The smoked salmon deviled eggs were amazing.  I'm pretty sure I ate mine in about one second flat.  The chips with the cheese dip were equally as tasty.  I wish they had come with some veggies or other accoutrement-- the chip to dip ratio was too low!  And I TOTALLY DID NOT eat the rest of the dip with a fork ...

So about my entree.  Words cannot describe how fast I ate that dish.  The meat was cooked perfectly, and it came with some delicious sauteed scallions and onions and a potato rosti (block of scalloped potatoes, for those of you like me who had no clue what that was).  Everything was covered in this delicious au jus.  As for the birthday boy, he enjoyed his burger, but clearly not as much as I loved my meal.  If you visit and the steak is being served, please order it.

So why 5 stars?  I debated between 4 and 5.  There were a couple of things that bugged me (menu is not posted online, prices were a tad high, tables were very close to each other) but ultimately, I decided that because a month later I was still dreaming of that steak and those deviled eggs and that heavenly cheese dip that I TOTALLY DID NOT eat with a fork... this place definitely deserved all 5 stars.",2013-11-20 21:44:42,"{'food': ['smoked salmon deviled eggs', 'potato chips with cauliflower cheese dip', 'steak', 'potato rosti'], 'drink': []}"

A lot of people rave about the duck fat fries with the sly fox dipping sauce, but I think they're just alright...nothing too special about them.  Most recently, my BF got the Kentucky Hot Brown, which is not really a sandwich, but more of a delicious cast iron skillet full of delicious cheese sauce, turkey, and some sort of bread that is like a pancake, but not soggy.  I may have to defect from ordering my burger and switch over to that next time.  

Drinks are pricey, but well worth it.  The bee charmer is my favorite drink on the menu - I've never seen another like it in my drinking career (lavender/chamomile infused gin, yellow chartreuse, lemon, & honey).  If you're a fan of whiskey/bourbon/rye/scotch, this place is for you!

My biggest complaint about the Village Whiskey in Philadelphia is that it's REALLY small inside, so if you have a big party (like 5+), don't even bother.  Even a party of three is usually squished in to a little table.  You'll have more luck getting a (comfortable) seat if it's nice and you can sit outside.

Next was the amuse bouche, a truffled mushroom soup, which was divine...except for the piece of glass in one of the party's serving, much to our dismay. When Matthew was alerted go the issue, he immediately apologized and gave her a drink on the house.

The escargot and salmon appetizers were excellent. They neglected to pull our plates prior to the main course, causing a delay in arrival  (and thus slightly cold entrées). The duck and lamb entrées were delicious, cooked perfectly. For dessert we enjoyed the apple tartin (very good) and proftieroles (decent).

Great ambiance, great server, decent food. The food service was just good, which I attribute to the kitchen, not our waiter. Likely not somewhere I'd go again, now that I've been.

I would recommend seating outside if the weather permits as it can get very noisy indoors.

We started with the Dips of the Day, which was amazing.   Warm pita with 3 excellent dips, one was lentil based, the other white bean based, and the third was fish roe based.  We were also served some nice soft bread with tahini dip which was complimentary and also very good.

I got the roasted rabbit leg, and my date got the suckling pig.  It was my first time having rabbit, but it was very good, like a deeper, more flavorful chicken.  It was over a bed of very tasty vegetables.

The suckling pig was also good but not my favorite.  I prefer a crispy texture, and it was more stew-like.  The flavors were good however, and it was topped with these amazing fried okras.  Both entrees were around $23 or so.  

We didn't have room for dessert but they did all sound amazing. 

The best part of the meal was our waiter, who was extremely friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and quick.  That, combined with the atmosphere, a good bottle of wine, and the interesting food made it one of the best dinner experiences I've had.

Pricey for sure, but definitely worth it. It's less crowded and busy than some of the other locations, and is located smack in the middle of UPenn's campus, with City Tap House, the Rave movie theater, and some other fantastic places nearby.

Capagiro has some of the most unique and awesome flavors that I've ever come across. As I write this review, I'm enjoying my pint of mixed grapefruit and papaya gelato. Unfortunately, it ran me over 11$, but I personally feel that it is ABSOLUTELY worth it. Just giving the warning, though.

Eggplant, this is what I ordered.  Very good, but it was no foie gras soup.

Gruyere popover is obviously a favorite at the table; crispy yet fluffy on the outside while being warm and cheesy inside.  Not too over powering in flavor but just right.  

Risotto was outstanding.  This was my favorite of the night.  The black truffles mixed with the crispy flake of what I believe is a parm crispy and some sort of squash puree (note i'm totally guessing, i just went to their menu online to confirm but their menu on their website is not up to date).

Meatloaf, mixed reviews, it was good but it wasn't meatloaf.  It was more of a light meatball with foie gras as the binding.  It was a nice take on meatloaf.

Lamb, I'm glad this is what i ordered.  I love lamb. It was very approachable.  The lamb itself was small, but perfectly cooked.  The lamb belly was new to me.  I liked it.  It's different than porkbelly but has all the same characteristics of 'a belly'. 

Gnocchi, very light and fully (as you would expect it to be) we ordered this for the table as we all wanted to try it.  I'd suggest the same to you.

As for drinks, the wine pair is the way to go.  I'd rather not think about what I want to drink.  For the actual wines themself, let me know what you think.

As for cocktails - la vie en rose was outstanding.  I took a picture of it so check it out.  I'd order that again anytime.

It did not taste authenticate to me at all. The refried beans tasted like canned beans, the rice had abosolutely no flavor and the burritos were slopped together like dog food. I was soooo disappointed, I really wanted to love it!

I started with the bruschetta ($4.50) with robiola due latti with saba-roasted strawberries.  The robiola is similar to a brie type cheese and the strawberries were roasted place on top of the cheese.  It was yummy, except the strawberries were a little too sweet or maybe a nuttier/saltier cheese would be a better pair.

The best thing I ate was the duck salad ($10) with seared duck, poached cherries, pistachios, grana podano, spinach and a citrus vinaigrette.  The duck was perfectly medium rare and just melted in my mouth.  It is nicely paired with the cherries and spinach.  The pistachios give it a nice crunchy texture.  Lastly the dressing is nice and tangy.  It was so delicious, I want to go back again.

I fondues with a nutella panini ($4) for dessert.  While anything with nutella is yummy, I would pass on this next time. Mostly because you can easily make this just as well at home.  Plus I was already full off of the bruschetta and salad.

I sat at the bar and although I quit drinking, I know the people working here know their stuff.  They were discussing the different wines and pairings. I was impressed.  Service was also stellar!  The waitress was very friendly, food came quickly, she always checked in with me, filled my water expeditiously and when I left she even said ""it was nice to meet you"".

Being on the service side of the table for many years, I'm extremely sensitive to customer service, and these guys excel at their game. I've had two different bartenders the times I've been (one boy, one girl, both of who offered their names, but for bad memory and potent beers, I can't remember), but each was unobtrusively affable and informative. It's such a pleasure to be at a place where those helping you really seem to care, and aren't just going through the motions of half-smiles and forced pleasantries that make it seem they're doing you the favor of allowing you to tip them. 

You can read the many other posts about the well-curated beer selection, the tasty food and the out of the way (read: comfort zone) location--rest assured that every word is true. The best testament of my love for this place is how far away I live, and how I go out of my way to return time after time.

Everything I had was kickass! Went on a Tuesday night with the boyfriend and walked into this pleasantly, modern farmhouse decorated joint. The lighting was very intimate and I could watch the chefs prepare everyone's dishes as I sat at my table. 

We started off with the blue duck fries. ($6) Soooo good. I never even realized that duck meat could be shredded and cooked so tender like that. The cheese sauce was a touch smokey and the fries had the right amount of salt and pepper, the green onion was the perfect touch of freshness; ughh so good. I had the taco of the night. ($19) It consisted of fried soft shell crab dredged with cornmeal & served on a flour tortilla with red cabbage, pickled asparagus and a touch of chopped tomatoes and onion. Delicious! My boyfriend had the pork roll burger. ($10) The meat blend in the burger was good. It was lean but rather juicy as well. The fried egg made it. Every bite was gooey and perfect.

I know that there are many restaurants run by Korean people who do not provide stellar service to those who don't speak to them in Korean. No prejudices here whatsoever. Much win.

I had the pajeon (vegetable pancake) and it was disastrous.  Now maybe you can fault me and say that when I go to a place called ""Bap,"" I should order the namesake bibimbap.  Ok, that's fair.  

On the other hand, if you can't adequately prepare a dish, don't offer it on your menu!  

This pajeon, a sort of egg+vegetable concoction, was tasteless, utterly without taste!  I couldn't even taste the vegetables that I could actually see in the pancake!  There also appeared to be something similar to cornmeal in the pancake.  

It was like eating fried construction paper.

rZneNaWxbMt3SZhQot1mfA,qfOftK3mWfauqNd9R-4xyQ,SIoCIxjn4jLt2O-4DajWJw,3,0,0,0,"A few months ago, I purchased a $40 dollar gift certificate for $20 on the Livingsocial website.  I do this from time to time because it serves as an excellent opportunity for me to try places that aren't on my usual list.  My wife and I headed down there this past Thursday night.  We found the place easily; it was located just west of 2nd and Market. 

The decor is that of your typical Philadelphia sports bar, with much of the wall decorations having been purchased at Model's.  The place was crowded, with every seat at the bar being taken.  We were able to find three high top tables near the front glass windows of the restaurant.  We grabbed the only one of the three that had two chairs (the others only having one each).  A few minutes after sitting down we noticed why the tables were vacant.  The glass windows made that whole area freezing.  I awkwardly pulled the table and chairs a few feet away from the window and under a heater.  

We waited a few minutes before a server stopped by our table with the menus and draft list.  The draft list was good. Beer snobs rejoice, this place has a very respectable list. My wife and I both went with one of our favorites, Troegs Mad Elf ($7.50).  The menu was also respectable. As vegetarians we went for the Mac's Mac-n-Cheese ($6.99), a Veggi Burger with mayo ($7.99 + $0.50) and  a Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($4.99) with fries ($5.99).  

The mac-n-cheese came out around 15-20 minutes after it was ordered, which I expected. Upon inspection, I noticed that it barely had any of those crushed BBQ chips the menu had mentioned.  Otherwise the dish was very good. The sauce was gooey and runny and after a quick stir all the pasta was once again coated in cheese sauce. I will certainly get this again should I return to Mac's. 

The entrees arrived in short time after the mac-n-cheese.  When I ordered my veggie burger, I asked the waiter if he had tired it and if it was any good. He responded ""that it was O.K. and that they came in pre-made"".  Slightly less optimistic, I decided to try it anyway. It was pretty good and scalding hot.  The role was definitely handmade and the burger had a chewy, crispy texture (in part b/c it was deep fried).  I was a little disappointed that the server charged me $0.50 for mayo without telling me.  The sandwich was supposed to come with a house aioli on it, but it didn't.  My wife's grilled cheese was impressive. The cheese, which was almost a half inch thick, had been broiled to get a crispy, brown, bubbly texture before the sandwich was finished and sliced. Her small side of fries, which she requested as an add on for her sandwich was ($5.99) bringing her grilled cheese and fries to a whopping $11. 

I wasn't overly impressed with Mac's! Other than a few puns on their menu, I would never have guessed that the place was at all affiliated with the show (I'm a big Always Sunny fan!).  Without the show as a novelty, I was left with yet another pretentious gastropub in Old City.  I might return to Mac's if a friend visits the city and wants to go because they watch the show. But the food, beer and atmosphere are better elsewhere.",2011-01-15 16:19:51,

Normally, I would order their burger and never look back. Unfortunately, my girlfriend recently accused me of eating four burgers a week, which is completely absurd. OK, so MAYBE I had already eaten three that week, but I would NEVER eat four. What sort of glutton eats four burgers a week? 

In any case, since I would rather be unhappy than allow her to be right, I went with the crabcake sandwich on the bartender's recommendation. When it finally arrived, the accompanying sweet potato fries were barely cooked, but the sandwich itself tasted pretty good. The crabcake fell apart (as crabcakes are wont to do), but I bet they make a good burger, which I'll have to come back and try when I haven't reached my weekly quota.

Now, Bridgewater's doesn't look like much. The food is a little better than decent, and their flatscreens could use some updating to HD (you want to be able to see the pain on Favre's face). But this is the best train station bar in existence, and I'll tell you why: their beer selection is shockingly awesome. You'd never expect to find so many great beers available in a train station. It's even updated seasonally. Right now, they have all sorts of Christmas ales.

But WOW, what an excellent and pleasant surprise!  The food was really terrific.   Here's our rundown:
* Empanada's were delicious, if a bit overfried.  A lighter touch with the oil would make them more appealing.
* Seafood Soup:  Amazing.  Really, really delicious, with tons of seafood in it.  A nice smoky flavor.  Four thumbs up.
* Duck Mole: pretty good, but not great. Wasn't a great cut of duck & it was drowned in mole, which overpowered the duck.  A little mole goes a long way - a better presentation on this dish, with less mole would have been better.  The sausage/beans side was delicious mixed with the salty rice.

Favourite Appetisers-dumplings in chilli oil. Favourite Entrees-chicken in hot sauce style, eggplant in garlic sauce, dry pepper chicken. I also recently tried a pork dish with celery-and it was pretty delicious. Also worth trying are the three cup chicken, fried chinese cabbage, and cumin lamb.

First of all, the restaurant in general is uncomparable. The food is contemporary asian fusion. It's exquisite and simple delicious. Modernized and presentation is just the best out of all of chinatown. It's not really an all just chinese restaurant like the others, but it's fusion with a mix of everything at its best with authenticity. The interior design with a mix of lounge and a full size bar where you can sit down on is all amazing. Whether you want to have a full size dinner, which they have an extra dining room for the big crowds, or to just drink and chill like a sports bar, they got it all. Their seating is all around and plus they have stairs to an upstairs section, so you won't have to wait. But if you do, the bar is right at your service right away, with my hot friend serving you the best tasting drinks and a very cheap affordable price.

Food - I recommend they're well known for - Duck Dumplings are absolutely delicious. I believe they're the only one that sells them, and if you like duck, you'll certainly fall in love with theirs.
With a combo of Vietnamese food - which is authentic marinated and made by her mom, you can't go anywhere else to have a flavorful vietnamese dish and pork chops at an affordable price.
Thai food - Pad thai is authentic and the way it should taste. just YUMMY!
Salads - FRESH and the best tasting salad i ever had.
Lamp chops - marinated and absolutely delicious, it was my first time and I loved them.
Desserts - with a combo of yummy dessert choices, they have it all. 
Pricing for food, which is expected, the fine dining is a bit pricey and the other Asian cuisines are around what you expect, good price for good food.

Drinks - Very cheap and very affordable price and made like how drinks are supposed to be. Very delicate in how they make it and experts too. They don't hire amatures and they are certainly well trained professional hot bartenders. They will make your drink at their own pace to make you savor your drink and make you want more. My hot friend introduced me to my all time favorite drink, Kaola bear. Next time you go there, ask Tammy for one, you'll fall in love with it, THAT IS IF you like a banana flavored milkshake liquor. If you're stuck on a drink, she will come up with one and recommend you some of her great made own drinks, which I believe have been presented in some magazines and she herself have celebrity bartend at other places in philly. (and that's because she's the bestest bartender of them all! love that gal, and you will too! )

Very friendly atmosphere with servers and all of their workers in a very presentable and friendly manner. Got a topic? You'll be there days talking about it. People usually come and sit and chill at the bar, which everybody comes for an watch either from football games, basketball, miss universe, and even watch the olympics. They're so friendly, you'll feel like home.

On the weekends, they have DJ nights to make it more welcoming for everybody to enjoy, have a drink, and clear out the dining area for a dancefloor. It's not for a clubbing atmosphere, so I don't think it's very popular for the clubbers to enjoy because of it's remote location on 11th st in chinatown. However, it's a huge hit for everybody to just chill and drink, especially for the older audience 21+ that doesn't have itch to be dancing or be bothered with 18+ in a 21+ club, so Ly Michaels is the spot to chill and enjoy the night with a friend or two and relax at a loungey feeling.

Ly Michaels is definitely a to-go place if you're around the area and just want a drink away from the office before you go home. Open at 3ish til 2am, you might as well call it your 2nd home. I recommend it for anybody who also goes to the convention center which is right across the street and for anybody who is stayin at the Hilton which is down the corner. It's a mix environment and friendly atmosphere and welcome all types of diversity, they'll make you feel welcomed at Ly Michael.",2008-09-30 18:16:34,

But back to the food, which is what matters. The place is reasonably priced and the food is great--Korean comfort food. It's not good for you, but if you want that, go to a real Korean place and get something full of veggies. 

At Southgate, get the quintuply fried wings (KFC) that are truly terrific in Korean hot sauce (gochujang). Pass on the pork belly buns--they are ok but nothing to Yelp© about. The autumn salad was very nice, too.

Korean tacos look like they're going to be a problem with the meat smothered in what appears to be a cream sauce of some sort, but actually the sauce is quite light and the tacos are terrific. For me the star was the Bulgogi burger, which I'm still thinking of weeks later... Not the right cuisine descriptor, but it's the most ""umami"" thing you'll ever eat. Spiced like bulgogi with the real deal trimmings and a great soft bun. Really fantastic and highly recommended. 

Go here and don't look back and enjoy. A fun and inventive restaurant with great food and service--enough that you can ignore everyone else and have a good and unhealthy meal with a friend.",2015-11-24 04:49:15,

If you are in the Philadelphia area and want Latin food, this place is a must. The place is cozy and very clean. The staff was very warm, friendly, and attentive.

We ate in the 6025 W. Valley Green RD location, I had never been to before. NEAT!

The blue cheese salad w/u'r self fixing table was superb. Fresh sliced sirloin, sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions, mashed taters, and carrots were sooooo good. They had a pasta bar that I couldn't even get to, 

I was so filled with their PERFECT preparation.

Desert was the best chocolate bread pudding I EVER had, Why? I hate bread pudding. This was crunchy on top, soft and gooey inside but not mushy (yuch) and OH SOOO GOOOD dark chocolate inside. With vanilla ice cream, home made?? and outstanding coffee and mints. 

Not to mention the cocktail was tops. AND, we had appetizer table with a great assortment of cheeses, fruit, mustards, and special crackers. I don't often give 5 stars....this was great!

I decided to bring a friend coming into town taking a break from her practice/relaxing and excited for the experience. (Not to mention my husband and myself telling her she would not be disappointed) 
The food was great, per usual. The issue was with the service. When we first arrived I explained that we needed to have a pizza to go for my husband who did not attend with us. The response we got was ""Sure. I'll make sure to put that in last so it's nice and hot for you. The pizzas cook quickly"". Perfect. 
Continue to order and realize that she never got to try the chick peas that are complimentary but delicious. No big deal. It's chickpeas.
Come to the end of the meal, I ask about the togo pizza. The response was ""Oh. The kitchens leaving now"" Super frustrating considering I was told the order would be placed at the beginning of the meal. Not please remind me at the end of the meal, nothing. But even more frustrating to be treated like we waited until the last minute to place an order when this was the first thing mentioned.  Had there been some sense of accountability the situation would have been alleviated. It got busy, anything. Instead the server just avoided the table, not wanting to deal with us anymore. 
Will we stop going? No! The food is awesome, as are the drinks. Seriously! nothings a bad choice. The server just had a lackadaisical attitude towards us and it was ""eh"" on that end. Every other experience here has been outstanding otherwise. (And I'll remind the server if we order to go again and I need to go food.

I think the white rice is better than brown - it's stickier - but having the option is a plus.
