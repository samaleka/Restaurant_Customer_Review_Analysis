Table: 
We were seated at a 4 seater table right next to the front door, host counter and bar, which not only kept getting blasted with cold air every 10 seconds, but guests were bumping into my friend's chair throughout the night, physically interrupting his meal, and staff using his chair as a hand rail as they brushed by our table. 

We noticed when we first walked in, that we would undoubtedly be seated at this table by the door, and when we asked the hostess if we could have another table and wait for it, we received an unapologetic response that they were booked solid and that is the table for us. As someone who works in a client service profession, the response should never be no, but what can I do to resolve this, even if it means agreeing to an unconventional solution to accommodate the customer/client's concern. 

Staff/Service: 
After being seated at our table, almost 15 mins went by without a single person coming by to greet us, take drinks orders or even apologize for the delay in service. It wasn't until the hostess noticed us looking around that she called someone over to take our drink orders. Our waiter, as apologetic as he was about the unfortunate table and staff, couldn't make up for the poor experience we had throughout the night. His comped prosecco and cheese plate service was appreciated but not everyone at my table enjoyed the prosecco so it was a bit of a wasted gesture. As my friend said, it would have been more helpful if he asked us first what he could do to improve our situation instead of attempting to resolve it in his own way, but we appreciated his gesture and concern, as he was the only staff that night that seemed keen on attempting to fix our broken experience.

Food: 
Expected to be blown away by the courses to make up for the bad table and service but each course was just decent, nothing truly exceptional, except for the key lime dessert. My friend even had the unfortunate incident of having something inedible on his surf & turf plate, but besides that, all the other courses were just fine. Had better tasting menus at lesser known restaurants, so again, based on their reputation, our meal experience did not live up to it.

Net, my friends and I felt that the restaurant was just trying to get things done haphazardly and crammed way too many tables and reservations in that Saturday night, without any real concern for providing excellent customer service. 

From the distracted, aloof staff, poor table placements to less than mind-blowing food, I would not recommend this place. If anything, just grab a seat by the bar or order the key lime dessert as take out if you can.",2013-11-14 22:49:50,"{'food': ['surf & turf', 'key lime dessert'], 'drink': []}"

Every trip I make to Las Vegas, NV, I make it a point to eat there multiple times. So yesterday when returning to Philadelphia from a quick weekend trip home, I thought I'd treat myself to a quick sandwich before I was picked up from the airport. 

I ordered my regular Veggie Sandwich and although it was still tasteful and delicious it was different from the version I typically get in the Las Vegas Planet Hollywood casino.

I'm not too familiar with Philly, but the bar flanked parts of Chinatown and seemed to be in a part of town that was a bit rough-around-the -edges, so finding this cool spot in such a unlikely locale made it ever more of a sweet find. From the vintage sign outside to the wrought iron mustang carved enclosures that meet you at the front entrance, a subtlely hip James Dean appeal imbued the Prohibition.  The vibe, beer, and service did not disappoint, so I expected their grub to live up. I was excited to see their pickle plate as an app and ordered it on a whim. Luscious looking carrots and cocktail onions and green beans came out on an equally verdant and zesty looking bed of fresh lettuce, but after my second bite I realized that looks can be deceiving. Let's just say this app tasted more like a vinegar plate than a pickled veg plate.  The veggie sandwich tasted overly seasoned and a few bites in, I couldn't even finish it.  I almost would have rather they served a Boca Burger and least gotten something somewhat tasty for my money. And then a quarter of the way through our sandwich, a slightly off cook (the head cook?) came out from the kitchen and kept offering the bartenders food, only to be turned down.

I think the first time I tried this place, it may have been in part because the line at Dinic's was unbearably long and the throngs of people waiting were spilling over into Beck's stall space (they are next to each other)... and boy am I glad my inner fatty couldn't wait another minute because I just don't know what I'd do without this jumbalaya! 

I will note that the service here is a bit terrible. Don't get me wrong - everyone is very nice, but ... SLOW-moving. VERY slow moving. I have never seen a more inefficient operation in my life, but like I said, they are super pleasant and helpful so you forgive them for taking 10+ minutes to pack  your order and collect payment (note: I've been there at least 4x and it's been true every single time). 

As an example of the employees' niceness/helpfulness, as an FYI, they do let you sample pretty much any of the entrees so you can make sure it's not too spicy or too peppery etc for you.

Also, no credit card machine here so bring CASH.

WHAT WE ATE
*Jumbalaya: perfect. perfect. AND it's surprisingly spicy! It's less saucy then some jumbalayas I have had, but still really flavorful and the rice is perfectly cooked. They also usually spoon on a bit of sauce on top and adds that extra flavor. IF you get the right cashier, she will upsell you the cornbread - GET IT - and eat it TOGETHER. They're not messing around when they say the cornbread + jumbalaya flavors complement each other like whoa.  

*Etouffee - the flavors of the bell peppers were a bit TOO strong for my personal liking, but I could appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the spiciness here as well. My friends really liked this dish, so I did want to mention. 

*Oyster Po'Boy - I thought the fried oyster was great. The breading they use to coat the po boy sandwich meats (and oysters) are really tasty and not overwhelming. I wish there was more oyster in the sandwich itself, but that would be the only complaint. 

*Beignets - warm and delightfully light fried dough and generous dusting of powdered sugar make this dessert just decadent enough. 

*Praline cookies - these were decent, but not the best I've ever had. The color was a bit darker than I was used to (more coffee with a splash of milk rather than latte color) and it almost tasted like they had burned/overcooked the butter or brown sugar.

She brought our menus over and just put them on the table, rolled her eyes and walked away. No smile, nothing. What a horrible start of our meal. Then the same thing happened to the couple who sat next to us where the couple said thank you for bringing the menus and she walked away without saying anything or smiling!

every dish was excellent, and even artistic!  I had the avocado ceviche, barbacoa (perfectly cooked), and chocolate souffle cake with cajeta ice cream.

I think I ordered roti cani, but I can't be sure. Definitely some sort of Indian chili chicken which was delish -- the sauce was a fascinating blend of red curry, brown sugar and about 15 other spices I can't put my finger on.

I eschewed a side dish in favor of 2 desserts -- the peanut pancakes, which look and taste exactly as you'd imagine and the falooda/faluda, one of the single most delicious, creatively concocted beverages a have ever had the pleasure of slurping down in 40 seconds. This thing is traditionally made from mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, sweet basil (sabza/takmaria) seeds, and pieces of jelly with milk, often topped off with a scoop of ice cream.

Sounds bizarre. Google it and see. It's okay, I'll wait.

Very friendly staff / Our waitress was wonderful
Food was delicious. I had the caesar salad, short ribs & chocolate financier for dessert.  The short ribs literally melted in my mouth!
My husband & I split the shrimp cocktail which included only 3 but they were very large. These were good , wasn't crazy about the cocktail sauce.
He ordered the house salad with balsamic - equal to or even tastier than the tangy Caesar. For an entree he enjoyed the flounder paella style- which not only included rice but also clams, mussels & calamari. He devoured it in minutes :)
I forget the name is his dessert but there was mellon & a type of sherbet or pudding in the center. 
The meal is served with a seasoned bread & creamy butter. 
They also have a very nice lounge area surrounding the bar for an after or before dinner cocktail. There were people eating some apps there as well.

I prefer to go there when I can get an outside table, or when I visit with a particular group of friends who also share in my sentiment of fondness. Now what the heck took me so long to experience Zorba's delivery?! Shame on me. It's the same delicious food, just in my pajamas in front of my TV. 

Having experienced a day that could only be fixed by delivery, my husband handled all of the order details. I believe he placed directly with them, as we were able to pay in cash when the delivery guy arrived. The wait time was standard- I don't recall it arriving early nor do I recall being antsy about its whereabouts. 

I'm no stranger to the Imam Baldi. I think every time I have this eggplant in red sauce soufflé, I go on the record that this dish can turn me into a vegetarian. It came with the standard sides of rice, veggies and potatoes, all separated by little dividers as to not mingle. 

We were first timers to the Skordalia. Think extra, extra whipped mashed potatoes with extra, extra garlic. Move over (already fabulous hummus), you may have just been replaced in our repertoire. Okay, I kid. We'll just get both and have leftovers.

Speaking of leftovers, we totally were able to split our order into two meals. Score!

8hN0CYu2FXSQKthJiydHsg,ximZB2ooy66sEusKVVwvqA,eaDZlSuVS0EY67Ke6pRP6Q,4,3,0,1,"Very accommodating!

I say this because I ate here last week, which was not to long ago, for a friend's birthday. There were about 7 of us, total. I called twice to change the reservation time, and they were very polite about it.

We were worried about not being able to eat here because we found out one of my friends has a peanut allergy. Knowing the way Asian restaurants work, a lot of them use peanut oil or peanut products in their food.

Three people that worked there came up to our table to listen to our orders to make sure that they got it right, and to omit any peanuts in the dishes. I believe one of them might have been the manager. If that isn't good service, I don't know what is!

We ordered the roti canai (indian pancake), shrimp puff, young chow fried rice, hainanese chicken, sizzling beef, shrimp pad thai, deep fried shrimp with ginger soy sauce.

The roti is probably their most famous dish. Once you try it you'll know why. As soon as we sat down I asked if we could order an appetizer to start (since everyone was hungry and it was already 8pm). She asked if I wanted roti and how many, before I could even ask what I wanted. How'd she know? Two please!

The shrimp puff was so delicious! I'm warning you though to let it sit for a bit and give it 5 minutes. It is served HOT and WILL burn your tongue. The sauces tend to squirt out into your mouth as soon as you bite into it, which is no fun when it's extremely hot! Wait it out and you'll thank me later. The sauce was a nice touch to the shrimp puff. Very cohesive appetizer. You should definitely try this one.

Fried rice was average, as any Asian restaurant's fried rice is.

Hainanese chicken was very different ... never had anything like it. It's completely baked but served at room temperate so it gives off the feeling that it's being served ""cold"". It's actually pretty good with the soy sauce (which is served under the chicken) if you can get over the way it looks and the cold texture. We we're actually served a piece that was still blue and looked like a cyanotic chicken extremity which turned me off completely, even being in the medical field. Shivers. We decided just to set it aside and remove it so we wouldn't have to look at it anymore.

The sizzling beef was absolutely.. FORGETTABLE. Do not get this dish. It lacked flavor, and did not come out sizzling. Womp, womp.

The pad thai is also just an average dish. Nothing too special going on, probably would not get it again since I could get better pad thai elsewhere.

Now I saved the best part for last.. the deep fried fish! It normally comes with other sauces, but we requested to do a simple ginger and soy sauce. This is the best fried fish, ever! We all couldn't get our hands off it and fought for the last morsel! Main reason it was so good was because it was so crispy! Good to share due to it's size. Fairly big. I would totally go back for this.

I received the tickets for the ""Double Happiness: Sushi & Dim Sum Class"" as a birthday gift. We got there early (get there early!) and we were wonderfully surprised that it was just us and one other couple (so, we had LOTS of hand-on training).

First, we were shown the kitchen and Chef Poon told us lots of stories. Chef Poon is fascinating and if you take the effort to really listen to him, he's quite entertaining! His Sous Chef was a pleasure to talk to, too!

Then we learned how to make the dumplings. I had no idea there were SO many kinds. We made quite a few and he allowed me to fry a batch. Yum. Really, very tasty!

Then... it was SUSHI TIME...!

We stood at the table and made TONS of such. All kinds: a seaweed cone, with caviar, rice on the inside, rice on the outside with trays and trays of fish, shrimp, vegetable and more.

And, we're eating as we are making them! Still, we had SO MUCH food left over... I took home FIVE TRAYS of amazing sushi! (So much that when I brought them to my mom's the next day, we still couldn't finish them!!)

So, we started packing up the food and Chef Poon motions us to a table... where he prepared DINNER! Steak, General Joe's Chicken (yum!!), a tasty salad and our dumplings.

Truly, it was so delicious, but I needed to bring it home. I was stuffed! (I had it on Monday and it was extraordinary.)

THEN, because it was my birthday, he brought out a cake that he bought for me! I mean... that was so nice. (Thanks, Chef!)

==========

That said... for $120 a person you get a LOT. Entertainment, two classes and a ton of food!

I read some of the 1-star reviews and they are nitpicking on some things. (The price of the fish, compared to the price of the class. That's just silly. You're paying for world-class knowledge and FUN.)

My husband and I went the Friday before V-Day (that's Valentine's Day, gutter-brains), and we really didn't know what to expect aside from guaranteed truffle oil (we know our Daniel Stern).

After a slightly awkward ascent via the elevator with a couple who looked like they might be going up to the 37th floor to push each other out the window, we arrived at a fairly fab, glam-but-not-overdone space that was obviously fancy but not so fancy that I wished I'd broken out the fur.

We waited at the bar and had a couple ""eh"" house speciality cocktails (something manhattan-ish... something else wtih gin...not memorable, obvi), followed by a couple glasses of wine.  I remember the eye candy who served my drinks more than what I had.  Gorgeous girls behind the bar and in the cocktail area.  When we were ushered to our table, we finally checked out the menu and saw at least 40 things we wanted to try, so we thought it over while snacking on olive loaf and sourdough bread - both amazing.

For starters, we ordered the warm spinach salad (I think it was served with pate?) with poached egg.  It was to die for -- perfect amount of egginess, great presentation all around.  I ordered the lobster roll (lobster roll with a hint of lavender!!) on house-made brioche, which came with chips and some other cute little lobster-tentacle-esque garnish.  I seriously housed this lobster roll, and hoarded it so that my husband couldn't have any.  Happy Valentine's day, baby.  F-ign unreal.

Main course... My husband ordered the salmon, which was poached in olive oil and probably the single best piece of salmon I've ever eaten.  I was SO JELLY over his order.  I had the flatbread with arugula and truffle oil (see earlier reference in part one of this food novella), and a side of broccoli, which somehow was the best broccoli I've ever eaten.  Someone obviously crushed pretty hard on the broc while they were making it, because it was unreal and just so delicate... Yes, I just reviewed a side of broccoli. For realsies.

Dessert (yeah, we went there) was beignets, and this crazed garbanzo bean cookie topped with poached pears and honey ice cream.  Our server brought out some delicious honey-related (I say related because I don't know if it was infused or how it got there) cognac to pair it with.  I had one of those ""food moments"" where I was like... You know what?  I'm okay with everything in life right now and I would like to have the Chef's love child in the very near future.

It taste more like a bland Indian dish which I have never had. The spices were there but there was no salt. The dosa was mushy. It was disgusting! 

Next stop K-TOWN KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN: $8 for 4 chicken wings supposedly cooked Korean Style. Save your time and your money and go straight to Cafe Soho! The wings were breaded and there was more breading than chicken. What a let down. 

Then on to THE COW AND THE CURD: $14 for gloriFRIED cheese and a frozen lemonade. It was a fancier version of a mozzarella stick. Sadly enough this is what I enjoyed the most.

You have to knock on the door to be let in, and the inside is gorgeous. Dimly lit, the walls are lined with tapestries.

You almost feel as if you were invited into someone's home. A belly dancer even came out in the middle of our meal! 

We went pretty early on a Saturday night, so the fact that we didn't have a reservation wasn't a problem. We went about 5-5:30 and it was completely empty, but it started to really fill up around 7, so if you are going later make a reservation.

The mac and cheese was soooo good. I usually do not like mac and cheese unless it is homemade at restaurants because it just tastes flavorless and salty.

If you have read my other reviews on yelp, you know I have tried several different Indian restaurants, so I'm very familiar with the cuisine and what to expect.
What I like about Mumbai Bistro:
1) The prices -- most affordable Indian food. If you're on a budget like me, this is perfect.
2) Simple, easy-to-understand menu. It also tells you what's spicy, what's gluten free, what contains dairy.
3) Fast service. Even if you don't call in and order ahead for take-out, they get your to-go order ready in 5-10 mins.

Everyone has a favorite steak shop or two and they can be as different as night and day. White House, Tony Luke's, Geno's, Pudge's - like comparing apples and pigs, or Wilt to Magic, or Kung Fu to Karate, you just can't compare iconic examples different styles.

Larry's is like that. I've been coming for 30 years. Once or twice, I even stepped up to the Houseway Belly Filler. I think this was the first place I ever had a meat topping on a steak sandwich (pepperoni), but it wasn't the last. 

What makes Larry's Larry's? First, the guy is cooking in the window. Next, the steaks are chopped. Not shredded, fluffed, laid out or shingled. Even the toppings on our chicken cheese steak hoagie were chopped - a devout nod to every-bite-the-same sandwich science. A lot of work goes into every steak. Finally, the fresh Amoroso-style roll is just a little toasted, not enough to be a grinder, but certainly not steamed on the grill like an AC sub. 

When on Hawk Hill and hungry go to Larry's. Is it the best steak ever? Nah, but it is an institution and true to itself. As you take your first bite, envision yourself bustin curfew on the way home from seeing Neil Young at the Spectrum, or watching the Sixers take the NBA crown, or sweating whether Y2k will crash your Palm II. If you twist my arm, Larry's doesn't crack my top 5, but tradition is tradition, and Larry's has stood the test of time for good reason.",2011-04-23 18:46:55,"{'food': ['steak sandwich', 'meat topping', 'chicken cheese steak hoagie'], 'drink': []}"

The sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.

The breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.

The meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.

What my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.

I would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food, but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars, but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments.",2015-08-07 04:59:42,"{'food': ['chicken fingers', 'wings', 'mac and cheese', 'pastries'], 'drink': []}"

The food itself was pretty mediocre. The boy and I did a weekend-long food tour of Philly and this was stop #65 or so, so we weren't extremely hungry coming in.

Hole in the wall? Whatever. It's so good! This was my first time trying afghani food and it was a very pleasant experience. I really like the ambiance. The cultural decorations are pretty fun. The artwork is pretty, if you have an appreciation for that kind of stuff. This restaurant is like a mini museum! 

The food was descent. The fish was light and yummy. It was too dry. I used the spicy, tangy sauce to add a little more flavor. The lamb was also pretty decent. It was nicely flavored and the gamey taste was subtle.

Positives - Creative menu. The waiter was very polite and attentive. Drinks were great (nice Bourbon cocktails).  Beer selection was also good. Prices are reasonable. 

Negatives - Most of the food was poorly done, despite a very long wait time. Every one in our party complained about the over use of salt. The fried chicken was inedible due to the salt and funky taste in the batter (something was definitely off). The waiter apologized but made no effort to remedy the issue.  The chicken was left untouched on the plate. The bacon used on the grilled cheese and burgers had too much fat. The sweet potato fries were overly cooked.

Awful coffee. Just awful.

Maybe that's not fair. I have yet to sample all of their fare, and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end, they call themselves a cafe, which translates into a coffee shop, moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu, so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.

They were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described, they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu, and they were out of all of it, which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava, but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them, so even experimenting is a horrible idea.

There was a small child running around screaming, and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy, but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect, it would have detracted from the experience

And...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it, and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel, and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day, and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who, during his broke college days, would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape, and I couldn't finish it. Seriously, it was that bad. I don't know how they did it, and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.

Maybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe, their Mediterranean food is really good, as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery, and have great falafel, they should do that. But dear God in heaven, who I have forsaken in so many ways, they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked.

We had sampled the shrimp and grits which were very good when scouting the place but the cheesy grits I had on that date
Did not compare - however the rest of the food - including sausage , bacon , eggs and pancakes was yummy .  I wish their pastries included some kind of iced cinnamon roll mostly because that's a favorite of mine but also because it would have been more festive than the small muffins which were a
Bit dry - the glazed donut/ roll was good though .  The only real issue was that the drink station - serve themselves coffee and hot water in thermal vessels and juices plus champagne to make mimosas - was not out until about 30 minutes after guests arrived -- and the juice carafes were very small - almost like what you'd place on one table so kept needing refill ( I think when it appears like there is only a small amount guests will be influenced to not tAke much out of politeness so should look plentiful ) also twice when I went for coffee it was empty -- although they did refill it when asked .  
The staff was very pleasant - the bartender was helpful and good about our taking up his entire bar top .  
I'd highly recommend this as a party venue or just as a good brunch place",2018-05-29 00:59:01,"{'food': ['sausage', 'bacon', 'eggs', 'pancakes'], 'drink': ['coffee', 'hot water', 'juices', 'champagne', 'mimosas']}"

We placed our order or tried at first. My friend repeated the order three times.  The repeated her card number 2 times.  Then became tired of repeating my address.  I gave them my address the 4th time.  We were told we'd get our Indian goodness in 30 - 45 minutes.  Not a problem.  We were fine with waiting.  We thought the repeating-ourselves-thing was pretty comical until...

Over an hour later we had no Indian goodness.  We called the restaurant.  We let them know the time frame they gave us and that it was well past that time frame.  The person on the phone didn't seem to understand ""we've been waiting over an hour.  Can you tell us if the driver is near?""  Several times.  This time the repetition wasn't comical.

The food, mediocre.  Before to night I was fine with waiting to get it on the latter end of the stated time.

It's still down a dark alley off of South Street and in a house (the owners' house) Things have slightly changed- Marrakesh is still dim, and served as a 5-course eat-with-your-hands dinner family style, (as if in Morocco)  surrounded by tons of Middle Eastern decor- runs, lamps, the works. The servers are the owners- a couple who loves to keep it traditional. 

I called ahead for seating at 8pm but it seems as though we could have just walked in- we ate upstairs.  You have to ring the bell to get in. We came on Sunday but it was relatively busy- downstairs was full but upstairs not so much. Maybe it was because we were upstairs...but I felt service lacked a bit (we had to ask for water a few times, etc but I couldn't hold it against the one server- the wife). On Fri and Sat, there are belly dancers. 

If you're new to this kind of thing, they do a good job explaining the process. First, they ran your hands through soapy water from their majestic-looking teapot. Next, they explain the menu and ask you to choose between 1 or 2 course for dishes 3 and 4. You don't have a lot of flexibility.. so I am not sure how vegetarians would fare. 

We ate:

1) Course 1- three salads: picked carrots, cucumbers and an eggplant puree- like a babaganoush. This was very tender, salty and good- the others were not as fancy but very tasty. A large tangine looking thing comes around for you to grab pita. The pita is ok- it's not warm, it's not fluffy but you can't win them all (and it's important not to fill up too much on this)

2) Course 2- Very interesting kind of Moroccan...quiche? It's basically a flaky pastry topped with confectioner's sugar that houses egg, chicken, nuts...and some other things. It was overwhelmingly eggy, but tasty. Not my favorite dish but had to give it points for creativity and uniqueness.  The flaky dough was delish- very similar to that of the Green Spinach Pie.

3) Course 3- was our choice between two chicken (chicken with lemon olive oil or spicy cumin)- of course we did spicy cumin! It was fall right off the bone- so tender as I'm sure it was slow cooked for hours. It's also half a chicken so you get the breast, thigh and wing. The sauce was not too spicy, I thought, but the cumin flavor is smoky and present. The sauce is pretty slathered across the meat- and yes you can refill up on pita if you're not into eating meat solo. 

4) Course 4- is a choice between beef or lamb and since I don't do red meat, I passed on this. My bf ordered the lamb though and said it was very tender and yummy- and sweet. It was topped with almonds and something else that made it sweet. 

5) Course 5- Dessert!  You get fresh fruit and baklava (one piece each). Usually I think baklava is too sweet for me but this one was pretty good- and not too oily. I mean, yes, it was very oily but it wasn't like...drenched in oil. It was pretty flat, cripsy and full of that nutty goodness that you make baklava. Bf said it wasn't nutty enough for him. Again, the flaky dough wins. 

The fresh fruit was also a plus- except our apple was bruised so we didn't eat that. We took our orange for breakfast the next day. There were two strawberries (not really regional, ha) and giant seedless grapes that were almost frozen because it the fruit platter came with a chunk of ice. This was almost like a cornucopia..they really do make you feel like emperor and empress haha!

The meal is well paced (slow) so you have time to breathe.  They sell only a few house wines by the glass; otherwise you get it by the bottle (there are a few varieties at $30 ish, as well as liquor and the like). My bf got two glasses of red wine- the burgandy. It was actually fruity and full of body, which was a plus. I ordered the traditional rose drink which I actually wouldn't recommend- it was really, really sweet. It was like rose syrup (sweet enough), with sugar and water..it was too sweet and at $5, I was upset I couldn't finish it. 

This place accepts cash only and is $25 per person. I feel the menu could get old since you don't have variety but it's definitely a must-try while in Philly.",2012-05-29 00:45:19,

What you are really paying for is the view here. While we didn't lay down a $200 deposit to guarantee a window seat, we did get one. I think this was because we ate so early on a Sat evening (5:30pm reservations). We were seated on the West side and the sun was setting. Fortunately I had my sunglasses with me although they did offer to pull down the shades for me as well. The views were definitely lovely but it likely would have been better had we gone later in the evening when the lights of the city were coming alive. 

Service was excellent throughout the entire meal. Our waitress took good care of my wife who is gluten free. We asked her what a few of the roads/bridges were that we were looking at, but she sort of guessed at it. You would thinking working there they would be required to know the more major landmarks out there. Oh well.

As for the food, that's what left me disappointed. I started with the Steakhouse Salad. I guess I just assumed there would be some meat in it, but sadly, there was none to be found. There were quite a few olives in there and unfortunately I'm not an olive fan, so ultimately I wasn't able to finish the salad. My wife's roasted shrimp though wasn't bad.

For entrees, I got veal medallions with mozzarella and prosciutto in a mushroom sauce and my fiancée got their stuffed calamari in linguine.

And they do a different special sandwich every week;which has consiquently bumped me from a semi-regular customer up to a once or twice a week reg. 
Service is friendly from the cashier to the fry guys to Josh and his happy helpers in the back. They're always helpful and enjoy chit chat and quick jokes. They seem to genuinely enjoy their job and social interaction. It's always fun to catch them jamming out to the eclectic rock station always playing for ambiance. Just a chill group of guys n gals.
I don't want to call the space SMALL because it doesn't feel cramped. It's more like its interactive and fitting for a fast-moving burger joint. Think diner meets pizza place meets local bar type of feel. Low rise tables in front for relaxing, some hightops with a different perspective in the corner, and the bar-style counter make it so u can pick your style comfort. With paintings and articles all over, you're bound to have some conversation pieces nearby as well.
Everything seems clean. From tables floors and counters, to the separate area in the back for butchering meets, to the clearly labeled bins for different trash and recyclables.

Originally, we were impressed by the reviews on Yelp and we had passed it a couple of times when we were dining in that area before. I was actually looking forward to dining here...when we arrived, we were seated quickly. There was one other table with customers but they were just leaving. The staff was standing at the bar watching/cheering a game on a tv over the bar. 

Our server was friendly but seemed distracted. We ordered the crawfish dip, a couple of beers, buttermilk chicken sandwich, mac n cheese, and the chocolate cake for dessert. The appetizer took about 20 mins. to arrive...they did eventually come out to tell us something was wrong with the oven and they would remove it from our check out of courtesy. We were then served our meals and about 15 mins later, our appetizer arrived. 

The buttermilk chicken sandwich: the chicken itself was soggy and/or very greasy, the kale or greens on the sandwich were soggy from being soaked in honey or grease maybe?? It looked unpleasant. Normally, greasy wouldn't be so bad with a nice crunch. This didn't have that. The mac n cheese had a good smokey flavor from the bacon. The crawfish dip had good flavor as well...very cheesy and tangy. The bread it came with was toasted and slightly burnt around the edges. It was hard to chew or cut. Before we were asked if we wanted dessert, our server brought us the check. Maybe he wanted us to leave so that they can all continue watching the game without interruption, but it was strange. We asked if we can order dessert and he took our order. The chocolate cake was dense...a huge portion that was good for sharing. Not sure if the cake was stale or just hard from being refrigerated but it was hard to cut with a knife. I actually thought it might be frozen but it wasn't.  It had good flavor though. 

So, it wasn't a horrible experience but with all the dining options in and around Philly, we will not be returning even if it was an off night for them.

Walking in I almost felt like ET when the government comes in and throws him on a table in the blue tent. It was so bright in there I felt like all my blemishes and insecurities would be exposed. It's a very big store, much larger than other froyo places in the city and is well equipped to feed the masses in the dead of summer. 

When I walked to the counter the girl working there was very friendly and gave me a few suggestions which I didn't take and I actually went for the Tres Leche which is coconut and dulce de leche mixed. I got a medium with carob chips on top and it came out over $6. I expected to pay a lot  just because that seems to be the theme of Phila yogurt shops. What was interesting is that they whipped the yogurt once it was in the cup to make it seem bigger. I thought this was kinda weird, I'd rather have some dense yogurt than something light and airy but whatev.

The flavor was really good. Not mind blowing but really good. What I really liked most about is that it's all organic and they don't use high fructose corn syrup. That is extremely important to me. Most places don't use hormone treated diary so that was almost expected but the corn syrup was a nice touch.

But as far as the quality of the coffee goes, I would give it two thumbs up. 
The ambiance is nice, there is plenty of seating and it seems that I have yet to walk into La Va without it being packed with people, which is a good and bad thing. Besides plenty of tables to sit at there are also comfy antique couches which add to the ambiance. 
The reason I have given La Va a four of of five is because that even though everything is delicious and the ambiance is great, it is really nothing new. It is what is to be expected from a ""coffee shop"" in a big city.

Quality of the food was about the same too. The menu is fairly diverse, and offers a variety of thai, malaysian, indian and chinese dishes. 

Definitely try the roti canai, probably the most ordered item in the restaurant. You get a huge blanket of roti, wrapped artfully into a sculpture. It is only a couple millimeters thick and strikes a perfect balance between crispiness and chewiness. It goes great with the accompanying curry sauce, which also contains some pieces of chicken and potato. 

I also tried out the indian mee goreng on my most recent visit. It certainly had a lot of taste and went well with the other dishes I ordered, but a warning that there is a strong seafood taste (they use dried squid sauce).

Another favorite of mine is the beef rendang. The beef is super tender and the curry sauce it is cooked in is delicious - tastes of coconut milk and lemongrass, with hints of cinnamon. Order a bowl or two of rice to go with this!

Finally, I would order the spareribs malaysian style. These pork shortribs are lightly fried, but the meat is juicy and goes really well with the accompanying sweet and sour sauce!

It all changed a few weeks ago, however. Not sure if the chef is on vacation, gone for good, or they received an extra large shipment of sauce. But all the positives I mentioned above reversed.

We're all educated foodies and 2 of 3 of us like aggressively seasoned food. From our reservation through receiving our check, the service was outstanding, attentive without being overbearing, and our server displayed absolutely expert knowledge of the menu and the beverage pairings. The restaurant is modern, without being minimalist, and quite noisy.The kitchen is open and there are several seats at a bar, so the diners can watch the cooks as they create the dishes. Dinner is a pre fixe menu of four courses each with 4 or 5 choices for $55 per person with beverage pairings with each course for an additional $50. For the 3rd course, there was an option of a roasted pork dish for 2 which could be substituted for the 3rd course for a $40 supplement. Two of us had the beverage pairings (my husband was the unlucky designated driver who didn't).

We each ordered a different choice for each of the first 3 courses, and the 9 dishes were creative but wildly variable in execution with some flashes of brilliance, a couple of solid courses, and too many  misses for the price of the meal. Before the first course, we all received a gruyere gougere that was piping hot and delicious with the dill butter that accompanied the dish. We then received a small serving of the chef's signature dish, fois gras soup, which was, unfortunately, only lukewarm and garnished with a tiny dice of shallot and rye crouton. I believe that it would have been much better if had been served warmer which would have allowed the full flavor of the fois gras to shine. Served room temperature, it was somewhat bland with a very peppery finish.  For the first course, I had the eggplant terrine with geleed tomato and goat cheese, shaved cucumber, and green garbanzo beans that all of the table agreed was absolutely delightful. It was light and refreshing, perfectly seasoned and the wine paired with the dish was perfect. My daughter had the beef filet tartar with a cute presentation in a flat mason jar. It consisted of finely diced filet in a cream based sauce at the bottom of the jar covered with a Worcestershire sauce gel and accompanied by crostini. The gel was heavily salted, and my daughter ended up scraping it off, only eating the beef. Because the meat was in a cream base, it was overly rich and she ended up not eating much of it. The lambrusco that accompanied her dish was delicious. My husband had the Caesar salad with romaine which came heavily coated in Caesar dressing topped with fennel tempura. The dressing spoiled the dish; it was fishy and pure salt. My hubby thought the small pieces of fennel tempura were light and crispy, and the only part of the dish that he could eat. 

The second course was a home run all round. My agnolotti consisted with goat cheese filled pasta with an intense crawfish flavored sauce, several crawfish tails, garnished with sautéed sea beans. If I could have licked the bottom of the bowl, I would have. My daughter utterly enjoyed the bucatini with crabmeat in a moderately spicy tomato chili sauce, and my husband savored the barley risotto with small bits of charred mushroom, fava beans, and rabbit, which was surprisingly dried and hard, more like bacon. He was happy with the flavors and thought the seasoning was spot on. The entrée (3rd) course was, sadly, more miss than hit. My course, the brook trout sautéed until the skin was crisp, topped with chopped hazelnuts, and accompanied by spots of romescu sauce and haricot verts, was, by consensus, the best of the group. It was perfectly seasoned, light, and the trout was perfectly cooked. My daughter ordered the game hen which was served deep fried in a very spicy curry glaze. It wasn't too spicy, it was plainly too salty to be eaten. Even with removing the crust, the underlying meat was salty. My husband ordered the lamb, which was described by the server as being cooked well-done like a brisket, and it was well-done to the point of being overdone and inedible. It was served with a large hunk of grilled trumpet mushroom, and roasted potatoes, all mixed in an intensely salty, overly rich, inedible sauce. After 3 bites, he could not eat any more. Sadly, he was then overwhelmed by the strong aroma of the curry glaze on my daughter's game hen and had to turn his head away from her.

For dessert, my daughter ordered with coffee cake with white chocolate ice cream accompanied by a bourbon/coffee beverage, both which she enjoyed. My husband and I both had the hot fudge sundae which was two small scoops of vanilla ice cream with pieces of pizelle and strawberry rhubarb compote drizzled with hot fudge. The rhubarb was not cooked, but rather in small raw pieces, a tartness I didn't believe belonged in the dish but wasn't offended by, but my husband did not like at all and felt spoiled the dessert.

Village Whiskey is pretty tiny.  About seven round tables that could fit maybe three people (might be able to fit four, but highly unlikely) and some room at the bar.  Came for lunch at 11:30am when they opened, and by about 12:15pm, all the tables and most of the seats at the bar were taken.  

We were the second group to be seated, and although there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, our waitress seemed to be preoccupied after taking our order.  She knew we were still deciding on drinks, so why didn't she check on us again?  Hello!  She wasn't very attentive and seemed like she would rather be elsewhere.

I ordered the Village Burger (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with Boston bibb lettuce, tomato, and house-made thousand island dressing: $11) and added Jasper Hill cheddar cheese ($3.50) and fried egg ($1.50).  Perfect brunch meal right?  Eh.  Was just okay.  The burger wasn't anything spectacular, definitely not anything to rave about.  It was juicy, but lacked flavor.  Usually the bun makes the burger (for me at least), and I thought the sesame roll was okay.  Tasted like an everyday burger bun to me.  The cheddar cheese and fried egg were a nice additional to the burger.  At 8 ounces, this burger is pretty huge!  Could definitely serve as another meal or late night snack.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=QZ4Yn47TLprQlbCRWMtZdw

We also ordered the duck fat french fries with sly-fox cheddar sauce ($7) to share.  I've always always wanted to try duck fat fries.  These left me wanting more.  Really...is this what they really taste like?  I hope not.  These fries were more soggy than crispy, and left a weird after taste in my mouth.  The cheddar sauce was a welcomed additional, but not necessary.  The sauce would have been better if it was hotter.  

When our waitress finally came back with our food, we were able to order the Irish Car Bomb shake ($9).  Ours definitely didn't look like a lot of the pictures that were posted on Yelp.  For $9, this shake better be spectacular!  Again, it was just okay.  I did enjoy those chunks of brownie pieces though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=EbqJLiD6Pkw7u1KgFVmJAA

RG ordered the Whiskey King (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with maple bourbon glazed ciopollini, rogue bleu cheese, applewood bacon, and foie gras-$26).  Massive burger.  The bleu cheese was almost non-existent.  I tried a bite, and the foie gras was pretty good.  The applewood bacon was a nice touch.  But again, the burger was just okay.

Burrito:
is to die for! The burrito is packed with flavor and filling. You get a piece of fish every bite you get. The spice level is just right and it leaves so full but still wanting for more.

Tacos: 
are alright. Nice flavors but nothing too special. Most of the time the avocados aren't very ripe so you don't really get any flavor from it. 

Katsu: 
is pretty good. I love the sauce they drizzle the chicken and rice with. I just wish they would put a little bit more sauce on it. I sorta wish there was more going on because it is essentially breaded chicken with rice and a salad.

I've been to dinner, lunch, and happy hour here all multiple times so I know my way around this place. Before I discuss the many great things about this establishment I'll mention two issues that are less than good.

First this place has an active bar with multiple TVs.  This is great for Happy Hour but not so great if you are seated near it with the intention of having a peaceful meal.  So Rule #1 is to ask to be seated away from the bar.  I've never found this to be a problem as the staff is very accommodating.

Second, in my opinion, the adult libations are generally a dollar or two too high for a mid-level Italian place.  It's very easy to order drinks here that go over $10.  So consider yourself forewarned.

So let's talk about all the positive attributes-

The location is fabulous.  It's within walking distance of Olde City, the Walnut Street Theater, the Historic District, etc., etc.  

The have a few outside tables and Chestnut Street is great for people watching.

These folks have one of the best free parking arrangements in all of Philadelphia.  That's right, I said free and the parking lot is in the same building.  If you are driving in it doesn't get any better than this. Note that free parking is available after 3 PM.  

They use OpenTable so making your reservation is super convenient.  By the way, these folks do a great job during Restaurant Weeks. Make yourself a note to book early for those coveted RW seatings.

Regarding the food; expect classic Italian in large portions.  It doesn't matter if you are a carnivore, like your protein from the sea, or are of the vegetarian persuasion.  Everybody will be happy here.  Expect appetizers to be about $10 and entrées to range from the high teens to mid-twenties. 

The Broccoli Rabe appetizer ($10) is to die for.  It comes with sweet Italian sausage and grilled polenta.  The lovely wife has tried the Chicken Alla Roma ($21) and pronounced it excellent.  It comes with mushrooms and asparagus in a lemon-caper sauce.

Start with seafood wonton soup, a miso-like broth brimming with ginger-filled dumplings, or curried chicken ravioli with grilled eggplant. What seem to be odd combinations prove to be inventive, and delicious, creations - smoked duck with endive, spicy shrimp with sweet pear curry, sesame seed-encrusted halibut filet with crunchy French beans and tomatoes in a lemongrass sauce. Noodle dishes and stir-fries are impressive. One area where they really shine is one usually ignored by Asian eateries - dessert. Ginger creme with strawberries, hazelnut meringue with milk chocolate and champagne-poached kumquats, and fresh mango and blueberry cake are options that warrant serious consideration.

I ate here a couple months ago and it was average (maybe three stars) but after this last experience they have been demoted to a one star in my eyes. We ordered the chicken saltimbocca ($23) and the chicken picante ($15) each with a side of linguine w/ the garlic butter sauce and each came with a side of escarole soup and side salad. We ordered this for pickup so they then told us that we had to bring them containers to put the soup in because they didn't have any. And I dint think this was just because they ran out bc my gf remembered this happening in the past. 

So we picked it up after we took out money at the Wawa because they don't take cards. Um its 2011, everyone uses cards. Get with the times son. We finally got the food back to my place and when we opened it up we found out that they gave us marinara sauce instead of the garlic butter and I'd usually let it slide but I was really in the mood for it and I'm tired of not getting what i ordered. So I called them up and the lady that answered the phone gave me to the guy that took the order and I explained that we didn't get the right sauces and he said in a very rude tone ""well I didn't hear your wife or your girlfriend or whoever that was say that you wanted that sauce. Its an extra 2 dollars for that sauce. I can make it for you and you can come back up and it will be 4 bucks"". I was so caught off guard and didn't know what to say I just said ""no I wont be doing that"" and hung up. After I hung up all the great comebacks that I missed out on.

Prompt seating = bonus.  We sat around the kitchen bar counter and so got to enjoy watching them make pizza all night long.  Ok on to the food.  I read from other reviews that the ritolo was a must try and indeed it is a must try.  They are relatively small so if you get two (which we did) its not a big deal.  We got the crudo pizza and the margerita pizza.  The pizza dough on both was perfect, a bit crispy but still chewy and full of flavor.  We got the crudo pizza and the margerita pizza.  The crudo pizza was our favorite out of the two.  Its a bit bigger than a personal pizza, so perfect for two people to share.  Then came the dessert, I was not expecting much from the dessert as this is a pizza place, but we ordered the fried dough and the cappacino soft serve ice cream.  The ice cream blew us away.  Perhaps the best ice cream we have ever had.  One of the people in our group was lactose intolerant and even she said screw it and had some of the ice cream, it was that good.  

On a side note, toward the end of our dinner vetri came in and was talking to the various chefs and employees.  Kind of cool to see him in the restaurant.

Overall an awesome experience that lived up to our expectations and then some.  Will definitely be making this a regular place.",2013-10-05 12:28:59,"{'food': ['crudo pizza', 'margerita pizza'], 'drink': ['cappacino soft serve ice cream']}"

But we did have a good time there -even though I believe that it's partly because of the influence from one of my friend's wife; she spoke Chinese fluently.. so it made things easier haha.

I love squid, and it's always a rare treat when you find a place that serves it grilled instead of deep fried.  I love the concept, but for me the taste of the squid was overpowered by the taste of char from the grill.  When they say grilled, they mean GRILLED.  I used some extra lemon wedges to brighten it up a bit, which definitely helps, but I don't think I'll order that dish again. 

My boyfriend on the other hand, ordered the seafood combination - a tomato/garlic based broth with a ton of seafood.  I had total food envy.   The seafood combination pretty much had it all - shrimp, clams, mussels, tilapia, scallops.. super delicious. Next time, I'm ordering that.

Our appetizer was the shrimp scampi, and it was good, but they lose points for serving shrimp that hadn't been properly cleaned.  If you see that long, thin black ""blood vein"" in your shrimp, diner be ware.  That's not a vein, and it's not blood.  It's the digestive tract, and therefore I bet you can guess what that actually is.  (Ew)  

In the past I've had the shrimp pil pil, grilled octopus and hummus and those were pretty tasty.  Some of the smaller octopus pieces were overcooked, but overall it had good flavor.

I ordered the hangar steak starter as I wasn't ravenously hungry, and my partner ordered the margherita pizza. The service was by the way, very attentive and food arrived very fast.
My steak was raw, tough and tasteless. Inedible. I don't even think it was hangar steak, it looked more like a sirloin tip. Took me 4 minutes to chew one small piece. The salad it came with was tasty so I just ate that and told my waitress that the steak was lousy. She offered to bring me something else, but I refused.
The pizza was tasty and enjoyable, but hardly memorable. 

To In Riva's credit, they did not charge us for the steak dish.

It has now been cemented as my go-to place for an occasion dinner. We arrived early, and sat at the bar just in time for the happy hour special. The bartender was a bit slow to take our order, but it was unexpectedly crowded for a Tuesday night, so that was excusable. We brought our own bottle of wine (which you can do, albeit at the expense of a $25 corking fee, though they do not advertise this), which we left with the hostess when we came in. When it came time for our reservation, our bottle of wine was already waiting at our table, on a small silver tray. I was quite impressed.

The Prime Rib exudes elegance in a way few places do nowadays. From the leopard print carpet to the black wood paneling to the lucite-lidded grand piano to the sharply suited waiters, you feel like you stepped back in time to an elegant restaurant in Midtown Manhattan in all the best ways. Our waiter, as expected, was impeccable. Even though he was also waiting on a large group nearby, our wine glasses were always full and our food was brought out with perfect timing.

As an appetizer, my boyfriend and I ordered the tuna tartare to split. When it came out, it was already split onto individual plates, which was a nice touch. The tuna was delicious, and there was certainly $19 worth of it between our two plates. For entrees, I ordered the veal porterhouse, and my boyfriend ordered the full cut of the prime rib. I am a tremendous fan of veal, though I had never had it as a porterhouse steak before, and I was not disappointed. Deliciously seasoned, generously cut, and perfectly tender, I would order it again in a heartbeat. The full cut of the prime rib was, to quote my boyfriend, ""as big as [his] head"". I didn't even know one could have a cut of meat so gigantic. He said it was delicious, and after trying a bit, I agreed with him. He didn't finish it, and I imagine most people wouldn't be able to. We got potatoes au gratin on the side, and they were good, but they're just potatoes au gratin, nothing to write home about. For dessert, I got a slice of key lime pie, which was solidly good, as expected.

I elected to go with one of the day's specials...walnut-encrusted chicken with haricot verts and mashed root vegetables. What does that mean exactly? Parsnips instead of potatoes? Parsnips AND potatoes? I am pretty sure there was no yucca involved. LOL I digress. The mashed root veggies was the star of the plate though. The string beans tasted of charred water. The walnut-encrusted chicken was a tasty idea, but the crusting was quite overcooked, again lending a burnt flavor. The chicken came covered in a maple gravy...mild taste of maple, and it was a cream gravy. I was expecting a brown gravy with the maple flavor.

On to the ice cream!!! My lady friend and I split a belgian waffle, topped with ice cream. As the man, the choice was left to me to pick the ice cream flavor. I went with cinnamon bun, and it was GREAT. The waffle was hot and freshly cooked perfectly, slightly underdone and soft which favored the ice cream on top. The creamy cinnamon flavor was very decadent, especially because it included multiple globules of cinnamon-sugarized butter.  Wowzers.

Like others before me have stated, the wait can be long, but I usually get around that by opting for a later lunch on days that I choose to eat from the Falafel truck. 1:00 is usually perfect. 

Some people are offended by Konstadinos' rules, but really, I appreciate them. The fact that there isn't a menu is exciting! I like not knowing exactly what I'm going to get... but maybe I'm more adventurous than some people. Really, though, it's not even like he switches things up that much... He just tweaks the details a bit. The chicken is always on the platter, there is always falafel, and there is always hummus. The dessert salad and the chickpea salad/rice/whatever is all that really changes.

And I also appreciate that he doesn't let you hold a spot for someone or order more than one platter. He realizes that most of his clientele are working folks that are on tight schedules. 

If you're lucky, you might catch him on a good day and he'll throw in a free drink. It's only happened to me once or twice, but still, a nice little perk. And if it happens to be cold out/rainy out, he sometimes offers soup while you wait!

So Parada Maimon is a good compromise. Most of the times I've been here I've gotten the pernil with rice and black beans. I've tried the half chicken, the gizzards, and the mofongo. The chicken was good enough that I brought some home to my family. It was a hit. The price can't really be beaten. For those wondering, you can sub out rice and beans for some fries... or maybe some other side they're offering. 

What issues did I have? You can either order at the counter or you can have a seat. The counter (cafeteria style) food is ready-made while most other things are made to order. My first impression was underwhelming... as the pernil I had was dry. I didn't know to ask for gravy since I ordered from the menu. That wasn't enough to keep me away because I came back and had the mofongo and I didn't like it much. I mentioned in a review for another place that I don't fault the establishment. I just didn't know what I was getting into because it more or less tastes the same everywhere I've tried it. There was a little confusion in the portions... they should just say large and small, but instead they say lunch and dinner if I remember correctly.

So for the best dine-in experience... order at the counter, if you're not fluent in Spanish then English is fine...mostly (I got a verbal judo flip with my basic Spanish), state what sauces/gravy you want on your food and then have a seat. Also, get one of their fresh juices (Chinola for me). If you really want to EAT get the dinner (large) portion, but if you're there for the deal get the lunch (small). 

So with a large plate of pernil with a good amount of gravy, some hot sauce and oil for the rice, and some thousand island or whatever for the little salad... I'm NICE! I think they have tres leches too, but I've been too full to try it.

PRO-TIP: And ask for maduros... I don't think they're included, but I don't think they're extra. It's just like 3 or 4 and anyway.

FUN FACT: The area is desolate so there's really no best way in or out on foot. You're catching alleys, bums, and long empty stretches on all sides. Seriously, don't let that stop you from checking this place out.",2017-09-09 03:45:05,

Aldine had been on my to-try nearly since it opened.  They offer three courses, plus dessert, and drinks via their a la carte menu.  As I've always preferred a variety of food versus a huge portion of one dish when dining out, their type of menu plays to my preferences.  

We each began with a cocktail and first.  I cannot recall the name of my cocktail, but you'll know it as the one with tequila, watermelon, and a chilli pepper spice.  The spice was not overpowering, but did help ensure I didn't down the drink in one go!  As for our firsts, we shared the beets and corn + truffle custard.  The beet salad came with a cashew butter that helped balance the ingredients.  The custard appeared simple and straight forward, but after tasting I realized it had 'a lot going on' with bits of mushroom and tomato.

Instead of each ordering a second, we split the heirloom tomato.  Like the previous salad, it was well assembled and presented.  I could share more notes, but it went down so quickly!

We ended the savory dishes by sharing the culotte steak and pork coppa.  I was surprised just how well the blueberry paired with the pork and black garlic chips that came with the steak ensure each bite was excellent.  No worries about temperature as they were both cooked perfectly.

We ended the night with dessert, including a well place candle arranged by Nataly N.  Their olive oil cake was rather simple but nonetheless delicious.  The panna cotta was smooth and very easy to enjoy.

To round out my review, I can touch on service and atmosphere.  It was easy to say service was amazing.  Prompt coverage without interrupting our alone time.

Portions are enough to fill me up on my lunch break and I always leave satisfied with a tasty meal and a full stomach.

Around noon is when they are busiest which when you'll likely have to wait quite a bit longer than usual, but to be honest their food is worth it. My typical order is the chicken katsu with an egg on top. It comes with a nicely crunched chicken fillet on a bed of rice with some avocado and salads on the side along with the option to make it spicy or not (I personally put spicy mayo). Everything is freshly made each day and you can definitely taste it when you dig in.

The feel of this trendy spot is very posh, but works well and has a great energy to it. The prices are reasonable, and the beer selection although not extensive, is very well selected. (A trend of Kimpton hotel restaurants). 

The problem for me was the service. Although upon being flagged, the staff was friendly and proficient, there was very little initiative. There needs to be a happy medium of attentiveness, but not too the point where annoyance or over-bearing takes effect.

The truffle popcorn was good, but the butter wasn't very well distributed. Each small handful had a different taste. The pork confit quesadillas were very impressive, and were accompanied with a smokey chipotle dipper that really maximized the taste of the confit.",2011-01-09 13:49:27,"{'food': ['truffle popcorn', 'pork confit quesadillas'], 'drink': []}"

I was such a loyal visitor, I refused to go to this ""Khyber Pass Pub"" for a long time out of loyalty to the spirit of the original Khyber. How dare they take it away from me! Well, I confess: I was goddamn stupid. STUPID, I say.

After hearing through word-of-mouth (you know, how people found out about things pre-Yelp), that the KPP had a bangin' menu (their words), we decided to drop in on a Friday. It was a First Friday in old city, so I prepared for a madhouse.

Not so much. It was busy, but we were seated within 10 minutes. The tables are a weeee bit too close together though. Another 6 inches in each direction would be great, but as long as your sister's miscarriage isn't a topic of conversation, everything should be gravy. I mean bacon fat. I mean bacon fat popcorn. What? I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention. It says ""bacon fat popcorn"" on the menu. (You should try it. It's well worth the vein clog.)

The menu: Do you love BBQ with a southern/Louisiana flavor? This is the place. Pulled pork? Yes, gimme more. They have a BBQ sampler for those who can't choose. The vegan po' boy is great too, and I'm not even vegan. Their mashed potatoes are basically ""we cooked this potato in enchanted salt water and literally smashed it onto your plate."" And surprise! That's vegan too. The mac & cheese is not, of course. I burned my mouth on it from eating it too fast, and you know what? Worth it.

Huge draft list, and reasonably priced.

If you have a mixed group of vegans, veggies, omnivores, carnivores, and beer fanatics, this is the Place To Take Them All. Go during the week to avoid the old city weekend crowds.

The girls and I walked right in on a Friday night with a few bottles of wine in hand and had a wonderful experience at Zorbas. We shared an array of dishes such as the cold platter stocked with great mix of yummy greek dips ( hummus, feta , tzatzikii etc). It was a hit for sure- just note that it comes with one pita- the dips are very generous and the 5 of us had no problem sharing- we had to request more pita though (which by the way, the pita is perfect). The mussels in a sweet red red wine sauce sans shells were so tasty. The hot feta dip and spring salad were also just as good. We topped the meal off splitting a delicious slice of cake in honor of my friend's birthday. The service was very accomodating and the atmosphere inside is super cozy- nothing fancy,  has an old school Greek feel. All of this for a mere $15/person.  You can't beat it !

Let me start with my favorite part - the menu is pasted into children's books which is so cool! 
The atmosphere is hipsterish - dim lighting, great music, and laid back vibe. I went on a Sunday for brunch and it was not too crowded, easy to walk in and get seated without a wait. 

SO MUCH BETTER THAN GREEN EGGS in my opinion. 

After much deliberation between various items, I ordered the chicken and waffles and in the words of DJ Tanner, OH MY LANTA. The seasoning on the chicken was beyond delicious (not dry at all, which is a complaint I often have about chicken) and the waffles were crisp and perfectly done. The syrup was not too rich and sweet and you could tell it was authentic, not the sugary thick store bought stuff. 

In addition, I have to say, I found the HOLY GRAIL of biscuits. These are not your small round KFC biscuits. They are HUGE, soft, mushy, delicious, amazing. I have been craving them every day since. They have cheddar bits baked inside and when you pull these freshly baked delights apart and take a bite, I guarantee a religious experience.

Our waiter was perfectly attentive, in that he always magically appeared when you needed a wine refill but in a very noninvasive way. The front of the house was outstanding. When we spotted another table getting a dish that were not on the menu and asked about it, she sent out a complementary dish for our table which was very unexpected and appreciated. 

Now to the food. We started with the tomato burrata salad and the chilled sweet corn crab soup. Both were delicious, the burrata was some of the best tasting cheese I've ever had. For seconds, we had the poached egg and the wahoo. Both were standouts. The lamb ribs (not on the menu) came in between our second and third course and were sumac incrusted caramelized lamb ribs. Their texture was a cross between candied but savory braised ribs. They were falling off the bone - and were the most special dish of the night. Finally, we had the pork tenderloin and flank steak which were both stellar. The portions were perfect, and we left very full without dessert. 

This restaurant has outstanding value. We have spent that much on many dinners that pale in comparison to this meal, especially with drinks, so the BYOB aspect makes it a special dinner place that you can go to more than once in a while. The ambiance is also fantastic, although it does get a little bit noisy so if you have hearing problems going earlier in the evening would be ideal. Also, note that the restaurant is very friendly to folks who are gluten-free as every dish with the exception of one on the menu was gluten-free last night.

I am writing this review even before I head to the restaurant for dinner tonight and believe me when I say this, that I would never end up eating here if the majority of the birthday girl's party did not insist on eating at Han Dynasty just because she likes the food. 


It takes 2 phone calls and talking to 3 people to get a reservation at this restaurant, that itself is a turn off. The first lady I speak to is flat out rude when I call asking to make a dinner reservation for tonight ""We're all booked for tonight and not giving out any reservations"" she says before hanging up on me. I call back and a second lady answers and I say I need a reservation for 15 people at 9:30 and she asks for how long? WTF??? ""For however long it takes 15 adults to get done with dinner that's how long"" She responds saying they close at 10PM and the lady has no clue what day it is and they are open later on Friday's and finally agrees to give me a reservation. 


It is absolutely appalling when people working in the hospitality industry are rude. If you can't be courteous to your guests consider a different profession. I understand you are in the university city area and have to, more often that you like, deal with students but that by no means is an excuse for ill-treating your guests.

I took my boyfriend a few months ago and when we went, the crowd was generally in their late 20's - late 30's with a Hipsterish vibe. We were seated in front of the door at a small table which... admittedly did pose a few minor inconveniences. My boyfriend ordered a Whiskey Sampler, we split an appetizer, and we each got a sandwich... and we tried to play tetris to make it all fit and ended up using the table next to us until we were done out appetizer. As it was winter, every time the door opened we got extremely cold, and since we had winter coats that we kept on the bench behind me, when the next couple was seated at the table next to us we were so close that I had to scramble to try and compact our coats as much as possible and sit on them just so other people could sit. (Not to sound like a slob or someone that needs so much space, its just a super small area that would better suit one person rather than two and might use one less table to create just a little more breathing room)
But the food was incredible. We got the cheese fries with oxtail to split, and I got the fried chicken sandwich. Mouth-watering good.

We couldn't decide on what we wanted to eat because my girlfriend was in the mood for ice cream while I was craving a cheeseburger. Lucky for us, our friend knew about this place that could satisfy us both simultaneously.

Rating Breakdown:

2/2 Stars for Taste - I got the Cowboy Burger served rare. The patty was meaty, thick, and grilled perfectly with just the right amount of pink inside. The BBQ meat juice that had dripped onto my plate was promptly sopped up with the amazing crispy shoestring fries that came with the burger. Desserts were good, the pistachio and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream were delicious. I wasn't terribly impressed with the Apple Brown Betty because it was a bit more apple than I would like. But if you are a fan of such things, it was warm, sweet, and moist -- very satisfying in my belly on a rainy day.

1/1Stars for Value - Most burgers and entrees were around $10 and came with a side of fries. However, large plates can also cost upward of $15, trespassing into a no-no zone for me personally. Desserts were ~$4 each but come in decent-sized portions that make them worth trying. You won't leave this place hungry, for sure. Generous portions ensure you leave here stuffed.

1/1 Stars for Customer Service - The wait staff here was definitely very hipster,  wearing colored jeans or cut-off jean shorts, which I found endearing. Our waitress was very friendly. We had been in the car for over 5 hours so we were guzzling water with no abandon. She made sure our glasses were always full, even if it meant coming back every 5 minutes or so. Also, one of my pet peeves is waiting forever for the check + receipt. The waitress sensed we were in a hurry and came back promptly after I gave her my card.

No bonus star because even though the food was good, it wasn't anything terribly special for the price. There are definitely other places I'd be more willing to drop $10 at in Philly. However, if you're in the area and in the mood for both burgers and ice cream, this is good place to stop by!",2013-06-24 18:34:18,"{'food': ['Cowboy Burger', 'Apple Brown Betty'], 'drink': ['ice cream']}"

I'd eaten at the Falafel truck before so as soon as the incredible aromas of grilled marinated chicken hit my nose I knew what I was going to be chowing down on that day.

The food at this truck is amazing. While the meal varies quite a bit from day today, there are a few things you can generally count on: a portion of delicious hummus, some really good falafel, a pita or roll, a generous helping of some of the best grilled, marinated chicken that I've ever tasted, and two other items. One of the two is usually some sort of risotto or pasta in sauce (which is always good). The other is often a sauce or fruit item. 

Recently, the chef has also been handing out cups of soup to people as they wait in line (different soups every day) and a bottle of Perrier with the meal. He does not list a price but generally charges $10, which is well worth it for an enormous and tasty meal that should last all day.


It's also worth noting that the comments about the guy who runs this truck are not exaggerated. He is a real character and likes to go on and on about how high quality his food is, how difficult it is to get quality ingredients, etc. He wants to know if you like quality food and if you are willing to pay for quality. Quality quality quality. Quality. At first I found this a little off-putting but now I find it an endearing feature of the experience. He clearly cares a lot about what he does and as long as you don't take the conversation too seriously it'll be fine. 


My one MAJOR caveat for this place is do NOT try to eat here if you are very particular about your food. He gives you what he gives you and isn't going to be making anything specific to your tastes. It's also very hard to predict how spicy his food will be -- usually it's relatively mild but occasionally it can get quite hot. I wouldn't count on being able to get a description before getting served, so only venture here if you are fairly flexible about the flavor profile of what you are getting. I also might suggest shying away if you have food allergies.

I expected the service and dining to be of the same quality as my many other experiences. However I have to admit I highly value the opinions of fellow yelpers and was a little worried that this location would not measure up to par because of some of the negative reviews and comments. Not sure what happened with their dining experiences but i found it to be a very nice experience.

 We parked in the 1500 Locust parking lot, about 4 blocks away, and if you go to central parking website you can often get web discounts (in this case I paid 3 hours for $10 instead of $23 which is what we owed) the valet at ruth chris is $18, which was a little steep for me and so I looked for a bargain. Parking is always a b***** downtown so always good to know about deals in the area.

The location is perfect, close to Reading Terminal Market, restaurants, center city, and provides easy access to the other Philly sites! I found the cost per night for a weekend stay to be more affordable than many other hotels in the city and also in the surrounding areas outside the city. 

Our room was very spacious, clean, and well equipped. I was impressed with the overall size of the bathroom and the comfortableness of the bed! I was very pleased with how quiet the hotel floor was at night, even though the hotel was full that weekend, which contributed to the relaxing atmosphere and sleep in the room. We ordered coffee service the night before for the following morning, as we often do at many places we stay. The presentation of the coffee tray was reflective of the high quality of hotel Loews exhibits. In addition to the coffee setting, glasses of ice water were part of the service and the waitperson, who delivered the coffee, was very friendly, professional and helped to start our morning off on a positive note!

The only reason I did not give the last star in the rating was due to the cost of parking. Parking at the hotel is valet only and they charge $49+ per night for guests staying at the hotel, which I find outrageous. Instead of paying this price, we used Parking Panda to locate a parking garage, one block away for only $24 per 24 hours! I don't mind walking a block or two to park if it's only going to cost half the price of the hotel.

I'm not the type of person who regularly writes yelp reviews - I like most places where I eat and don't feel the need to write about it. That being said, because our experience at R2L was so anomalous, I felt I had to warn people about the service. 

While the food was good, and the view was wonderful, we had an unfortunate experience. At the beginning of our meal, the waitress was friendly and built a rapport with us. However, there was an unfortunate incident where someone (not our server) on the waitstaff knocked a glass of water on one of us and spilled our bottle of wine on the floor. No wine got on either of us, and we were very understanding - mistakes happen. We get it. Here's where problems arose. 

What great service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled and comp something trivial, like a desert or app. 

What reasonable service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled. 

What actually, unfortunately, happened: The waitstaff gave us a bunch of napkins and apologized a couple of times. One of about three people hurriedly cleaning us up promised us 2 extra glasses to make up for the wine that had soaked into the carpet. Finally, the gentleman who made the mistake was very apologetic. Up until this point - totally fine. 

Then, after a few minutes of everyone, including our formerly-friendly server, avoiding us like they heard there was a sudden outbreak of the Zika virus at our table, our server finally resurfaced to refill water. When one of us asked whether that wine was coming out (after all, someone we hadn't met before promised it then disappeared), rather than reassuring us, this was the response, verbatim: ""You didn't finish the bottle yet. We were going to bring it out when you finished the bottle."" Excuse me? 

After the flippant response, our waitstaff's avoidant behavior continued. We finished our bottle of wine with dinner, then ordered a dessert (hey, maybe this would give them a chance to be reminded by the wine stain in the carpet that they promised to compensate us for our overpriced loss with a glass?).  Frustrated, we asked for the check. After our waitress ran our card, FINALLY, upon returning our check, she poured our two drinks, without speaking a word to us, as we were about to leave.

The steak was melt-in-your mouth good. I had the filet au poivre cooked medium rare, my husband the cowboy ribeye medium well. We were both pleased. He ordered a side of the twice baked potato and I the sweet potato casserole, most of which wound up coming home with me.

Went to Urban Village per request from a member of my group of friends to check it out after a month of their opening. It is pretty clear that they are still getting over a learning curve. We were seated outside and our waiter, while very polite, was overall not attentive and not knowledgeable of the menu. He was helpful with the beer selection though, so a plus there. In addition the lighting outside on the porch was just pitiful going into the sunset. You can't see anyone. Aim for a spot inside the restaurant if you are arriving at night. Great bathrooms though, very clean.

We all ordered some variant of the pizza just to try them all out. Out of 7 pies that we ordered, I really only liked 1, maybe two of them and even so, they were mostly dough and barely any cheese or toppings on them. For the price tag of around $12-14 a pie, that was really disappointing. Maybe the other food is better, but I cannot comment on that and only through my experience.

The beer itself was good, but I've had better from other brewpubs in the city at cheaper prices as well. Most of the beers are pretty entry-level if you are a craft beer lover, so nothing exciting.

Overall it was nice to try out the place, I don't go to NoLibs often so it is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, but I don't think I will be returning for the food, maybe for 1-2 beers if I am getting ready to go out somewhere.

Cambodian food is an extremely tasty cuisine that has influences from neighboring countries like Thailand and Vietnam but has its own distinctive style.  And Khmer Kitchen is the best and most authentic Cambodian restaurant in Philadelphia. This is not the easiest restaurant to get to as it is nestled deep in South Philadelphia but it is totally worth seeking out.

My favorite dish here is the Prah-hok kahteeh pork dish prepared spicy.  When you add rice to this and the accompanying vegetables, you have quite a treat (think chile con carne but better).  The way the plate is set up here looks so pretty that you almost hate to eat it.  All the famous Cambodian sour soups like the iconic Salaw machu kre'ung are also hearty and individually prepared.  The papaya salad is awesome and just looks and tastes totally healthy.  And I love that they are able to obtain and use some real Cambodian vegetables like Cambodian eggplant or cabbage. The food is prepared to order so it's not coming out fast from the kitchen.  Mom and Grandmom and Auntie are all in the back putting each dish together so be prepared to wait.  Just bring along some good wine or beer with you and anticipate what is to come.

LOCATION: this place shares a parking lot with Longhorn Steakhouse so there are plenty of spaces. Its also near a best buy, etc so should you have to wait you can shop around. Although we didnt wait at all

LAYOUT: Being from baltimore, we wanted to watch the 1pm game a/g Pittsburgh. The Eagles game was at 4pm. There were PLENTY tvs all around to watch ANY football game you wanted. There are plenty of seats all of which you can view the TVs if you wanted with a bar area in the middle of the floor as well.

ATMOSPHERE: family friendly and clean! I especially liked the fact that during commericals for the main game, they played music and as soon as the game came back on the music stopped. This is atypical of some places, as they play music the whole time and you only can read the close captioning while watching the game.

DRINKS: Drink menus are very important to me. I like variety and boy did this place had it. They had various drink concoctions they put together that seemed very interesting! I had two of their different drinks and was not disappointed by either of them.

DESSERTS: Delish!!! My friend got the mile-high cake and wow!!! This stands at least 6 inches high with about 6 layers. For only $8, this fed the whole table!

APPETIZERS: DO NOT leave there without trying the crab bread, and that says alot for someone coming from Baltimore. There's also this special dipping sauce that comes with it? Exquisite!! I couldnt get enough. The spinach/artichoke appetizer was definitely a treat as well.

ENTREES: the fajitas are to die for, i had the cajun shrimp pasta which was good. The salmon was bland, but the bbq chicken sandwiches were great! A friend had grilled chicken greek salad and the chicken was plentiful.  Also for you health food nuts, all the nutritional facts are posted for EVERYTHING, even the drinks.

xochitl, the RESTAURANT you go to for an impressively cooked meal that is worth the somewhat overpriced expense for mexican food ... NOT SO MUCH.  

they do serve some of the finest margaritas in the city. they are, as rumored, strong and should be consumed with caution. and the guac, though very high at $9, is incredible. each table has a guac card that you can use to customize the ingredients you'd like to add to your guac, including jalapenos, garlic, tomatoes, peppers, oaxaca, and so many other things. i only say that it's steep at $9 because you don't get much in quantity, but it's fair considering the cost of avocados. 

the food was quite the disappointment.  years ago (before the menu revamp), the food was incredible. i still remember one of the duck entrees i had there as being the best duck i have ever eaten. HOWEVER, the same cannot be said now.  

we had 2 people in our group order the $26 braised short rib. and they did not even finish it. the meat was dry and a bit bland -  totally tragic. 

the rest of our table had tacos - the carne asada, the carnitas and the fish. these were solid. honestly, there wasn't anything to complain about, but they weren't particularly memorable either. 

the tacos ranged from $13-16 and included 3 tacos. of the ones we tried, i'd say the fish tacos were my favorite. 

this is the upside though. considering the dearth of options fish taco lovers have in this city, if you're having a serious fish taco craving, xochitl is a reliable bet. the fish is not breaded/fried and it tastes very fresh, citrusy and the slaw gives it great crunch.",2012-08-15 21:39:01,

However, the food was GREAT and once we switched to beer, we were very impressed with their selection of awesome local brews. The bartenders were friendly and accommodating and there was a relaxed, congenial vibe to the place.

Needless to say, I didn't go in that day)  Finally, the stars aligned and I was able to eat here.  And I'm happy I did.

I went in with two friends after getting our nails done and sat at a table.  We ordered drinks, truffled cauliflower, and an order of tater tots.  They put the tater tots closest to me and I can't control myself, so no one else at the table got tater tots.  They were really good.  I ordered the burger without the thousand island dressing and with cheddar and caramelized onions.  That was a GOOOOOOOOOOOD burger.  Cooked perfectly, juicy, and the roll was soft and pillowy.  It didn't last long on my plate.  We got an order of duck fat french fries for the table and while they were good, I think I liked the tater tots better and would probably order them as our side next time. 

My only issue with Village Whiskey is the space.  It's so small.  They crammed the three of us into a space that really was built for two people.

I've never waited in line less than 45 minutes, so I can only make the trip on days that I know I have plenty of free time for lunch. It's quite an experience and the food is amazing. I'll just reiterate some of what others have already said... the cook is a real character so the experience can be intimidating if you don't know what to do. 

The truck is located on the Northeast corner of 20th and Market, next to an empty lot. You'll recognize the truck because it will have a long line, smoke pouring out of the top, and decorations on the front of the truck including plants and garlic. The truck wasn't there the first few times I tried to go, so I'm not sure if he goes on vacation at some point. Also keep in mind that even if the line doesn't look that long, it takes a lot of time; maybe 5 minutes per person that's in front of you. 

While you wait in line, he will offer you a cup of delicious soup that you should take and enjoy. I don't know exactly what it is, but it tastes like pumpkin or some other type of squash. Once you get to the front of the line, you don't need to order. You just take what he gives you and pay $10. You usually get hummus, falafel, chicken, two side items like rice or grains or vegetables, fruit, a piece of bread or pita, and a drink of the cook's choosing. It's an unbelievable amount of food for $10, and it's all amazing! I wish I knew what the chicken is marinated in, because it's truly the best chicken I've ever had. The hummus is especially good too. It's really creamy. I normally eat half of it at lunch and put the rest in the fridge... and then go back to it around 4 PM because I can't resist it. And you'll smell like garlic for the rest of the day, so it's a constant reminder that delicious leftovers are waiting for you. 

The cook is actually friendly, as long as you don't question the food. He'll usually make some light conversation and talk a lot about the quality of the food.

First things first: the gelato is truly incredible. They have a huge selection of rotating flavors, and the flavors tend to match with what's seasonal, so you will have stuff like Pumpkin and Chestnut in the winter and fruity stuff and berries in the summer. However, they do have a fairly stable core of flavors like Nocciola Piemontese (Hazelnut), Fior Di Latte (Milk), and Cioccolato Scuro (Dark Chocolate) that are available most days. They will let you sample as many flavors as you would like before you place your order, so take advantage of that if you don't know what you want (or, if you already know what you want, if you just want some free samples). Since I love pretty much anything that has peanut butter in it, one of my favorite flavors was the Peanut Butter gelato, which was peanut gelato with a swirl of peanut butter mixed in - SO GOOD. Others that I really liked include Bacio (chocolate and hazelnut gelato with caramelized hazelnuts; it tastes like Nutella with crunchy hazelnuts tossed in for good measure), Chocolate Scuro (seriously dark and rich, this is the gelato of any chocolate lover's dreams), and Turkish Coffee (a really perky coffee flavor with a hint of cardamom giving it a nice kick), but really, I don't think I ran into a flavor that I didn't like. They also have some rather interesting flavors using alcohol and rums - Cucumber with Grey Goose, Dark and Stormy, etc. 

Okay, so I really love the gelato here, but honestly, the prices are pretty steep. It costs close to $6 for a medium cup, and even though the medium lets you get your choice of up to 3 different flavors, that's still a really expensive cup of gelato. Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for, as the quality ingredients used in the top-notch gelato here make it worthwhile to come here for an occasional splurge.",2011-02-15 05:03:51,"{'food': ['gelato'], 'drink': []}"

This location is perfect if you just want to grab a cup of great coffee to go, or if you prefer to enjoy it inside - there is ample seating space to sip at your leisure.

It is located within Rittenhouse area, so the parking will be tough. I typically park a few blocks south and work my way up. Walking in, the counter to order is right in front, and then the seating area is towards the left. Inside, it's upscale but casual, lots of tables and even small booths to get a group together for coffee and work. Many people seem to find this location ideal to open up their laptop and enjoy a good coffee. 

The coffee is what sells this place - great roasts, with bold, rich flavors. As you walk in you can smell the amazing scents - and it tastes just as great as it smells!

The workers are pretty friendly and the menu is lean so it doesn't get too confusing when putting in your order. The feeling I got was that if I became a regular, the baristas would definitely start knowing my name and my order. It has that charm, which is pretty endearing.

First impression was of an old establishment somewhat in need of refurbishment, but with inviting scents of curry and coriander drawing us in.  I checked the buffet as we walked past to our table and saw an extensive collection of yellow, red, brown and rusty sauces, all looking fresh and inviting on a cold Sunday night.

We ordered Tikka Masala (with Chicken), which came out in a fine pink sauce of tomato and ginger, and was quite good. The Baigan Bharta was tasty, but was chopped fine rather than with the chunky eggplant I expected.  They cheated a bit on the Garlic Naan by bringing us regular Naan painted with garlic butter.  It didn't work, as it was not integrated into the bread, but sat on the surface, and lacked the baked garlic pieces I love in true Garlic Naan.  A disappointing way to pay an extra buck. The Mango Lassi was pretty good,  but a little thin from using milk rather than yogurt.  A nice plate of rice came with the meal.

We were also recommended the Double Cooked Pork Belly, which is something I don't usually like because it's kind of fatty, but it turned out to be great as well.  They also have a cool little happy hour with some cheaper drinks so it's cool to get there a little before dinner, like we did and enjoy some cheaper drinks before dinner.  I wish they had some light beer available since I'm a girl and I'd like to have some lower calorie/lighter options for beer, but it's okay since they have a good wine selection too so I just chose to go with wine.  The food is relatively affordable, it's not Chinatown cheap, but it's not expensive either.  Overall, it was a very delicious meal in a fun, comfortable environment.

There are plenty of cabs outside if you do not want to take mass transit.  If you do need the train or bus, there is a subway stop one short block away and numerous SEPTA bus stops up and down Market St and the cross-streets.

The room was spacious and clean, although the bed was a little less than comfortable.  There is a Keurig machine in the cabinet with complimentary bold roast, decaf, or green tea with creamers and sugars.  There were ice and soda machines located on the floor below us and the container for the ice kept everything so cold that there were pieces remaining the next morning.

The only gripe I had (and the reason I deducted 1 star) is that the room service food was not that great.  One night I returned to the hotel late and my relative wanted to order something to eat.  We shared a ""barely ok"" pizza and slice of chocolate cake, which seemed to be at least a few days old.  However, the good news is that there are countless places to chow down for all meals up and down the nearby streets so really, room service shouldn't be necessary.

If you can, check out a sunrise from one of the higher floors.  I didn't expect to see that when I got up pretty early one morning.  You can also look out onto Market St traffic depending on which room view you get.

I would recommend this stay for any amount of time, short or longer, (I was able to get a very reasonable rate on Expedia) because this place is very welcoming and comfortable.  The convention center is right across the street so I think a lot of people were staying here for the Auto Show.

On our last day in the city, we checked out early and the concierge downstairs even held our bags in storage until we were ready to pick them up and head to the train station.  This was a very convenient service and helpful to us.

Shanghai Station's entrance is down a flight of stairs and the restaurant itself is situated under a hairdresser / subway. Nara used to be there, known for their sake bombs and drunken college nights (or so I've heard); Shanghai Station seems to want to keep up the drinking part of it, heavily advertising their drink specials and with a darkish interior decor interspersed with disco-y lights. Wasn't expecting too much of the food, especially since they seem to be, as a restaurant, more focused on their alcohol selection, but I was so pleasantly surprised with their food.

To preface my later comments about service of the restaurant and for context: we came in a huge group of 20 people. We ordered the pork soup dumplings (小籠包), the crab meat soup dumplings, Dan Dan noodles, Chinese broccoli, broccoli with beef, shrimp fried rice, scallion pancakes and crystal shrimp. 

Highlights: 
Pork soup dumplings - they were absolutely delicious! Each order comes with 6 dumplings, and it came out steaming hot. My usual pet peeve with these kinds of dumplings (and I'm pretty picky with them because I was spoiled with good food in Hong Kong) is when they have super thick dumpling skins. It was not the case with these - the wrappers were delicate and thin, holding the hot, rich soup that spurts out when you bite into them. Would highly recommend! My only complaint would be that they didn't bring out the vinegar dipping sauce with this dish, but make sure you ask for it because a soup dumpling would not be complete without a dash of vinegar and thin ginger strands.

Crab soup dumplings - basically same as above, but with a distinct crab flavor. 

Dan Dan noodles - they used a softer type of noodle to make this dish compared to the usual type, and I have mixed feelings about it. Taste was solid though, but I'd suggest going to the Sichuan restaurants if you really crave the authentic type of Dan Dan noodles.

Chinese broccoli - this type of vegetable (芥蘭) is probably one of my favorite types of vegetables, and it bears little resemblance to broccoli, so the name might be confusing. It's lightly sautéed in garlic, nothing too fancy but really good. Serving size is a little small though! 

Service - the soup dumplings came out pretty quickly, but we waited a long long time for the other dishes. We were in a huge group and they just opened, so I wouldn't hold it against them too much. Throughout the meal the servers were also pretty good at refilling water during the wait. 

All in all, a good, affordable option for some good Chinese food! Definitely get the soup dumplings, the crystal shrimp / broccoli with beef were alright but I'd recommend trying other dishes since they have a pretty expansive menu!",2016-03-31 19:42:20,"{'food': ['pork soup dumplings', 'crab meat soup dumplings', 'Dan Dan noodles', 'Chinese broccoli'], 'drink': []}"

It turns out a place that sells a lot of beef might become the new vegan hot spot of Philadelphia.

They label their menu which shows they are attuned to the concerns of vegans. So they meet the bare minimum. Good thing they surpass it.

For starters, get the pickles and slaw ""bare snack"". Two kinds of vegan slaw. The whole thing is fantastic. It made the perfect sharing item for a party of three.

They also have so many toppings and sides that are vegan. The vegan sandwiches they offer can be modified to add these items such as chickpea onions and stout onions. 

My wife and I split two vegan sandwiches, Guadalupe burger and the Mazuma tempeh sandwich. Both were great. I especially appreciate that they make their own veggie burger. No Morningstar Farms here.

My boyfriend and I had bought a Groupon for this place in efforts to try something new for our anniversary dinner. This place is cute, small and intimate. We were greeted by a women in a T-shirt which I thought was odd because she was dressed if she was working in a pizza shop and not a restaurant. She sat us down at the table and went over to the computer and tinkered around with it. We assumed she was just the hostess and not the waitress. As we waited for someone to take our drink order, It was enough time that we  read the entire menu thoroughly twice. When we figured out what we wanted the women in the T-shirt was still at the computer  and no one took our drink order yet.  My boyfriend then got up and asked if she was the waitress and she nodded her head yes, so he told her we are ready to order when she was. She then took another several minutes before walking over  with some chips. 
We both have a gluten allergy and my boyfriend has a vegetable oil allergy. We asked the waitress if the chips were cooked on vegetable oil and explained my boyfriend was allergic. She said she didn't know and just stared at us. My boyfriend then politely asked if she could go check. She informed us are cooked in vegetable oil so of course he didn't eat them. We ordered a chicken fajita and a chicken quesadilla. The menu said have a choice of corn or flour for both items and we asked for corn. Our waitress was very confused as to why I was specifying corn tortillas because she said ""we only have corn tortillas not the flour ones"" I wasn't going to argue because I wanted corn. (At this point she still didn't take out drink order) She placed the order and returned and tell us everything is cooked in vegetable oil... So I asked her if we should leave or do you have any other substitute for vegetable oil and of course she said ""I don't know"" and stared at us. Again, my boyfriend had to asked her to go check for us. At this point I imagine the owner or manager got involved. He said he would cook everything in Olive Oil, and let me tell you the food was delicious! We were pleasantly surprised after the huge headache of being there. After the food came out we still had nothing to drink so we asked the manager if we could get some water and we ate. I can't say enough about how good that Mexican food was!  I got the check and the bill was $30.25 which was perfect because our Groupon was $30 and our card could be charged .25 so we could tip the waitress. (I always tip regardless of the service, some people have bad days) The check came back of wrong, not surprised and she took $25 off our bill so I showed her it's $30 not $25 so I hand her the bill to adjust it and my card to charge me the .25 difference.  She comes back the bill saying it was now $28 and we had no bill after the Groupon. I explained I only had my card and I wanted to tip her even if she did run my card for .25. She stared at us and said ""uhhh, I don't know"" My boyfriend said hey if you can work it out we will tip you but she said not worry about it. I did feel bad but my boyfriend even said, she made the decision on not taking a tip.
Pros- Great environment

While 9th street has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember I have never eaten at Ralph's.  Now, I must say from the start, that Ralph's is the kind of Italian restaurant that I avoid. Ralph's is an old time, red sauce kind of place: the kind of Sunday macaroni and gravy that I grew up on. But these days, I suppose I have grown beyond it. Having lived and studied in Italy back in the 70's, I experienced lighter, cleaner flavors in Italian foods. When I came home I introduced my family to these recipes. That was the end of the red sauce tradition in our house. The same reformation was happening in kitchens and restaurants across the country. This was the era of Julia Child and the great culinary awakening. Restaurants like Ralph's were old school. The wonderful film ""Big Night"" lyrically illustrates the two worlds: meat balls and spaghetti vs. shrimp risotto.
Recently an episode of Lydia featured Philadelphia and a trip to Ralph's. Lydia's enthusiasm for Ralph's traditions sparked a bit of guilt and regret. As an Italian American I had rejected and neglected long held culinary traditions. As a Philadelphian whose great -grandparents settled on 9th in Christian in 1885, I had ignored and concealed my history. I owed Ralph the respect of their kitchen.
Ralph's is a rather small space. Tables are close together, perhaps too close. You can hear almost every conversation in the room: some conversations not necessarily appropriate for dining. The room is very dark, but immaculately clean. The wait staff, all men, sharply groomed and attired in black, greets and serves with the utmost friendliness and attention: perfectly traditional Italian.
With menu in hand we carefully scanned to find the balance between traditional heavy red sauce and lighter fare. As we scanned the selections we also watched what was coming from the kitchen. No small number of dishes were bowls or narrow plates of red gravy that completely obscured whatever lay beneath. This was not the direction we wanted to go. Lydia highlighted the Chicken Trombino. So, that was our first pick. The reason for her choice became clear when the dishes arrived. The giambotta of egg, sausage and chicken looked promising. Although I knew giambotta as an eggplant and squash dish this version with egg merited investigation. For our third dish we went for the veal with peppers and mushrooms.  As a starter we ordered a cup of the"" pasta fazool ""(pasta e fagioli.) As usual, if you read my other reviews, we would share our lunch. Requesting the waiter to bring extra plates for sharing is never a problem.  I suggest it strongly.
The minestra, the ""pasta fazool,"" warmed our chilled 9th street shoppers' bones. In many ways, the soup is the indicator of a good restaurant. If the cooks are attentive to a simple soup, you know they will be attentive to the main courses. Ralph's rich and creamy bean soup hit the mark. 
The main courses arrived in properly measured time. We began with the giambotta. As I mentioned, giambotta as I knew it was something of an eggplant and squash stew. Ralph's version is what I would call a frittata. The portion was large and an easy share for three people. The sausage and chicken enriched each bite. But, there was one element that recalled the old style: green peppers. Green peppers tend to be course and biting. While they were a staple in recipes in my childhood, I no longer use them.  They have been replaced by fully ripe red or yellow or orange peppers.
We then moved to the veal. For the three of us at the table, this was not an easy dish The veal was heavily coated in red sauce and green peppers. It was just too strong. Nonetheless, I must say that this was exactly how my mother would make it when I was a child, and why, even as a child, I didn't care for it. The veal arrives with a side of spaghetti in red sauce. The spaghetti was cold and the sauce too heavy for my taste. 
Our last entrée, the Chicken Trombino, was suggested by Lydia and I can see why. The Chicken Trombino is not a traditional Italian American dish. This recipe is clearly something from a different inspiration. There is no heavy red sauce. The full chicken breasts are served with clean, fresh chunks of tomato and seasonings. The Chicken Trombino , in its light preparation, is what I prefer in Italian cooking.
It is very difficult to give a rating to Ralph's. Clearly, Ralph's offers foods with an Italian American history more than 100 years old. What they do, they do well. The restaurant is small but meticulous. The staff is elegant and affable. The service is prompt and the food well prepared in its own style. For many, Ralph's is a rich and hearty experience of old time Italian American food in new world. For me, Ralph's is an excursion to the past. But, is it really a past that I wish to recall?",2012-12-04 14:35:28,"{'food': ['giambotta', 'veal', 'chicken trombino'], 'drink': []}"

i had the watermelon salad and the roasted bell pepper with lentils.

the roasted bell pepper was ENORMOUS. i didn't realize how big and filling that dish would be. the bell pepper had some mix of lentils, raisins?, cheese, and whatever extra deliciousness the chef decided to throw in to blow my mind. accompanying the bell pepper was some kind of tomato ragout with a dollop of soft, i'm guessing, goat cheese. whatever it was it complimented the bell pepper fantastically.

The pub:
The area is sectioned into a bar area and a seating area. The bar was completely full when we came in and there were two decent sized groups in the seating area. The noise level was loud but we were able to still talk to each other if we leaned in and talked a bit louder. The lights are dimmed down but there are candles on the table that give a very warm atmosphere. The decor was very ""pub like"" and there were nice wooden benches to sit on for tables. 

The food:
+Bacon Grease Popcorn
We seen so many reviews recommending the popcorn so we had to try it. There's a reason for the hype. The popcorn was incredible. It had such an intense flavor from the bacon grease that it felt like if you ate the bag of popcorn, you would be satisfied with that as a meal. At the same time, I wasn't able to eat this popcorn like I would other popcorn or chips. My hand kept plunging in for more but at a certain point, I just couldn't anymore. It wasn't that I was full, it was that I think the flavor was almost too much for me to have it all in one go. This wasn't a big deal however. We took the popcorn home to eat and we managed to eat it over several days. The popcorn didn't show signs of becoming stale until the fourth day in and it was just left out, wrapped in a plastic bag. The popcorn comes in a brown paper bag with the top rolled down so that you get maybe 3/4 of a standard brown bag. When its brought out, dots of oil will already begin to show on the brown bag, almost as if it were a signature mark to an amazing snack. I would highly recommend getting this cheap and amazing appetizer and would definitely get this if I were to come back. 

+Roast Duck Sandwich
The roast duck was pretty good but I didn't eat much of it. It was my girlfriend's meal. It was a special that day and I think it was well worth it but I wouldn't get it again if we came back.

+Pulled Pork
I never had pulled pork before so I thought it was a bit dry. However, the sauces they provide you with go above and beyond to make this meal amazing. The three sauces are either vinegar based, mustard based, or ketchup based. My preference was the mustard then the ketchup and leagues behind is the vinegar for the simple fact that the vinegar was just a liquid and I like my sauces thicker. I realized I am not a huge fan of pulled pork however, and would not get this again.

The duck and pork came with sides:
+Cheddar Cheese Fries
The fries were pretty good but nothing special about them in my opinion. The cheddar cheese was nice but it wasn't too different from other cheese fries I've had. 

+Mashed Potatoes
These mashed potatoes were one of the best I've had. They aren't those pureed potatoes that you get from Boston Market or KFC. They were mashed enough so that they had a consistent... consistency but they were as liquidy as pureed mash. They had the skins on them still which I am a huge fan for and they were seasoned very well. The right amount. I would get these again.

+Baked Mac n Cheese
This was the best part of the meal, second to the popcorn. There wasn't anything too special about this mac n cheese and yet it was so delicious. The breading was just the right amount, maybe a bit less than I would have liked and the cheese was so very creamy. I would definitely come back for more. 

This was a nice place and I could definitely see people coming here with a bunch of their friends, getting some drinks and getting the amazing bacon grease popcorn to share. For a couples place, I think it was too loud but we definitely enjoyed it for a date.

We were completely disappointed! The two female staff that were present were unfriendly and had awkward attitudes which created an extremely uncomfortable environment. One of the female staff did not even address me in conversation and was only speaking to and making eye contact with my husband.

The case had a very small selection of cupcakes that didn't look appealing in terms of display or design. They were sparsely frosted with no special garnishes. We bought four different kinds and they all lacked some sort of quality component. The only thing pistachio about the ""Chocolate Moussetachio"" was the pistachio on top of the cupcake.

This place is definitely a hole-in-the-wall type restaurant, but it is well worth the trip over to south Philly. They do not take reservations, and even coming on a Wednesday night we had to wait for a little while to be seated. But the food was great so it was definitely well worth it. Plus it is BYO, which I always appreciate (I brought a six pack of beer which I thought went well with the food). Two of the people at our table have visited Cambodia and said that the food at Khmer Kitchen was better than a lot of the food they had there. We ordered five dishes including the appetizers and we were all full and still had some food to take home. Here are some of the best things we ordered: 

BOK LA-HONG: (~$7) This was a papaya salad that was really fresh tasting and spicy at the same time (we asked for extra spice on everything). It was refreshing and the raw papaya was nice and crisp. 

SAH-LAW KAH-RHEE MOHN (~$7.50): This was a curry chicken in a soup-like broth. I personally wasn't as crazy about this dish as I was about some of the others but other people in my group loved it. 

PLEAH SACH-KHOE (~$8): This was my favorite dish of the night. It was beef with lemongrass. It was jus the right amount of spice and had great flavor. I would definitely order this again if I came back. 

We were a little disappointed that the whole tilapia was sold out when we got there because it seems from other reviewers that that is one of the best dishes. I will definitely come back for it. 

BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a hole-in-the-wall inexpensive and authentic Cambodian meal, you should definitely come here. This is more of a place to go with friends than it is a place to go with a date (unless it's with someone you've been dating for a while). It is BYO and CASH only.

Their drink menu was on an ipad mini, which was pretty sleek. They showed you descriptions of the beer as well as how much of the keg was left. Apparently if your drink kicks the keg (i.e. empties it) you get that portion of beer for free. So there could be some gamesmanship if you like as well.

They had a ton of beers and one of the ones i tried Freigeist Abraxxxas was REALLY good, complex, and generally didn't taste like beer. quite good.  My friend recommended it and the waitress was impressed with my choice, so yeah, good call buddy.

We had the wings and mussels to start, wings were really good with the citrus kick and cilantro.  Unfortunately, the mussels were really salty.  likely due to reduction of the broth? or perhaps just tht was supposed to be the way it was supposed to be to pair with beer, but really, WAY too salty.

This place falls quite short of the old bar. The beer menu, however, is extensive, which will be a draw for many. I had a decent beer after describing the to the bartender what I was in the mood for. I am no connoisseur, so I definitely needed help deciding! He was great for this task. I then decided to opt for a glass of wine as my second beverage. There is no wine menu, he just brought out two bottles and I chose one. There was no discussion about price, and perhaps I should have asked, but I expected it to be in the $9 range, which I would find normal if not a bit pricey at a BEER bar. This is no Tria, so I wasn't expecting the $12 charge for the wine. It really rubbed me the wrong way. As I said, I probably should have asked, but with only 2 choices I doubted I would be paying that much.

I had three tacos--Mahi Mahi, pollo, and carnitas.  They were deliciously prepared and the (what I presume to be) homemade sauces provided great extra flavor. They also have Boylan's fountain soda which is really just to die for. 

And now, the airing of grievances (Seinfeld style):

1. The tacos are pretty small considering the price (about 4 a pop). I guess that might be so you can sample a selection of the offerings but no one wants to feel they're not getting any bang for their buck. 

2. It doesn't seem like there's enough seating to accommodate a lunch crowd. The turnover was fast enough and it wasn't an issue for my crew of four but I could def see it being a problem. 

3. There's at least one discrepancy on the menu (tecate is either $2 everyday or $4.50 depending on where you see it) that annoys me because I think pricing should be straightforward and clear. It just seems to me the error allows for a loophole of charging customers more if they're not looking closely. 

4.  Lastly, the power situation. While we were there yesterday, there was a power outage. I'm in no way blaming that on Buena since it appeared to cover a few blocks in the surrounding area but, the way it was handled by the staff left a lot to be desired. Namely, they just said ""sorry folks"" and watched as diners attempted to wait it out or customers who hadn't placed orders yet filed out. I would've expected some sort of customer retention effort. After about 10 min of no power (windows allowed plenty of daylight to see), no updates, and increasing heat since the air conditioning was off, we left, too.

They are the first thing I mention when I am asked about what I find great about this country, and I insist that they are better here than anywhere else. A good foodie city must also have good burgers, and Philadelphia does not disappoint.

We came to 500 Degrees because it is close to the Kimmel Center (Rattle was pretty awesome tonight) and because it is a place that pops up when asked about burgers in Philly. Besides, Bobby's Burger Palace was disappointing lately so we were craving for something new.

500 Degrees is surprisingly lowly ranked on Yelp, but similar to Bobby's Burger Palace I have the impression that it's actually due to its popularity. BBP has weaknesses - inconsistent burgers, occasionally horrible service and unpleasant atmosphere when it's packed. 500 Degrees also has its fair share of weaknesses. I thought their sauces was rather bad (especially the ketchup!) and while I appreciate their open kitchen, I didn't really want to see how their fries are taken out of the freezer instead of being freshly cut. On the other hand, their burger totally makes up for it. We got a ""500"" and a classic with guacamole, both medium rare, along with truffle fries and sweet potato fries. The burgers were cooked exactly the way we would have expected ""medium rare"" to be, they were juicy and both their cheddar and provolone went well with the burger. I should also mention that I especially liked the slight sweetness of the buns.
Despite being taken out of the freezer, the truffle fries are actually well-made because they spray truffle oil at the end, keeping the fries nicely crispy. Finally, the sweet potato fries were delicious but not overwhelming.

With 12.50 for a burger, truffle fries and a fountain drink, I thought the prices were pretty good. Cheaper than Bobby's Burger Palace at least. All in all, this is a place I would enjoy to come back to, because their burgers and the big choices of toppings come at a good price.",2012-04-29 04:48:24,"{'food': ['burger', 'truffle fries'], 'drink': ['fountain drink']}"

the mm naruto roll is the perfect roll for summer. it's a bunch of raw fish wrapped in cucumber.

Crazy! The food wasn't bad, but I hope it's better when you eat in. One day I'll go back and eat in, but not any time soon.

I ordered the al pastor dumplings and the miso ramen.

Dumplings: You get five. They were a lot smaller than I imagined (like WAY smaller), but it's very interesting to basically put al pastor tacos (my favorite) into dumplings. They were really good, but way too small to be charging $6. 

Miso Ramen: They send the broth separate from the rest, wrapped in saran wrap to ensure no spills, which was cool. The noodles were a little stiff and stuck together, and there was hardly any meat. This is unacceptable for a whopping $14 (I've had a comparable bowl that was way better and had thrice as much meat as Cheu's for $9 in Chinatown). If this were $8, I would ignore the hard noodles stuck together in a ball and no meat, but for $5 more than the other guy who's better, Cheu is being held to a higher standard.

I expected more from Cheu after everything I heard about it.

I like that the place has opened up, they knocked the wall that separated the bar from the dining area down. I also like that the prices have been lowered. 

We had early reservations and were seated promptly. Our server was very eager and a little awkward, but at least the effort was there. 

We started with the guacamole made table-side, which was delicious and fresh. We also had the queso fundido with chorizo and it was addictive! 

The entrees were a let down, however and that is why I cannot give more stars. At fairly steep prices, compared to apps, I expected greatness. We had the fried chicken with rice and it was bland atop some gummy rice concoction. Just meh. We also had a seafood special that was equally uninspired. 

I agree with Meghan C. that the margaritas do pack a punch and they are not too sweet, which was good for me. They also have some great Mexican beers on draft - my husband enjoyed a few Negro Modelos. 

Overall, I think this would be a great place for drinking and snacking, but the entrees are to be missed.",2011-03-21 15:03:30,"{'food': ['guacamole', 'queso fundido', 'fried chicken with rice', 'seafood special'], 'drink': ['margaritas', 'Mexican beers']}"

The servers are down to earth and attentive. All of the food we had was great. I had an appetizer that was essentially a vegetarian carpaccio with an abalone mushroom. It was so rich and perfectly balanced- it was a special but they're adding it to the menu. I had a pasta in a mushroom broth for dinner which was also fantastic.

This is the only non-chain/bajillion calorie eateries around my office; from our front door all I see is Burger King, Wendy's, KFC, and Popeyes....it's a food lovers wasteland.  It's nice to have an independently owned coffee shop and sandwich joint within a block of the office because quite frankly I'm usually too lazy to make my own coffee and would rather starve than eat fast food on a daily basis. Vinny P. just started working downtown, in exchange I moved out of CC for work and now I feel the pains of working amongst people that have no idea what good food and coffee tastes like. My manager knew what I was leaving behind when taking my new position in this neighborhood and immediately introduced me to Wired Beans. Skip the bagel but do order the coffee, it's La Colombe and has helped me to somewhat fill the void of the smiling faces I was so accustomed to seeing daily at Dilworth Plaza. 

I haven't been back for lunch yet so I can't attest to their sandwiches, but if they're as quiet during the day as they are when I stop to grab my coffee, then this may be my new favorite lunch spot when needing a break from the crazies that come through my office. The shop reminds me a bit of Central Perk on friends with its eclectic mix of furniture and the locals that are often enjoying their morning cups of coffee; it has a generally cofortable and welcoming feel to it and the staff is really friendly. As far as I know there's no credit card minimum, but I'll have to report back later on that. Free wi-fi, open mic nights, a kidlet section complete with toys, and a lengthy food and drink menu all add extra appeal to this cute shop nestled amongst Chelten Plaza. Where other storefronts in the plaza stay barren, this is the blocks shining star. 

If you're in the area, do stop by. I don't know that they are necessarily hurting for business, but this quiet coffee shop is a nice reprieve for those with chaotic work days and neighbors who need a little pick-me-up.

Unfortunately, the one lucid memory I have of Ruth's Chris doesn't even involve steak. I ordered a glass of Glenmorangie 18 neat, i.e. without ice. The waiter said, ""excuse me, sir, but I believe you mean to say N.I. ... en aye"" I threw him a befuddled look. He continued, ""It stands for No Ice. That is the correct term."" I could have gone on arguing back and forth but I didn't want to embarrass him. For the record, ""neat"" is the correct term. N.I. sounds like something from Monty Python's Holy Grail.

It was always a long wait but the food was great and service good.  I was back in town for a 15th year college reunion and decided to reminisce by coming here again on a MONDAY night for a good friend's birthday celebration.  When I arrived at 6:30pm - the restaurant had many empty seats.  We were a party of 5 but only 3 of us arrived early.  We were seated immediately.  The rest of the party came about 20 minutes later.  After 5 minutes - our waitress came over with an irritated ""Is the rest of your party coming soon?""  After another 5 minutes - they basically said very rudely ""Where are they?""  Meanwhile - there were still MANY empty tables (another table of 5 open) - I looked and there was nobody waiting.    When the rest of the party arrived, the waitress came over immediately to announce the specials of the day before my brother's butt touch his seat!  They're undercurrent was still hostile at best.  The restaurant did not fill up until 30 minutes after our entire party arrived and no more than 2 people were waiting at a time to be seated the entire time we were there.  I felt that the waitresses were rude and acted like it was some kind of sacred privilege to eat at Dmitris.  To add insult to injury - the food was NOT the way I remembered it.  The grilled octopus was dry and did not taste fresh.  The rest of the dishes were okay-good but not spectacular.  I feel that Dmitris is resting on its previous laurels.

I had no problems making an Opentable reservation a week in advance for 5:30pm, and when we walked in, only a few other tables were occupied.

The three of us ordered completely different dishes, specifically for the purpose of being able to try bites of everyone else's. The following is some random commentary on the dishes I tried:

FIRST COURSE
- Foie gras soup - I'll admit that I originally had some qualms about ordering this since I'm not a huge fan of foie gras, but this ended up being my favorite dish! It was  creamy like a bisque, and mildly sweet with a kick of spice, like Thai curry.
- Shrimp scampi soup - Also creamy and delicious. It tasted like lobster bisque.
- Pork belly - Came thinly sliced, which I was not expecting at all, and kind of resembled prosciutto. It was less fatty than usual pork belly, which I liked.

SECOND COURSE
- Octopus - Good, but really spicy! (The waiter said it was a 6/10 on spiciness, which is apparently the upper limit of my spiciness tolerance). It also came with string beans and crunchy chickpeas.
- Sea bream - My friend was unimpressed with both the sea bream and the pork belly that came with it. The calamari looked like flat noodles. Overall, mediocre.
- Charred eggplant - I only tried a bit of the eggplant, which was... just eggplant. (To be fair, I didn't try any of the other things on the plate.)

THIRD COURSE
- Pappardelle - Good, but it was a struggle to finish this because I was so full by this point. The pappardelle came topped with bread crumbs and bits of rabbit mixed in. The rabbit tasted surprisingly like chicken.
- Tennessee fried chicken - My first thought when the waiter served the dish: WOW this dish is so much bigger than the rest of ours - three drumsticks served on bread and coleslaw. The chicken itself was really juicy, but my friend thought it was under-seasoned.

DESSERT
- Banana split - Little piles of pineapple sorbet, whipped cream, bananas and strawberries, sprinkled with other berries. Pretty good, other than the rum (or some other kind of hard liquor) soaked cherries, which were way too strong.
- ""Lemon meringue tart"" - The name is in quotes because it's actually a deconstructed lemon meringue tart! The meringue was yummy.
- Praline Napoleon - Good, but the accompanying coffee ice cream was quite strong.

Overall, all the dishes were beautifully presented, but my favorites, hands-down, were both the foie gras soup and shrimp scampi soup.
