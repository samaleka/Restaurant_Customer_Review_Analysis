Came in for happy hour, had two abita beers, shared mac & cheese and the pork empanadas. Really great stuff and the total only came out to about $12 each for my friend and I.

I did honestly feel like the bartenders were all in a sour mood. Just asking a question here or there or ordering something from the menu, I felt like I was inconveniencing them. I was also disappointed because so many reviews said they have great popcorn and I was there from 5:15-6:30 and no popcorn was served. We asked about it and they said they would bring it out, and they never did - so womp womp.

I would come back for happy hour, just be prepared to not expect a warm welcome from the people that work here. No idea why the bartenders don't like the patrons!",2017-03-29 15:51:12,"{'food': ['mac & cheese', 'pork empanadas'], 'drink': ['abita beers']}"

Chinks is a small hole in the wall type place, but as many know these places can be the best cheat eats around.  The cheesesteaks, at a mere 6$ are GREAT.  The perfect greasy, cheesey and tasty fast cheap eat.  I have had many cheese steaks before but this is by far one of the better ones :)   Also, this place boasts an old time soda fountain that ranges from hand mixed flavored sodas to thick shakes and even really good egg creams, and all at good prices. Many places in my area and NYC also boast this sort of option however they make a big deal of it being ""vintage"" and specialty and they overprice but chinks is not like that...its not some trendy new soda fountain...its more of an oldskool authentic soda fountain experience, that combined with the cheese steak is well worth a trip back just to go to Chinks.

The servers are always really friendly.  The place always smells fabulous (obviously).  I'd say the prices are generally ""reasonable.""  Most of their food has a ""home-made"" taste to it.

1)  I noticed that the food (not the dessert food, just the foody food) tends to take forever to come out.

We had an early dinner around 5 and it was pretty empty but filled up as it got closer to 6.

We ordered two ramen bowls, two sushi rolls, and a vegan poke bowl for four people and were satisfied. The ramen was a great price point ($11) and was pretty good. Thought the flavor of the broth could be richer, but can't beat that price in this area. The sushi rolls were good although I didn't try nigiri or sashimi so didn't get a good feel for the raw fish itself.

I was not disappointed. Wise Guy's is good cheap and bad for you comfort food type of joint.

I got the Philly cheese steak. It was pretty good. Not a tops in Philly spot, but up their at the top of the regular Joe's spots.

I also got the Wise Guys fries. They are good fries. Then addition of melted American and cheese wiz made it better. A lot of it was on the bottom through. They could have done a better job melting it on top. The jalapeno peppers were nice. The bacon, to my surprise, was two whole strips of tasty bacon. As nice as fresh strips are, I actually wish it was more of an in bits type of deal. It's kind of hard to eat the whole bacon with the fries.

I also got the mac n cheese bites. These could do no wrong. The worst thing about them, there were not enough. And, they could have been bigger. But mac n cheese baked inside fried bread crumbs is heaven.

There's lots of good looking items on their ""I don't know what to choose"" menu. So much that looks good, and makes you feel just a little guilty eating.

But hey, we all need a little guilty pleasure in our lives.

Update: I had to drop Wise Guys to three stars (from four) after having their pizza. I have no idea what those talking their pizza up are talking about. I'm a New Yorker, so perhaps I am a little more picky. But, it was passable at best. I do not recommend it. You want pizza, go to Colonial.

Actually, we made a trip across town to stumble in, but regardless, we made it. Yes, it is just a sports bar, and there isn't much hype or dazzle, but we were expecting a LITTLE bit better in the service department. We waited over 10 minutes (yes, I was timing) for someone to even acknowledge my girlfriend and I, then another 5 before our draught beers were brought out. After that, we had a couple friends join us and our server had practically disappeared. We had to flag down another server multiple times to place another drink order, which I figured would be getting shoveled our way. 

One thing that really struck me as odd was one of my friends ordered a whiskey on the rocks. 6 bucks, not bad... until we saw there was an addt'l charge of 1.50 for ""rocks"". Yes, seriously. A buck fifty for ice. Now, I know this is Philadelphia and it's my first time to the north east, but crap like that makes it want to be my last.

There's something for everyone and it's reasonably priced, especially for a Steven Starr restaurant. The interior makes you feel like you've been transported back in time to a 60s diner, but with a modern flare. They take reservations which is always a plus in Philly. 

For appetizers, I've had the nachos and the hummus and pita. The nachos are really good, they're individually constructed so each one has a whopping helping of cheese, beans, and chicken. However, the portion is pretty small since it's just one layer of chips instead of a pile like you would normally expect. The hummus and pita is standard, nothing much to report on. 

Most of the time when I come I get the market salad. They bring a small clipboard with the options and you can check off whatever greens, protein, cheese, veggies, and dressing you desire. Recently, they've increased the price AND limited the amount of toppings you can get. Before you could check off however many boxes you wanted-- mine usually had like 2 boxes not checked.. I like variety in my salads! Now you can pick one protein, one cheese, and 5 toppings or be charged an extra price. It's still a good deal because the salads are ENORMOUS but I'm still a little bummed at the change. My most recent one (see pic) had spinach, spring mix, bacon, blue cheese, avocado, carrots, egg, black beans, chickpeas, almonds, and red wine vinaigrette. Delicious!

I've been veggie (not vegan) for a long time, and don't get me wrong, I love a good salad or vegetable hoagie as much as the next kid, but one thing that I miss is having the freedom to walk into a deli and have more than one or two lunch options - and choosing between different dressings or cheese doesn't count.

As soon as you enter this oasis, a blackboard greets you with a bunch of amazing veggie wrap and sandwich options - chicken (or, I guess ""chicken"" is more appropriate) Caesar, BBQ chicken, I think there was even a meatball sub. Then, to further boggle your tastebuds, there's a whole additional menu above the counter with tons more veg friendly delights. The magic continues in the back of the market, where there are cases and cases of super unique beverages and healthy snacks that are the same as what you would find in Whole Foods, but way easier on the wallet. I was able to snag a wrap and some coconut-water-mixed-with-unicorn-tears drink for about $8. Yay!

It took an hour and a half to arrive.  I live 0.9 miles away from Smiley's Cafe.  

My boyfriend was handed a sopping wet brown bag of what was assumed to contain a charming dinner for 2 straight from the Balkan tip, but could have been mistaken for a bum's malt liquor koozie.

This meal forced me to review the definition of 'gyro'  (i.e. A gyro [iro] or gyros [iros][note 1] (Greek: , gyros, literally 'turn') is a Greek dish made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie).  The meat in the gyros was bland, dry, cold, and quite obviously not cooked on a spit.  The chicken tasted and looked like it was boiled in water.  The beef had noticeable bits of synthesized Mediterranean flavor, but ultimately dry, downcast, overworked and underpaid.  Sloppily assembled.  I drenched sriracha and mayo on everything to find my stomach's way to salvation.

Grape leaves were fine, though I was resentful of them due to their little olive oil orgy they decided to have all over everything.

Shit happens, I get it.

People were fascinated when I told them what I had for dinner, since it sounds so random.  The chicken was great,  and the waffle was a nice balance of sweetness and super fluffy.  I was a bit taken back at the thought of the chicken gravy on the waffle, but it works.  For dessert, I had the pumpkin bread pudding, which tasted exactly what you would expect pumpkin pie in bread form to taste like.

I wanted to go out in the city for my birthday, so I picked this place because it was a good value (relatively) since we had a group of 7.  Actually, that was just a bonus, since I really just wanted the chicken & waffles again.  They don't take reservations, so we tried to go earlier on a Sunday (around 6pm).   They ended up having to stick one person at the end of a table for 6, which made for some issues with people getting around them.  We got the pierogies, potato pancakes and calamari for appetizers...  and promptly ordered a 2nd round of each because they were so good.  I again had the chicken and waffles and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I also like the beer selection, especially when we split a larger bottle and they served it in brandy snifters.  A few people in my group ordered some of their specialty drinks and enjoyed them as well.

Both times I enjoyed the decor, food and service, however I noticed that the 2nd time, the portions seemed to go down but the price didn't change.  I haven't been able to verify this for certain, but my coworker agreed that he remembered getting a whole waffle with pieces of chicken on top last year.  The 2nd time, I only got a half waffle, and it didn't seem like as much chicken.  Also, the first time I went I was amazed at how tall the Duncan Hines cake was.  The 2nd time, it looked about 75% as big as I remembered.  

I definitely say it's a place to try out, but not to frequent as often as you no longer get what you are paying for.",2008-08-25 02:55:55,"{'food': ['calamari', 'mac and cheese', 'fried chicken and waffles', 'pierogies', 'potato pancakes', 'calamari'], 'drink': ['beer', 'specialty drinks']}"

Best check yourself, before you wreck yourself...this is a seven course meal of pure deliciousness, including deconstructed salads, meat pie (an oddity, but very tasty), chicken, lamb, couscous, and dessert pastries. All of it is screaming with flavors ranging from creamy and savory, to oily and spicy, to fruity and tangy, to sweet and salty ;and all of it tastes freakin' fantastic. Thus, I am strongly advising you pace yourself. Everything we ate at the restaurant was so unique, each course deserves its own review. Thus, it will have to suffice to say that the meal was excellently prepared and even if the overwhelming amount of food could not be finished, it was taken home.

The Atmosphere:
As this was my first experience with a Moroccan restaurant, I'm not sure if all Moroccan restaurants will have this theme, but the mood was very enchanting, romantic, and relaxed. I highly recommend this restaurant as a place for a romantic or private dinner with your partner. Although passageways are somewhat narrow and it is difficult to see some of the surfaces around you, it only adds to the charming character of the restaurant. The owner and staff put out a true effort to make you and yours feel special. From the secretive entrance off South Street  to the rose water hand bath prepared before meals.

The Price:
The prices here are probably the most affordable you will find in Philadelphia for such a foodie experience. A seven course meal for two people (though plenty for 3-4) and two rose water drinks was ~$74, which included tip.

The Service:
The service was almost as intimate as the restaurant, as your waiter/waitress typically kneels or sits down before you, carefully explains the components of the meal, and frequently checks in on you. The greeting at the entrance was very personable; a few knocks on the ornate black door will summon the staff to escort in through the drapes and off to a very nice evening.",2015-12-22 03:34:18,"{'food': ['deconstructed salads', 'meat pie', 'chicken', 'lamb', 'couscous', 'dessert pastries'], 'drink': ['rose water drinks']}"

I had it all and learned to love it.  Seeing that this was a chain and one that doesn't even have a branch in Chicago, I thought this place would totally suck.  I told myself I wasn't even going to give it a try because there would be no way it would live up to my expectations.  Then one day I got a little nostalgic for the good ol' days, caved in, and gave it a try.

I firmly believe that a good Chicago-style dog is as good as it gets in the hot dog world.  Anyone who says otherwise is just plain wrong  Nothing else compares.  For the uninitiated, a true Chicago-style hot dog is a steamed, all beef, natural casing sausage placed in a fluffy poppy seed bun and topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomatoes, sport peppers, and celery salt.  It should never, and I repeat, never include ketchup.  Philly Dawgz really surprised me with a legit dog.  Sure it's no Hot Doug's, Superdawg, or Gene and Jude's, but they got everything correct, right down the neon green relish.  The even use Vienna Beef.  Very tasty--nicely done.

The Italian Beef on the other hand is not even close to some of the better Beefs in Chicago.  A good Italian beef beats out a cheesesteak any day in my book.  The meat is supposed to soak in a glorious jus of meat juice, garlic, and other Italian spices for hours and hours (much like the roasted pork you find in Philly).  The sandwich should be soaking in garlicky, savory goodness.  This stuff tasted like cold cuts were warmed up in a microwave in comparison--very weak.  The only saving grace was the giardiniera (a pickled condiment made up of hot peppers and various other veggies).  Boy do I miss giardiniera.

Overall I'm glad that Chicago-style food is being made available outside of Chicago.  Though for customers, a franchised fast food place probably isn't the best way to find out how glorious it really is.  Philly Dawgz is a decent option if you're craving some Chicago-style chow or want to try it for the first time.

1) The DRINK SELECTION is phenomenal.  If you're a beer drinker, don't fear it being second to wine at this wine bar.  We're talking serious bottle list and 6-7 drafts!!  Glasses all the appropriate size and shape, not kept cold, and beer the absolute perfect temperature for tasting.  Not bad prices either!!  Last time I was here I had the Russian River Damnation, which you'll be pressed to find at any other bars in the city.  Second - the wine!!  It's both annoying and clever at the same time that they don't organize the list by country, but their descriptions are witty enough to make up for it.  The bartenders will always steer you in the right direction if you don't know what to get; I recommend the Malbec they serve.

2) ATMOSPHERE.  You'll have trouble finding a cozier place than here during the warmer months when the walls are opened to allow both outdoor and indoor seating.  Dim lighting, slick copper bar, nice variety of people all enjoying themselves, rich and inviting decor.  I've spent hours here at a time and it never gets old.

3) Finally, the food.  Great cheese selection as I'm sure you can tell by the other reviews - reasonably priced, aptly presented with all the right   accompaniments.  Also, the bruschetta!!  Out of control.  I usually come after dinner so I haven't had anything more substantial, but whoever writes that damned Tria menu makes me salivate each time.

Pigbunny -- can I call you Pigbunny?  Because my wife and I do, all the time -- you are our neighborhood pub and restaurant.  You are warm and inviting.  You have many fine alcohols for us to consume.  Your fries are superb.  We want to come to you all the time.  At least, all the times when you're not teeming with douchebags.  (We've learned your rhythms and know when the douche rolls in.)  In short, we want to give you all our money.

But we can't, because you don't offer any vegetarian dinner entrees.

Don't even start by saying you have a cheese plate, or welsh rarebit, or a salad.  Those aren't entrees.  Those are sides and apps.  I find it impossible to believe you can't make a vegetarian entree.  I find it impossible because you've done it before: a pasta dish, a sandwich.  Something.  Something good and tasty.  You have good food.  Surely you can create something.

I might get that vegetarian entrees aren't big-ticket items, but you're turning away dollars.  Bar dollars, especially.  Sure, you're not making a lot on that spring vegetable gnocchi, but the wine and beer we consume would surely compensate for that.  More to the point, though: fries and a cheese plate aren't a meal.  You're basically saying that vegetarians just shouldn't bother.  So we don't, except for brunch, when my wife can have the cheese omelet.

The beer selection is small but tastefully chosen.  They always seem to have Old Speckled Hen on tap.  I've never had a problem ordering drinks even on packed bar nights.

If you're eating at P&K then you definitely want to have the burger.  It's pretty ridiculously awesome.

The decor was really nice and the bar setup was really cool. From the start our waitress was a bit off. She didn't know the size of the signature drinks (one would assume the $10 drink might be smaller than the $28 one. But it might just be the liquor). After we decided on our food, we were told the items we were considering were sold out (would of been nice to not get our hopes set and then be told it was sold out). Ordered the custom guacamole and red snapper ceviche. The guacamole is the only thing that made this review a 2 star review. I've made ceviche many times before. There was a very strong fish taste that not the guacamole, drinks or my entree could remove. Even as I write this I feel like I licked fish scales. GF got the salad which was bleh, dressing was bland. I got the short rib tacos. Short rib tasted like they took it out of a pot roast dish (no mexican seasoning) and the taco was impossible to hold as it was just too wet with the corn/cream topping. Our waitress never once came over to ask how the apps or even the entree were.

Waits can be long especially for Saturday or Sunday brunch and there are no reservations so be prepared to wait at least 30 min between 11:30 and 1. Fried chicken and waffles is my fave and brisket sandwich is excellent too (both around $14, I think).

I had the Hip City Ranch Burger with a ""Groothie"" (AKA Green Smoothie). The burger was great. The wheat bun was delicious, and the lettuce and tomato were fresh and crisp. The chicken tasted so real that I kept having that guilty feeling that us vegan/vegetarians have when eating meat - but I wasn't eating meat. It was tricking my brain. I even picked off a piece that I thought was ""fat"", but then realized that that was impossible because it's just tofu. They have completely nailed the texture, juiciness and flavor of chicken! Amazing.

I will be back again and again because the service was friendly and fast, and the food was mind-blowingly delicious. Even my non-vegan husband couldn't get enough.

We were heading to the Flyers game and decided to stop back in. We arrived around 5:40 with no reservation, we were greeted and sat immediately. This is South Philly so don't expect a parking spot to come easy.

Mark was our server and he was nice as usual. At times he seems to be stressed being the only actual server for all those tables. We started with the calamari Sicilian style. It was the highlight of my meal! The spice was just right, the calamari was cooked perfect. I was a bit let down that it was only rings and there wasn't much calamari only 6 or so pieces for $13.00. I ordered the chicken piccata. It was good! The chicken was very flavorful but again it was a very small amount of chicken for $21.00. The side of pasta was good but it was drowning in red sauce. My wife ordered the prawn and scallop special. It was over a white bean salad. The prawns were a bit of work and the scallops were a bit salty. But overall it was a good entree with a $29.00 price tag. Service was good not great. Like I said there is 1 server and 1 runner for 10+ tables at the time. The biggest plus is we got out 15 minutes before the game, around 6:45. Mark only stopped by once to see how the entrees were. Now, my biggest issue is refills. I was charged for 3 unsweetened ice teas. First off they are small glasses and I just wish I would have know refills aren't free. I hate that!!

Luckily there is still this location serving about the same menu. One of my teams  had a gift card that was long overdue to take advantage of so we set out here for lunch. Unfortunately they do not take reservations for groups at lunch so the 9 of us had to roll the dice. It was packed so the best they could do was two back to back booths after a 15 minute wait. This wasn't so bad except in the back left hand corner there is a ton of noise coming from behind a faux wall (that gets hot also) with dish washing in full effect.

The only difficult part to getting out here would be convincing my other friends that it would be worth the short trek from Penn's campus. Always looking to explore affordable options outside of Penn's standard offerings, I finally got a small group to come out to try the place on a slow weekend.

The Vientiane has a small storefront located along a row of other randomly put-together offerings, including a record store and a Chinese take-out restaurant. Upon entering the restaurant, there was a sense of warmth and community as the waiters and kitchen hummed along and the diners happily focused on their food and conversation. Stepping in from the chilly walk and the proximity of the other tables certainly helped set the mood too.

Luckily for us, we came just in time to snag the last available table. Promptly after we arrived, a small line began to form outside. As a side note, it's probably better to come a bit earlier for dinner because the restaurant only has seating for about 20-25 people.

The prices for entrees, about $8-$12 for most items, were in-line with what I was expecting and were pretty well-sized. We tried to order more Laos-influenced and less commonplace Thai dishes. We ended up sharing 4 entrees--homemade sausage, laab, sweet basil with chicken, and a pineapple fried rice--and stick rice, figuratively the ""glue"" to this meal as it absorbed the delicious sauce. The sticky rice came in these cool, little Laotian rice baskets which were used for steaming the rice. I'm sure the rice baskets are commonplace, but I was really excited to see them (*note to self: must get out more).

After the meal, we were all quite satiated and satisfied with our meal, including the bill, which came to roughly $15 per person (all-inclusive).
For my first foray into Laotian cuisine, I was happy with the experience. Compared to other Asian cuisines, there was greater use of mint, cilantro and spices to bring out the flavor in the meat dishes. My favorite was the laab dish, a warm minced meat salad served with chilis and mint. It is allegedly  also the unofficial national dish of Laos (I'm always amused where Wikipedia sources their information when there are no footnotes).

I would definitely come back for a lunch or dinner with a small group of friends.",2008-12-22 23:01:53,"{'food': ['homemade sausage', 'laab', 'sweet basil with chicken', 'pineapple fried rice', 'stick rice'], 'drink': []}"

I've been here several times and the attitude of the employees is terrible. The food is decent and there's a good beer selection, but I'm tired of being treated like shit by the too-cool staff. The straw that broke the camel's back was my most recent trip, when a group of us went here after work.
""Hey what are the specials?""
""They're on the board over there."" Points to wall.
""Ah, yeah I can't see those from here, can you just tell me?""
""I mean you can just walk over there... ah, well I guess there is [x,y,z]""
SO there were three specials. Three. Not sixteen or a thousand, three. And my servers idea was that all five of us should go stand awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant to go figure out what they were. If this was a pizza place I would understand. But the food is $15+ a plate, so it's not crazy to think that your server, who presumably enjoys receiving tips, could tell you the specials.
So I went to the bar area hoping to see the manager. I was told that he was ""upstairs"" and that ""he doesn't like to be disturbed. But I guess you could tell me, like, what the issue is, and I could like, ah, tell him later."" 
""Are you the assistant manager or something?""
""Nah, I'm one of the bartenders.""

It was an amazing dining experience - I believe we ended up with a total of 7 courses with a second dessert to go. Upon arrival, you are presented with a menu with 4 categories. You then tell your server if any of the items look particularly intriguing or disgusting, as well as inform him/her of any food allergies. Other than your few thoughts, the chef will be the one deciding the course for you. My recommendation is to chill and let the chef pick. I'm somewhat of a picky eater so this concept was a scary one to me, but it turned out to be great. 

Since we all tasted one another's courses, I got to sample a wide variety of the offerings. I had originally requested the sweet onion crepe and pistachio dessert and told the chef that ""I like meat."" While the sweet onion crepe was very good, I actually thought the squid and artichoke galette, which was served at the same time, was out of this world. AMAZING. Another favorite of mine was the stuffed guinea hen breast for the main course, which was served while I had the bronizini. The stuffed hen was soooooo good, writing about it makes me upset that I can't have more right now. I am personally not a huge fan of white fishes, so I feel that I didn't enjoy the bronzini as much as someone else would have. Given that I had mentioned that I love meat, this is the one small aspect of things that I was slightly disappointed in.

1. Vegemite- a peanut butter-like spread that is used on mainly toast along with butter. Sometimes you'll find vegemite mixed with butter but a true Aussie puts puts butter first followed by the vegemite.

This includes when they opened with a limited menu, while they now have a full menu. This is where I think Franklin's runs into trouble - it seems that they can't figure out what kind of restaurant they want to be. 

If you take a quick glance at their menu, you'll notice that the prices are slightly high when considering this is the same place that has among the cheapest (and longest) happy hours that I've seen in a while, in addition to $2 Miller bottles all the time. They have Skee-Ball, basketball, and a golf game in one half of the restaurant, then they have a ""regular"" sit down part with the menu that I mentioned above. 

The service is great, the manager is always friendly when I'm there, and the food is good....not great. I think they went overboard on the TV's, but that's just me. In addition, they have a good beer selection (including your usuals and some rotating micros/crafts). I think they need to decide, and pretty quickly, what kind of crowd they are going after and what kind of restaurant they are going to be.

It hasn't happened yet but someone opened one up in Washington West which is totally not fair since Good Karma is an easy walk from the awesomeness of Chapterhouse.

I'll forestall my bitterness for now and just be glad that I can stop walking a whole two blocks than before if I really must be at a coffeehouse that much sooner. Good Karma is BIG and bright and has a lot of outlets and WiFi. There's a large selection of baked good and drinks other than coffee and tea. That's cool. They have two nice bathrooms, too, and no one bothers you and they're open late. Could this be coffeehouse love?

The downsides are the food's not great. There's a sign telling you not to bring food from elsewhere which I must respect but I must admit to being a little sad inside when I have to bite into one of their moist, overly eggy scones knowing there are great ones out there made by our own Metropolitan Bakery. The coffee's fine, as far as a brew is concerned but as a fellow Yelper said, the lattes leave much to be desired. They're confused as to what makes a latte and what makes a cappuccino. I ordered one once and none since. 

But what can I say. I'll take the bad scones and indifferent coffee drinks for the genuine friendliness of the place and my face is as green as their mugs when I think about how spoiled that neighborhood is while my part of town is totally bereft of coffeehouse awesomeness.

We (my boo and I) pre-ordered 9 fancies and a 1/2 honey-ginger chicken to celebrate Superbowl Sunday.  Pre-ordering is KEY as we went in at 1pm and they had run out of fancies at 9am!  We pre-gamed our fancy donuts & chicken with some hot donuts - 1 of each kind:  Lavender-Honey, Indian Cinnamon, and Appolianaro (or something that sounds Apollo-y).  These 3 kinds were the sugar-coated, sparkle in your mouth type.  They all tasted similar, but the Apollo one was a darker, stronger cinnamon, the Indian Cinnamon reminded me of fall festivals, and the Lavender Honey had a nice clean taste, but you had to look for it.

Now the fancies that we're currently binge-ing on are freaking amazing.  I'm not one to order a dozen donuts every Sunday...I'm no donut seeker...but I'd seek these.  Every single one is so unique from any donut I've ever had and they're unique from each other.  The balsamic-raspberry is in my top 3...it's not artificially sweet and the balsamic cuts the sweetness with a nice tang...the ""halva pistachio"" holds on to the flavor of the nut and would be my #2, #3 would be a tie between the pina colada and the grapefruit with brown sugar.  We also got the caramel-banana and the smore's donuts which were definitely good but those fruity flavors aren't found in your everyday donut and the flavor keeps standing out no matter how many donuts I eat.  I keep eating more.  I'm still eating.  

We blew through the 1/2 chicken pretty quickly (the donuts are still lingering on the counter) and I'm not a fried chicken seeker either.  The glazed version wasn't sticky but thin & savory/sweet and the chicken inside the crispy coating kept the sweetness of the glaze.  After this chicken I loooooooooove fried chicken.  Well, maybe only Federal's.

Not a great location or space to have a fancy dinner or throw a big party. I would probably go with family or friends again just because it was the first family owned Italian restaurant of the united states, but besides that I do not really find it overall that special. Too pricey. 

Food: 
Appetizers: Escargots Au gratin ($8.50) The escargots were really large for its size, it was tasty but could be because it was literally all butter. I still enjoyed it, but it could be better if it was less buttery.

Entree: Chicken Parmigiana ($17.00) My opinion is it is a bit too pricey for such a common dish. However, it was a bit crunchier than other chicken parm that I have had.  Besides that I did not find it any special and definitely not worth its price. 

Black Lobsters Raviolis ($20.00) This dish was one of their specials for the night, not on their menus.  It was tasty, but a little too salty and buttery.  It comes with jumbo shrimps and capers.  The dish looks small, but very filling.

Place: 
Location: It is within a residential area, about two (or more) blocks away from South St (Main commercial area). I took a cab there and back (cost about $20). Not easy access. Residential area also means hard to find parking.

Environment: The place has tinted windows, so we cannot see from outside.  The moment you walk in you basically see the whole place, very small.  The tables are cramped on top of each other. I went there on a Tues night, and there was a lot of elders, probably not a young hip place. 

Price: I think the overall pricing is too high.  Two people: 1 appetizer, 2 entree and some fountain drinks came out to be around $60 (with tip).",2012-03-04 03:23:24,"{'food': ['Escargots Au gratin', 'Chicken Parmigiana', 'Black Lobsters Raviolis'], 'drink': ['Fountain drinks']}"

Black Garlic Wings w/ shishito peppers & herbs - this is how I fantasize wings to taste in my mind and lives up to all the raves. sharp asian spice profile with some lime tang, I have never tasted anything like it. A personal favorite, shishito peppers, are yummy to eat as well. I was a bit confused about if I should or should not eat it, but it tasted fabulous, so why not ?

Fish Ribs -w/ charred corn, tamarind & herbs - The corns were crunchy and fresh. Im a sucker for crispy fish skin however the fish aspect of this particular type of fish was entirely too overwhelming for me personally. So be prepared !

Thin egg noodles w/ egg, matzo balls & chile broth - The quality of the brisket is phenomenal and cooked to perfection. The broth is spicy and well seasoned w/ generous serving of noodles. Who knew a delicious matzo ball could compliment the whole dish so well. Also that matzo ball was no joke. Loved it. However, the spoon that comes with it is a tad awkward to eat out of. They need a different one thats more easier to eat with. 

Hand Torn noodle w/ lamb neck, pickled mustard greens & dates - This was my second favorite dish after the wings. The lamb melts in your mouth and its texture compliments the wide noodles perfectly.

I went with a coworker over lunch to try it out. Though there was a small line, it went by quickly. The menu has a lot of sushi options but the ""chef's box"" seemed like the best deal. $16 for 2 pieces of salmon sashimi, salmon over rice, edamame, and 2 rolls. Definitely a splurge for lunch but I decided to treat myself.

The meal is packed neatly in a cute little DK box. All the sides (wasabi, ginger, soy sauce, a spicy sauce) are in their own labeled containers. VERY aesthetically pleasing, not very environmentally friendly. 

This is what really annoyed me: for that giant box of $16 sushi, you get one little pea size amount of wasabi (pictured). Granted, I am a wasabi fiend but how can they possibly think that small amount is enough for all that sushi? I kindly asked for more wasabi and was told it would be a 50 cent charge by the manager. I can *maybe* understand if I ordered one roll or a couple pieces of sashimi but that was just annoying and unacceptable. 

The sushi itself was unbelievable. The fish was so fresh and abundant and the rice was incredible. Definitely way too much food for one person but would be perfect to split with someone. My favorite was the salmon over rice with spicy sauce!

::::WARNING::::

I am sorry for coming here.  It was the worst meal I ever had, and my friends agree.  I live in a Arab community in NYC and my boyfriend is Moroccan, so I know what Moroccan food is, and this place is not Moroccan. The Lentil soup had was awful.  People that rate this place 5 stars honestly do not  know what Moroccan food is, and I feel sorry for you, you do not know what good food is.  Myself and friends all got the runs and horrible stomach aches, and that is just from trying the food because we didn't finish it, we just couldn't.  The only thing I did like was the fries, that's it.  

When I explain to the Manager that I didn't enjoy the food, he was rude and obnoxious.  After we paid, just out of respect, the manager followed us outside and made a scene and told us to get the F out of here just because we told him that we didn't like his food.  I am sorry, but that is not being a professional at all.  I manage a restaurant and I would be dead crazy to talk to my customers the way he did.  He should not be allowed to serve the public.

We ordered three dishes and shared between the three of us.  Everything is served family style, plates come out as they are ready.  

Khmer Kitchen seems to be known for their Prah-Hok Kahteeh.  This is a ground pork dish served with raw vegetables.  This reminded me of Vietnamese lettuce wraps.  Very tasty, and worthy of the praise that I saw on yelp.   When the dish first came out, I was skeptical, but the raw vegetables do pair very well with the saucy meat in the middle of the dish.  

I think that the second dish we had was the Sah-Law Macheu Kahteeh.  This was chicken served with stir fried vegetables and pineapple.  The flavors were strong and worked together perfectly.  The one suggestion that I would make is to cut up the pineapple smaller.  That way it is distributed more evenly throughout the dish.

I think Cha-Ma-Reh Prov was the last dish, with beef in sort of a curry sauce.  The beef was thin and fibrous, almost like jerky.  My girlfriend thought it would be better with another protein, but I liked it like this, a different texture than you'll usually find, and it soaked up the sauce well.

We were a table of 4 on Saturday night experiencing the chef's grand tasting menu which was $135 a person. You are given a glass of prosecco to sip while looking a the menu. You have a chance to let them know if there is something you would prefer not to eat. For most of us, it was baby goat. Everything else sounded good or at least interesting.

 I want to give props to the sommelier. He was very knowledgeable about all wine regions even trivial ones that my Dad mentioned. The first bottle of wine we ordered wasn't to his liking so he wouldn't serve it. This was a $90 of bottle which he could have easily served us.  

 The highlights of the meal were:

-  fried onion pearls. They were like an upscale onion ring
- sweet onion crepe. So sweet and yummy.
-  Sea bass. This was the first time I've had sea bass and I liked it!
-   Beggar purses (see below)
-   spinach and semolina gnocchi. the gnocchi was the best i've ever had. it was almost too rich to eat

We were walking by today and saw that there was outdoor seating and thought it looked like a great place to grab a bite to eat, and we were terribly mistaken. We walked in and asked the bartender (an older woman) if it were okay for us to sit outside, and she just looked at us and shook her head and said ""no"". We were very confused, and she said she wasn't sure there were any tables for us to sit. There were visibly 3 open tables directly outside of the open windows/doors not more than 5 feet away from the bar. So we proceeded to sit down, and waited about 5 minutes to be greeted. The waitress did not tell us her name, ask how we were, but just proceeded to say ""I will be right with you"" as she put down the menus. 10 minutes later the bartender came out to take our drinks. We then waited about 20 minutes for the waitress to come back and ask for our food orders. No apology for taking so long, nothing. (keep in mind the place was FAR from crowded) It took about 35 minutes for us to get our food, which was mediocre at best. But then this was THE WORST PART. It was rather windy, and while we were eating the umbrella from the table next to us flew out of it's holder and hit my partner and mother, knocked over and destroyed all of our food, and the drinks all fell ALL OVER ME and my pants and shoes were soaking wet. The waitress did NOTHING TO HELP other than tell us to close the umbrella. Not a single person offered us help, napkins, or even IF WE WERE OKAY. 

I have worked in customer service and management for a while and this is inexcusably the worst experience I have ever had. When the waitress finally came back to our table after this whole ordeal, the only thing she had to say was ""do you want a box for your food?"". ARE YOU F*CKING KIDDING ME?! I asked for the check. She came back, without a word and left it on the table. My mother handed her her card, she took it and came back with the receipts. I asked for the managers' name and she said ""there are three"". I then asked for the owner, whose name apparently is Anthony. Once we got up and started walking away, the bartender than came out and said ""I heard you were asking for a manager?"". It was PATHETIC. 

I am disgusted with the level of service at this establishment.

Pricing seemed high on some items which I only realized when I was served a burrito less than the size of your average newborn. And while I loved the divided menu, I would have liked to see some fusion dishes that marry the two ideas together.

I won't go in to everything that went into this masterpiece of a meal. But some standouts were the first course, with many small bites, such as tuna crudo, foie gras served on a small crisp wafer, then the branzino and the house milled bread.

The waiter is a professional, knowing when to stop by and when to let us linger and enjoy our meal and animated conversation. He describes our wine with such clarity, I stop to wonder where he's been trained, but at the same time he's unassuming and likable and clearly enjoys his work. This is demonstrated when he comes over mid meal with an excited look to proudly say they unexpectedly got in some black truffles that morning, and sets down a small plate of fettuccini with black truffle ragu.  I tell him when he returns that I could possibly eat only this for the rest of my life, and be happy.

I visited PV on the second day they were open which worried me a little because sometimes places need some time to get up to speed. Despite some harried chefs (don't have a heart attack, guys) ordering around the pizza makers now and then, everything else seemed to be working (and tasting) just fine. 

I was promptly greeted by the hostess and was escorted to a seat at the marble counter in front of the large wood burning pizza oven. This is the place to sit if you can swing it. Not only do you get to see all of the pies made right before your eyes, you also get to peek at some of the other pizzas on the menu so you will know what you want to try the next time (like the one with the different cheeses and the eggplant one). Other seating in the restaurant (which is pretty small and fills up quickly I might add) also includes a slightly smaller counter looking out onto the sidewalk and parking lot across the street as well as a few large tables with community style seating (a la Stella) in the center. It's very kid friendly and informal but very cramped when it gets crowded. Kids can (and did) spill stuff and there's no worry about making too much of a mess. And if you hate kids it's hard to hear them over the 80's rap music being blasted (think Village People and Salt 'N Pepa) in the background. Kind of strange atmosphere looking at pizzas, seeing big photos of Italy, looking at families with kids spilling all kinds of stuff and hearing ""Aaaah, push it. Push it real good"" in the background. Maybe a tactic to increase beer sales?

Anyway, my pleasant server quickly arrived and offered me either tap or sparking water. I chose the latter expecting Pellegrino or something like that, but PV has an in-house bubbler like Zavino so they can carbonate their own. 

The menu at PV is pretty straightforward. They offer about ten whole pizzas (each has six slices...good for one hungry person or two dieting people). They also have one daily special rectangular pizza sold by the big slice, calzones, rolled pizza dough with pistachio pesto, and a few salads.

Wanting to keep things simple, I opted for the Margherita pizza. It came out quickly and was top-notch. The crust was very thin (thinner than say Zavino and a lot like Pitruco). It was firm and not soggy (like Stella) nor did it taste like a salitine cracker (like Slice!). It was nicely charred in spots but not burned. The sauce was good, not very thick but not runny, as was the mozzarella and the fresh basil. I did notice that in the chaos that started to ensue behind the counter that one of the chefs mistakenly forgot to drizzle olive oil and did not sprinkle sea salt on my pie like the other Margherita ones being dished out, but it did not seem to affect the taste at all. It was clearly one of the two best (if not the best) Margheritas in Philly that I have downed.

I managed to save some room for dessert and tried the cookie jar, which is essentially eight small cookies in a small white paper bag. It included two good chocolate biscotti, two of the best pignoli cookies I have ever had (sorry Termini's), two confectioners sugar covered almond cookies, and two pistachio gnocchi. It was a nice ending to my lunch and not at all overwhelming. PV also has fried pizza dough with citrus fennel sugar and soft serve as well. 

My bill for lunch was $24 which was not bad. I was a little surprised that PV charges $5 for their sparkling water (it's free at Zavino), but I guess someone has to pay for the bubbler.(which is not cheap incidentally). 

All in all it was a great lunch and I am sure I will be rushing back in no time. The food was great. The service was excellent. Granted, near the end of the meal it was like having a front row seat in that Gordon Ramsey show on TV, but I am sure that things will calm down at PV and everything behind the counter will mirror the perfection being plated and served on the other side.",2013-09-07 21:16:11,"{'food': ['Margherita pizza', 'cookie jar'], 'drink': ['sparkling water']}"

We started with the spinach & poached egg and beet salads, both of which were good. And then we waited for our entrees, the tilapia special with shrimp, crab and scallops. And waited... After 30 minutes we asked the waitress when we could expect the meals. She proceeded to list off all the occupied tables in the restaurant (3) and inform us that there was only one chef in the kitchen, like it was my problem. So we waited 10 minutes before I asked again, and she assured us they would be right out. But we  still waited and just as we were about to cancel the entrees, they magically appeared. The waitress apologized and offered us a round of drinks on the house. Maybe it was because I was starving, but the entree was actually decent tasting. Just as we were finishing the meal, the waitress brought us out bread pudding, also on the house. It's a shame that the service was so poor because the food was actually pretty good. I appreciated that she tried to make up for the long wait, but the whole experience was so unenjoyable that it just wasn't enough for me.",2012-05-03 01:27:00,"{'food': ['spinach & poached egg and beet salads', 'tilapia special with shrimp, crab and scallops'], 'drink': ['round of drinks on the house']}"

We've heard quite a bit about Izumi, and we're always on the lookout for GOOD sushi (not that many choices in this city), and since they were able to seat us right away at the bar, this seemed just perfect!

Flash forward 2 hours and 40 minutes later, we'd consumed roughly 6oz of food apiece. The kitchen had botched our order 3 times; the only way we managed to get any food whatsoever was when our concerned waitress wandered over every 40+ minutes to cock her head to one side and muse ""oh, did you not get your such-and-such yet? I'll go check!"" Only to put the order back in the kitchen's queue, not at the front of the line, where it should have gone. 

I take full blame for not standing up for myself and pointing out how ridiculous their multiple errors were. I'm not complainer by nature, but this was beyond any mistake I've seen in a restaurant. At the end of our stay, when the waitress sheepishly informed us that our last dish was ""still cooking....slowly. Do you want to just get your check?"" I told her to just forget it. We then saw them pull a raw piece of meat out of the oven and throw it away. We would have been there for another 45 minutes, at least. 

What infuriated us the most was the lack of offering to take something off the check, let alone comp the whole dinner. Or at least bring over something as a ""while you're waiting"" apology. I don't feel as though the world owes something to me, but I do believe in restaurant etiquette. The restaurant was crowded, but there wasn't a line out the door - it was just ""normal full"". As the tables around us were efficiently fed and turned over, I resigned myself to leaving a 0% tip (NEVER did that before!) and promised to  never darken their doorway again.

I give this place one star for 2 reasons: 1.) Yelp doesn't let you give zero stars 2.) The food that they did give us (a hastily ordered salmon-and-avocado roll and a spicy tuna roll - not exactly what you go to a destination sushi place to eat - just to have something to chew on!) was actually pretty good.

This is my second trip to Ralph's and as with the first, the food was outstanding. My hubby and I started off sharing the mussels in red sauce and when it came, I couldn't believe how many mussels there were! More than enough for two people, for sure. And so delicious, I wanted to lap up the gravy when I finished eating the mussels. Instead of doing that, though, I used the very fresh Italian bread to soak up a large portion. These were absolutely the best mussels I've ever eaten! I opted for the baked lasagna and hubby went for the manicotti. Let me tell you, I am VERY picky about my gravy, as South Philadelphians call it, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the gravy my lasagna was cooked in. To say nothing of the lasagna, which was awesome in its own right. All the ingredients were fresh and I'm sure the sausage pieces in the lasagna were homemade. My hubby thought there was too much cheese in his manicotti, but I think you can never have enough cheese! I tasted his dinner and loved it. We finished up with decaf coffee and a slice of tiramisu. Yes, I said ""slice."" The tiramisu at Ralph's is more a cake than the normal tiramisu you get at most places. It was the only part of our dinner I wasn't fond of. I guess it was the cream cheese filling that seemed off to me. But the presentation was lovely.

As to why I was considering giving Ralph's only three stars, the place is so small the tables are pratically on top of each other. Private conversations are impossible because you can easily hear what the people at the next table are saying. We even had to ask them to please move their table so hubby could get in and out of his seat. Plus, the tables themselves are so small, there was barely enough room for all the plates on the tables. And when my leftovers came back wrapped up ready to go, there was no room to put the bag on the table. Most people had their leftovers sitting on the floor. Not exactly sanitary, if you ask me, but space is really at a premium here. I managed to keep my take-home bag on the table even though I was sure my coffee cup was going to spill in my lap at any moment. It didn't. The bathroom is so small, when you sit down, your knees practically touch the door. It is impossible to turn around. There is no mirror to check out your makeup. There is NO sink in the bathroom--you must use the sink in the small common hallway to wash your hands while you make sure you're not in the way of the waitstaff carrying dishes, trays of clean glasses, etc.

Speaking of the waitstaff, they are extremely attentive and friendly. Thanks Al! We had a Groupon to use for this dinner that cost us $20 for $40 worth of food. With everything we had--one appetizer, two entrees, two Cokes, 2 coffees and one dessert, the total bill came to $55, including tax. Taking off the $40 we were left with a bill of $15. 

To wrap this up, food=excellent; service=very good; restaurant=too small with very close quarters. Will I return? Most probably. Is this the best Italian food I've ever eaten? Pretty damn close!",2012-03-05 02:59:07,

One thing just to remind society.... While the food might be vegetation/vegan. That doesn't make it 100% healthy. But I'm sure it's healthier than a cheesesteak at Jim's on South so what am I complaining about.

London Grille is a casual bar/restaurant with an older, quaint feel. It's decorated with frogs, which was very cute and different. My friends and I came during happy hour and the bar was packed, so we sat in the dining area. 

Happy hour specials were decent, and I noticed that they have a pretty extensive wine list. I ended up ordering a Chardonnay for $5-- can't complain about that. Other people in our group enjoyed Yuenglings and well drinks for $4.

Food-wise, I was not impressed. I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken ($13), along with a side of fries ($3) after being told that my dish would be on the smaller side. The Korean Fried Chicken was ultimately soggy popcorn chicken, drizzled in salty, chili sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds. It tasted about as good as it sounds...So despite being a smaller dish, there was a lot of chicken left by the end of the dinner. Definitely avoid this item. On the other hand, the french fries were pretty tasty!-- crispy and well seasoned.

I'm an evolving carnivore.  Non-meat options are gradually finding their way into my diet.  I've always enjoyed fruits and vegetables but, meat has always been a staple.

 I've heard mainly positive remarks and the promise of a Sunny Sunday prompted this suburbanite to venture into the city. HipCityVeg is a small store within a minute walk from Rittenhouse Square.

I was immediately greeted by a cheerful 20 something that eagerly described some of the customer favorites.

My eyes transfixed to an oddly written drink - The $4.50 Groothie (green smoothie with organic apples, organic leafy greens, bananas, & seasonal fruit).  I ordered same.

The Udon Noodle Salad was very good but, was suspicious of the so-called chick'n.  Why?  It tasted like grilled chicken but, in fact, is soy and organic grains cooked on a hot stove.  The Groothie was refreshing and flavorful.

Let me start with booking the event, Dave (the owner) was as easy as pie to work with, he helped me with every little detail. I'm a little picky, but he was patient as could be.

Casey, helped me create a custom martini as the drink special for my party,he concocted a delectable coconut, cherry, lime martini and my guest simply loved them, let me tell you Leah-tini's are delicious! Ask for one.

The food was simply incredible! My guests feasted on three courses of hot appetizers, we had jumbo garlic fried shrimp (to die for!), calamari with jalepenos (crisp, crunchy, full of flavor), steak spring rolls (beefy, cheesy, yummy), cheese fries and Dave was nice enough to add spicy buffalo wings to my party food menu for the night. Some of my guest ordered other items as well, the crab cakes got rave reviews!

The DJ kept us dancing all night with a combination of dance music, pop music and selections from a playlist I gave to Dave, I danced almost the entire night!

Most importantly the staff was the nicest most attentive people ever, the wait staff was always smiling, full of personality and eager to please. The bar staff never had anyone wait longer than a few seconds to place thier drink order. Even the security guard was nice (big dude-I wouldn't mess with him!) but he was very kind and cordial the entire night.

You know you can have great ambiance, food and music but if the staff isn't up to par it can ruin a night. I was so lucky to have these people here catering to my guests.

Let's start with the fact that you have to ring the doorbell to this place before even getting in. If that's not enough to make you feel like you're in for something unique, I'm not sure what is.

So I won't get into huge detail but the jist of it is this- 7 courses. $33 after tax/tip. You eat with your hands off of a communal plate so make sure you bring your friends who wash their hands after going to the bathroom. The occasional belly dancer may shimmy through as well.

This place is 3 stories high and I only got a glimpse of the top two. I have to say they were very cool looking and there were plenty of spaces for big groups. 

Ok, so I noticed that this whole review (which I was about to end) didn't even mention the food. The food is pretty good. I wouldn't go back for the food alone.

We had to wait a bit until a spot at the bar opened, but we were greeted right away while we stood by the doorway. We ended up eating at the bar too, which was fine with us! We were nestled by the window at the end of the bar, very cozy! Even though we were at the end of the bar, the bartender was very attentive and nice.
They have a nice beer selection which my boyfriend enjoyed! My interest was mostly in the food (of course) so we started with the cheese plate! 
I thought the size of the plate was appropriate for the price, and I enjoyed all of the cheeses. One of the grainy mustards was delicious! The other mustard is more of a Worcestershire sauce which cleared my sinuses, so beware! I also enjoyed the pickled veggies served with the platter, and the bread was to die for! Toasted and lightly buttered.
I was totally pleased with my dinner plate, the Caesar salad with fried chicken! The chicken was so tender and had a sweetness to it. The food definitely exceeded my expectations when dining at a pub. 
Overall, a great place to grab a drink and snack, or full on dinner!

I have had a strawberry and mango milkshake so far and have sampled lassi ordered by a few of my friends. Everything was tasty. You know when a milkshake is good and everything is where it needed to be. We also sampled the fresh watermelon juice. It was like drinking a watermelon.

If you've never had gelato and you like to savor your ice cream using small bites, this place is for you.

This gelato is delicious - very smooth and either rich or light depending on the flavor. I had the dark chocolate which was like eating chocolate cake batter. It was a little overwhelmingly sweet for my taste, but still very good. I have the coconut milk one as well which was creamy and was definitely the defining characteristic of gelato: smooth and refreshingly rich. The last and most surprising flavor was the grapefruit. It was my absolute favorite and I am very happy that I picked it. It was tangy, yet creamy and very smooth. I found it to be incredibly refreshing and light and definitely a worthy flavor. 

The flavors were reminiscent of European ice cream shop soft-serve flavors, which was very nostalgic. 

What I did not like: the price. It was just way too much. Sure they use quality ingredients and it is locally made, and it's trendy and a nice spot- but really? $7 for a medium (which is equivalent to about half a cup.) Not a place that I would go every day, that's for sure.

But sadly, there are better places to get donuts (Suzy Jo's in Blue Bell) and Korean chicken (Cafe Soho).  The chicken wings were moist, but insanely salty...  and I love my food salty, so for me to notice it is saying something.  I ordered half plain and half chili, and the chili sauce made the wings really slimy and they completely lost their crunch (good Korean style fried chicken can still stay crunchy under the sauce).

Their hot donuts are pretty darn tasty, I'd choose them over the specialty ones.  If I were to pick one donut of theirs that was stellar, it would be the strawberry lavender (had it at their Rittenhouse location).  Hot out of the fryer and bursting with flavor, it was a nice snack.  I'd have that again.

The only reason I'm not giving them 2 stars is because the staff are super nice.  That's worth an extra star for me.

Also -- be aware that this isn't a sit-down restaurant.  There are 3 stools at the counter and that's it, so plan on taking your chicken to go.",2012-12-07 21:49:59,"{'food': ['chicken wings', 'hot donuts'], 'drink': []}"

The food in my opinion is over priced for what it is- I don't mind paying a little more for above average food but this place doesn't cut it.

Got the fajita wrap and it was so greasy that the wrap was completely soggy and falling apart to the point where it was fell into pieces. The fajita was actually chopped up chicken (like you'd find in a chicken cheese steak). It was 9 dollars and absolutely not worth it- even to my ridiculously hungover want to eat something fatty and greasy self.

Next time got another wrap- it came with fried chicken not grilled- okay my fault I should have specified but typically not used to getting fried chicken in a chicken wrap. Also flavorless and at 9 dollars not worth it at all. The honey mustard was gross, the chicken was over cooked and greasy.

Next time- grilled chicken Apple walnut salad with mozzarella cheese. The mozzarella cheese was literally flavorless pizza cheese, the apples were completely rotten and mushy had to pick them out and toss them and the salad itself was wet so when the dressing was mixed in it was a watered down mess of a 10 salad. 

I give up on this place. Not to mention like others have said the owner is rude. I've asked questions such as ""does the Greek salad come with chicken"" and was answered condescendingly no it comes with feta. Um for 9 dollars without protein sorry thought I was missing something ?

No AC and it's 90+ degrees out?! There were fans all over blowing around the musty air.  All the poor servers were literally dripping in sweat, trying their best to accommodate an obviously unimpressed audience.  I felt bad they were forced to work under these conditions.  I didn't even want to imagine what the cooks looked like.  Needless to say my appetite was small, all things considered,  and I steered clear of the meat.  We were even told to avoid certain best sellers on the menu (ie: Lamb Sandwich) because the roasts were over cooked that day, and it wasn't going to be their best show.  Good to know....

They tried to seat our party of 8 in a room off the 'green house' before we questioned the heat so much that they prepared a table for us one floor down in a half furnished room that hadn't seen life since.... Eastern State Penitentiary had vacancies?  Just an observation.

We got our burger and the fries. At best, the burger was mediocre. It was juicy and on a nice bun, but otherwise a very expensive ordinary burger. The fries were also pretty standard. There were few and they were presented nicely in a little cup, but pretty standard. 

While we were full at the end of our meal and it wasn't terrible, it was just average at best. The bartender was a bit cocky about the food which also was a big turn-off.

Now, understandably, accidents will happen, and our server apologized several times. However, in my experience, if a paying customer is excessively spilled on or accidentally injured(!), it is typically good customer service for the manager to offer a small 'mea culpa' of sorts  - perhaps pick up my cup of coffee or my bottle of Pellegrino?  Nothing, which suprised me for a place I once considered a quality establishment.  

I found this to reflect very poorly on the 13th St. Tria and I probably won't return.  Its a shame because I've been going to the Rittenhouse location for years and loved it.

Got here on a later side of a Thursday night - there were couples everywhere making out in the cozy booth seats. I wasn't having any of that - I just wanted me some good burger.

My friends who were not (wo)man enough to get a beautiful burger got a little dessert thingy that they were still working on when I looked up from licking the last bit of burger juice on my plate.

OH and they have raw oysters, too! I have unconditional love for places that has raw oysters. Done. I love you, Village Whiskey.

However, I didn't care for the duck fat fries but it's just me because everyone else liked it very much. But that's because they didn't have the burger, I'm assuming. 

Honorable mention...the hostess that was working last Thursday night(Feb 10th or Feb 3rd - I can't possibly remember) - you greeted me ever so nicely and you took me right to my table so I didn't have any in depth conversation with you but you were the most pleasant hostess I've seen in a very long while..even working in that little vestibule with cold air leaking in from the front door, you had a genuine smile on and very welcoming.

From the low-key location on Leithgow Street to the doorbell you have to ring and wait to be greeted before entering. The interior is dimly lit and full of vibrant colors from tapestries and decorated pillows that adorn the seating areas. Our party of six was seated in a backroom upstairs - incredibly comfortable and got me excited for the meal.

The waiter first arrives and asks for very few decisions about the 7-course meal. We opted for the spicy chicken and then the lamb entree, accompanied by a vegetarian option for our one friend. We also ordered two carafes of cheap wine - $12 each. The waiter then returns with a partner carrying a giant metal bowl with a teapot on top. He asks that everyone puts their hands in the center of the table then pours water over them and asks you to wash up; a towel is placed over everyones' hands to dry off. They soon return with smaller towels that are draped over your laps in indication of the messy meal that will soon begin.

The first course is a three-salad platter consisting of cucumber and tomato - coriander marinated carrots and cooked eggplant in tomato sauce. They bring out a giant basket full of pita breads and offer you to take as many as you'd like. This salad was delicious and probably my favorite part of the meal. Next is a giant pie made of phyllo dough stuffed with scrambled eggs, parsley and ground chicken. It's topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. This wasn't well received because the chicken was sparse and the dish was too sweet overall. It was also very hard to eat the crumbly ground chicken and eggs with your hands.

Two main courses are presented - the first being an entire roasted chicken covered in a spicy cumin sauce. This chicken was delicious, perfectly cooked but the skin was not crispy enough for my taste, fortunately it was easy to remove. Next is a roasted lamb shank off the bone, covered in honey and slivered almonds. The meat was cooked well but like the chicken pie, this dish was way too sweet for my tastes. Finally is a couscous with chick peas, raisins and shredded chicken. I prefer my couscous sticky and salty but this was very sweet and moist, almost stew-like.

For dessert you are brought a plate of bananas, oranges and apples, a plate of delicious baklava and very sweet hot mint tea.

Overall Marrakesh is a lot of fun - you get to experience a traditional Moroccan meal and have plenty of time to relax and chat with your friends. I would have prefered less sweet and more savory dishes but others might disagree. Expect to spend around two hours eating. After wine we thought it was a bit pricey but still not too bad for the city - it came to about $37 a person including tip.",2008-05-11 16:46:48,"{'food': ['spicy chicken', 'lamb entree', 'vegetarian option', 'couscous with chick peas, raisins and shredded chicken'], 'drink': ['cheap wine']}"

The menu changes all the time, there are specials, there are events. You get a sense that the place is really happening. Especially the lunch post makes you look forward to dinner all day, it's a catch all. The fact that the place is still packed 4 months after its opening is a testament on how well the place is doing. 

I might have given an unfair review to Cheu last time, because they really just opened and haven't really gain a footing yet but what I like about Cheu is that they are continuously working on refining their dishes while trying to be consistent on service and quality. They have a liquor license now, which I'm sure makes everybody happy. The weaker dishes gave way to new innovative dishes. Portions seems to be slightly bigger and more satisfying. I find the willingness to please their clients impressive. 

I haven't tried all their new plates yet, since the menu change everyday, I have to time my visit but what I've had are pretty good. The fish ribs has become one of my all time favorite dish. Crispy skin with a slightly sweet tamarind glaze, while the skin is crispy the meat is not dry, it's perfectly cooked. Just take out the few bones and chomp down on the whole thing. My plate came with some awesome charred corn Elotes style, which I understand they are so good that they are now its own appetizers. 

I thought the scrapple was so good before but now they have added a mustard sauce with sweet cubes of melons. It does elevate the dish to another level. The mustard added some acidity and the melons added a great sweet contrast. Pig tails are nuggets of goodness, they reminded me of Chinese BBQ ribs except with smaller bones which makes them fun to nibble.

I thought the dumplings were ok, the stuffing changes everyday so some days you'll get better one than others. Since most people come in pairs, how about serving 4 instead of 3?

I have visited Rotten Ralph's several times in the past because I thought they always made margaritas well and I enjoyed their lobster bisque. The most recent experience however, was so dreadful that I'd never return. We came in and were pleasantly greeted. There was no room at the bar so we had to go upstairs. It was uncomfortably quiet upstairs but no biggie. We were greeted soon after we settled and our drink orders were taken. 2 margaritas and 2 waters were ordered w/o ice. The server returns with one water full of ice. We questioned it after he ran downstairs but. I could wait for my water. My friend had to move her car before 10 and we had set a 15 min timer for her to leave. That's how I knew the drinks were taking a long time. On her way out my friend stopped by the bar  to get someone's attention and to ask why it was taking so long since hardly anyone was there. She just decided to leave since she saw our drinks just starting to be made. We got our drinks at 10:03. 

While we waited for our food the server was hovering . I get that we were the only ones upstairs but where was this attention when we ordered our drinks? The food came and I had to ask for clean cutlery and my friend had to ask for ketchup for her fries. Being someone who has worked in the service industry, I feel like there are certain things you shouldn't have to ask for. He asks us, ""so do you want hot sauce too?"" I thought that was odd because what is the implication? We just want ketchup and clean spoons. He returns with a clean spoon and we have to remind him about the ketchup. I order a second margarita and the server comes back with a martini glass the size of a shot glass. Their glasses were already on the smaller side. I find it funny that he tried to quickly take away my friends margarita which she wasn't even done with so I wouldn't see the difference but I did and took a picture. He apologized and surprisingly quickly came back with the rest of my drink. He proceeds to do more hovering and eventually drops the bill. We payed when we were ready and the he informed us after seeing more than one method of payment that we would have to tell him how much we wanted on the cards. Why in the world would we not tell him that? We hand him the payment and I ask to speak with a manager and this is when things went downhill. 

I had every intention of paying for my meal and tipping my server accordingly. But what I didn't know was that the manager was going to add fuel to very slow burning fire. I honestly just wanted to inform him that despite such positive experiences I've had here, this was the poorest. I brought two of my friends here and as first timers they said they wouldn't return. (They had increased their prices last I had been there. I thought it was slightly unreasonable because I don't think anything about the quality had improved) I try and tell him first about how it took about 20 minutes for our drinks to come and he was immediately on the defense. He tells me that he is personally responsible for making the drinks and he knows for a fact it didn't take 20 minutes. He says ""I think you know margaritas aren't the easiest drink to make. It's not a quick pour like a beer; it's a cocktail"". Excuse me? I know how long it takes to make a margarita and I know a margarita is a cocktail. Mind you he tells me this after cutting me off and with a pompous attitude. I was quite shocked. So I proceed to tell him my intentions like I previously stated. (Maybe he thought I was trying to get money off the bill or something) I didn't want anything from him, I just wanted to inform him of the unusual experience so they could do something about. He wasn't getting it as he continued to be on the defense and take the stance that they were right so I was automatically wrong. I tell him sir I've already paid and he says he knows, he has my money already. It seemed to be a lost cause so I tell him that he doesn't seem to care about my opinion so he got dismissed. He threatens to call the police on me and I welcomed it. I haven't done anything wrong and we were about to leave anyway. Of course more words were exchanged and even my friends tried to chime in but you get the gist. Long story short, I left no tip, I will never return, I will constantly demote them to anyone who will hear me, the ""manager"" was rude, arrogant, impatient, irrational, and a poor representation of Rotten Ralph's and the reason why I will NEVER RETURN.ps.

I had the #46 steak and flank pho, we shared spring rolls, he had some kind of spicy Thai influenced soup with a variety of meats and hollow noodles. 

Glows:
Clear, fairly flavorful broth.
Good texture noodles.
Tender meat.
Fresh sprouts, jalape√±os, Thai basil.
Clean space and appealing decor.
Friendly service.
Reasonably priced.

Grows:
Spring rolls were just okay, and had an odd meat flavor. (Fake crab meat?) 
Pho Broth could have been more complex and flavorful.
His soup was lukewarm, not supposed to be.

We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  Our server was pleasant and attentive.  The food came out quickly (we had a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and entrees) and the spacing between each item was acceptable.  The menu had a nice selection and the specials had prices listed -- yay for that, even though I didn't end up choosing one of those.

My downsides are that the food was just okay.  I had the grilled hanger steak with mushrooms, onions and peppers and while I had requested medium, I think it was a bit overdone and tough.  I don't know much about that particular cut of meat, so perhaps I should have gone more rare (or perhaps it would have been okay if they had cooked it per my order).  It was tasty as far as flavors go otherwise.  My friends and I were also a little peeved at the appetizer.  Honestly, I can't remember what it was and it was good as far as taste goes, but there were three.  And there were four of us.  I think the server should have suggested that we order two appetizers, or talked the kitchen into giving us a fourth serving.  Three is always awkward -- if it's a couple or two couples, someone always either gets the shaft or seems like the aggressive appetizer eater.  Restaurants -- give us even numbers of appetizers!

I came here with my boyfriend and a couple friends for dinner one night recently, and sadly we weren't impressed. I'm a big fan of Asian noodle soups, so I was really excited to try this place, too! 

I got the coconut curry noodle soup which sounded promising. The curry broth flavor was initially pretty good, but it was soon overpowered by the huge glob of peanut sauce they put in the bowl. In general, I like peanut sauce but I found the flavor combo really weird, and the peanut sauce was thick and jelly-like in texture, which I found gross. I ate about half of the soup and then gave up. My boyfriend and another friend ordered the brisket soup. Neither of them liked the dish again due to the ""off"" flavor. My other friend who ordered the hand torn soup did enjoy her meal, though. 

On to the drinks...I'm not a big fan of canned beer to begin with, but I figured I'd give a new one a try. They have several options, but I didn't find any standouts on the list. I  decided to go with the Brewers Art brown ale which I found to be super bitter. I wasn't excited about any of the other beer options, so I decided to stop there. One of my friends didn't like the beer she chose either.

Also, the place is quite small and only has a couple tables up front, so the four of us had to sit side by side at the bar. It was hard to have a conversation with the whole group because it was pretty loud in there.

Finally getting around to writing a review... sorry it is long, but I know I find reviews with specific recommendations helpful, so read on if you would like to hear them!  If not, then here's the short review: GO HERE!

First of all, as a vegetarian, the dishes are rather expensive (more expensive than the meat dishes, which is odd).  However, they are DELICIOUS... well-seasoned, nourishing, large portions of goodness.  They range from $14 to $15.50 or so.  There are a lot of non-vegetarian dishes, ranging from $9 or so to maybe $15.  We have not tried any appetizers or tacos.  HOWEVER- between Yelp Deals and Groupon, it is not difficult to find a $15 for $30 or $10 for $20 deal, which more than makes up for the prices.  

First time we went, I got the Mexican Seitan dish (seitan being one of my favorite meat alternatives) and was highly pleased.  My boyfriend had the vegetarian enchiladas, so that we could share each others' meals... it was, perhaps, even better (though both were excellent).  Even the cute little pyramid of rice and little pile of beans were superbly seasoned.  Now, other vegetarians, do be careful- mention you are vegetarian.  The Chile Relleno dish in the vegetarian section was one of the things I was looking at, and when I asked the waitress for vegetarian suggestions, she mentioned that sometimes they put some animal fat in that dish- though she suggested it would be possible to just ask to make sure they would keep it vegetarian.  I really appreciated her honesty and knowledge about the dishes!  The chips and tomatillo salsa (which I normally don't like) were excellent- so fresh and yummy.  I was having a rough day, so we got a dessert to share to cheer me up... the Banana Crepes.  UNBELIEVABLE.  So tasty... we would have gone back just for that.  AND, if you check in on Yelp, you get a free dessert!!!

Second time, we tried brunch, which they have on Saturdays and Sundays till perhaps 3:00.  Our meals (some vegetarian omelet and Heuvos Rancheros for the BF) were quite good- not as good as the dinners/lunches we've had, but still very good- and were all under about $11.  This is a great time to use the $10 for $20 deal... you can get two brunch entrees for about $20.  But don't be like us and expect to use it on a Saturday- the Yelp Deal doesn't work on Fridays and Saturdays!

And now for the time we just got back from- we had our Groupon Now, which was good until 3:00 PM, and we didn't get out until about 2:20, so we were pushing it.  Our waiter offered to ring us up early to make sure we were able to use our Groupon, and was super friendly and gracious about it.  We took advantage of our savings to each get a Cafe de Olla (sweet spiced coffee).  SO GOOD.  When we inevitably come back for a brunch, you bet we will be getting that again.  Be warned, it is quite sweet- but I just loved it.  I got the vegetarian enchiladas again, but the BF got some pork tips with avocado dish, which he said was extremely delicious and satisfying.  We ended up getting our food so quickly that we were done by 3:00 anyway- but we sat around for a bit sipping our delicious coffees and remarking on how happy the meal (which we now have leftovers of) made us!

In short, GO HERE!  We are always nervous when the small space is so empty, and would love to see it getting more business.

I walk dogs in Red Hook's neighborhood so I often find myself nearing the end of the day in need of a pick me up or warm up within blocks of this gem.  

The decor is amazing and welcoming.  Really cute and comfortable furniture lines one wall while a bar with chairs lines the windowed wall.  The employees are NICE, something oddly lacking in a lot of Philly coffee shops.  They are also talented baristas and my drinks are consistent and damn tasty.  My favorite drink is their seasonal Ancho Chile Hot Chocolate- my god! It's pricey but you can taste why.

I've also had plain coffee, of which you have a choice of roasts, and a few other fancy coffees.  Someday I'l try one of their paninis or vegan sweets and see if they are worthy of a fifth star.  

One time I stupidly spilled a large portion of my drink while trying to add cream and sugar  with the same hand I was using to hold a dog leash(did I mention you can take your doggie here).

One of my girlfriends took me here to celebrate the 25th year with expensive burgers and gimlets. We sat at the bar and had a fabulous night. Our bartender (I don't remember his name) humoured us the entire night! What a great guy. We found out that we are all neighbors and that he likes to cook meat underground in his backyard! He even showed us pictures on his iphone. So much better service than I have had here in the past. 

Our fabulous bartender let me drink my gimlet in a coup, which was great...because they obviously taste better that way. 

The burgers are still good, but I have reasoned that they arent as good as they could be because you really cant eat them with your hands. You have to go with the knife  and fork approach, which is fine...but not quite burgerish. 


We also had the fries and cheese sauce, which I will say was probably worth the $18 dollars or whatever we paid for it.

Price: You can spend a small fortune if you so desire, but sticking to only a pasta dish and sharing a dessert is a surprisingly affordable meal that ranks in the echelon of the most expensive meals Philly has to offer... it is really that good. 

The decor is... who cares? It's a small hole in the wall chef/owner ran operation where you sit elbow to elbow with vibrant patrons who take their time and obviously enjoy conversation and good food. I think there is even a window unit air conditioner.  If you come here, you take your time and appreciate your company and the chef's banter, not the Stephen Starr Disneyland theme park. 

Food: The fresh pasta is really the star and he makes the fluffiest gnocchi out of any I have had. His ricotta is simplicity in form and along with the quality EVOO gets you excited for what else might come. The fish entrees are always perfectly cooked, seasoned, dressed, selected... keep going with qualifications, they are all met. His red sauce is so simple and light but unbelievably flavorful it confuses you. Dessert options are usually limited but I would never order anything other than the cannoli ... using his fresh ricotta with studs of chocolate and a perfectly crunchy shell beats anything from a bakery (note: if I recall, he does not make the shells). Try it if you dare. 

The portions are not large but I wouldn't call them small either... you will go home satisfied. As another reviewer mentioned, I can appreciate a properly sized portion. 

Bullet points: Homemade pasta, homemade sauces, homemade cheese (not all of course)... not a single item is ever off target from the appetizers to the desserts.

Went twice on one night so I was able to experience two aspects of the place. The first time was pre-game for an event we had at the Laurel Hill Cemetery. We stood at the bar. The bar itself is very small and I felt like I was crowding the people sitting at the high top table behind me. The bartender was very nice but could have used more knowledge of the beer selection. They didn't seem to know much about the style of the beer. 

The second time was after the event. We were running late and I called to let them know (we had reservations at 9) and they were very pleasant and accommodating. When we arrived we sat at a table. One of the first things you notice is the pizza oven with Pizza's constantly going in and out of it. So we had to order pizza and really it's the only thing I've ordered and all I can say is fantastic.  We split two pizza's and took the rest home. We got the Marcherita pizza with white anchovy. The anchovies weren't your typical little salty fish, no, they were large semi-salty fish and the pizza was delicious. The other pizza,which we liked alittle better was the Mushroom and Zucchini, really great mushroom taste.

Crab fries are a staple.  Lobster white pizza is always great.  Mussels in white garlic sauce, yes please, I will take all the bread you can give me to eat this delicious broth.  My favorite of all time at Chickie's is the McGooby sandwich.  A great roll, with chopped onion and pickle.  They then top that with steamed and peeled shrimp.  On top of that goes some crab fries, and on top of that goes the patented Chickie's cheese sauce.  It is a great balance of cold and hot in a seafood sandwich.  Can it complete with the lobster rolls of New England, maybe... I would like to think so.

Beautiful views if you have a window seat, other than that you are either facing the restaurant or too low to see the views. We made a reservation a week before so understandably they couldn't seat us at the window but it was a Wednesday night and there were raised/better view booths open the entire time we were there. IMO, seat your reservations at the best possible tables esp for birthdays/anniversaries.

We arrived at 7:27 for a 7:30 reservation. The hostess asked us to sit at the bar while they were getting our table ready. We sat at the bar no problem, great views, cool ice block, views of the sous chefs, lots of things to look at and talk about. Bartenders were attentive and friendly. We each ordered a basic drink. About 7:40 the hostess came over and said our table was ready. I asked should we close out our tab or can we just transfer it? I asked knowing she was probably going to say they will transfer it but I used to be a bartender and did not want to stiff this guy on a tip. She said ""leave your drinks here and your waitress will bring them over."" We thought, oh how fancy. Thinking they didn't want us walking around with drinks in our hands. Meanwhile we walked by 3-4 people with ripped jeans, white sneakers, some interesting attire.. My husband said ""I guess they don't enforce the dress code""

We were seated and waited, and waited, now our drinks are about 15 feet behind us and we have not been greeted by the waitress. Some time goes by and I turned to the look at the bar and saw the bartender going to grab our drinks and then with a confused face looking around the restaurant. So my husband jumped up and grabbed our drinks from the bar before he dumped them out. It was just an odd encounter that really nobody is at fault but we would have happily brought our drinks with us. A few minutes later our waitress comes by and asked us if we want bottled, sparking, or ice water. We opted for the ice water.

We decided to go without appetizers since we ALWAYS fill up on appetizers too quickly. My husband ordered the 20oz Ribeye w/ potatoes and I ordered the Crisp Pork Osso Bucco. We also ordered mac n cheese to share. Both entrees were very good! The mac n cheese was pretty good, not as good as those potatoes, yum!

Here's where we get to 3 stars, the overall service. The waitress came over pretty quickly after the food was dropped off, I think I had taken one bite and asked how everything was, ""good"" we said. We didn't see her again for a lonnggg time. Well we saw her running by us about 25 times, but she never filled our water or asked if we wanted another cocktail, or if we needed anything at all. Now I am all about not being bothered but just come by and check our water glasses. My husband's glass was bone dry for about 20 minutes and I let him have the rest of mine. I am not one to wave a waitress down... She seemed really busy. We have been to a lot of restaurants (Butcher and Singer, Barclay Prime, Waterworks, Sotto Varalli to name a few) and all those places have a person that goes around and fills water glasses, and clears the table of extra stuff (unused wine glasses, take bread plates, etc). This person didn't exist or they just never came around.

I was just surprised that a few details were overlooked. Am I being picky? Yes, bc I am writing a Yelp review. Am I losing sleep over this place and wishing we didn't spend $165? No. I just want people to know that if you are expecting over the top service you will not get it here. You will get a cool atmosphere and good food. So for me that is worthy of 3 stars. :) 

TL;DR - Must reserve a window booth or you are missing out, expect decent service but not exceptional, food is good but nothing that I can see us craving to have again like my husband and his Delmonico at Butcher and Singer that I never stop hearing about....haha",2015-04-16 16:45:40,

Happy hour is a great deal. It goes from 5-7pm every day for $5 margaritas, $3 draft beer specials, and $6 Guero specials-- I had myself a marg, and it is a very stiff drink, so perfect if you've had a tough day at work or just want an early start to the night.  

Good guac is difficult to find on the East Coast, but Xochitl is known for its fresh guac with cotija cheese, prepared tableside with mortar and pestle. Chunky, delicious, and it's got a little bit of a kick to it if you let them add the red peppers (you can always request that they leave them out, but they don't make the guac overwhelmingly spicy).   

If you're getting guac anyway (and why wouldn't you?), note that the ""El Sabor"" special is offered daily, and it's a steal as long as the entire table has enough of an appetite for it. For $32, each person gets the guac, along with an appetizer and an entree (no menu item off limits). We weren't hungry enough to for it when we came, but the next time I know I'm coming to Xochitl, I'll try to plan ahead a little better to take advantage of this prix fixe option. 

For an entree, I got the Salmon marinated in achiote (a reddish seed with a bit of an earthy flavor) served over poblano crema,fava beans, and yuca tots. The fish was perfectly cooked... juicy but with a little bit of crispiness on the outside, and everything else was also tasty.

I ordered a cheeseburger med-rare with truffle fries and a black & white milkshake. Since all of these combined is pretty much my favorite thing I ever I was more than willing to hand over the $12 for the opportunity. Okay, now the food:

1) The burger. It's not like the burger isn't good, because it is. It's just not...I find myself saying ""Five Guys"". I admit I don't have the most refined of palettes so take that with a grain of salt. It came out more medium than medium rare and it's somewhat small. I can tell that it's quality meat but I like my burgers juicy and this one just isn't quite. The bun is also a huge factor for me in a burger and I just don't like this style. (Id dock Good Dog for the same reason. Love the meat but the bun just doesn't cut it for me). 

2) The truffle fries. Omfg. The best part of the meal. The fries are amazing. I'd probably just pop in and buy them on their own. And at this price I don't see myself ordering truffle fries from any other establishment ever again.

3) The milkshake. Boy do I love me a Black & White. This one was just too chocolate-y for my liking. It tasted much more like just a regular chocolate milkshake which in and of itself isn't such a bad thing except for when what you really want is the holy, blended harmony of rich heavy chocolate and light as air and sweet as pie vanilla.

We ordered their Indian pancake Roti Canai. Since it was to go so it probably got a little cold, so it was a little chewy and hard to tear off. None the less the curry sauce was fab. The two dishes we ordered were Bean curd Thai style and Beef Rendang. The vegetable Thai dish was great! It left a good aftertaste of spiciness in my mouth, portions were huge, the sauce was a little unhealthy - but what more can you expect when you eat out. I also really enjoyed their Beef Rendang very much, the beef was tender, a little heavy, but sauce was fantastic, again a little oily. 

We also ordered a small size of coconut rice, and that was enough for two. Had leftovers from both our dishes for the next day.

Now, months later, I finally made another visit due to an extreme burger craving.  The burger definitely hit the spot, but the experience was almost ruined by the fries.  Not sure why I'm reading so many rave reviews for the truffle fries because mine were so greasy and salty that I needed my milkshake constantly.  I still ate the fries, mind you, but I feel I may regret it later.  I was trying to give them their due because of the rave about them and I'd never had truffle fries before, but the salt and oil made it too hard to distinguish any significant difference from regular fries.  I think the shake could've used a bit more strawberry also, because it often tasted plain with just hints of strawberry, although that may have been the result of the salty-ass fries.  Oh, and $12.50 plus tax for a cheddar cheeseburger, truffle fries and a shake?  I dunno... it's really just a step above typical fast food, maybe two steps actually, so the price is about right for the location.   While I'm not an aficionado, I do get the occasional craving and have had my share of good burgers.  I didn't expect it to be as pink as it was inside when I ordered medium but it was juicy and tasty.  I may go back to give them another chance to get the fries right, but the burger was on point.  The portions were just right too.  Just the right amount of fries, over a quarter pound of meat and a good size shake (maybe 16oz?).  If you don't get the combo, the burger alone might be a bit underwhelming at glance but I think American portions are too big anyways generally.  I'm 6 feet tall, 190lbs and I was full after the combo, without getting the ""itis.""

Although pricey, we were hapy to find a new place to make it a regular in our list of restaurants.  The food for the family is below:
 
Japanese Mojito: 5 Stars.  Refreshing and not too stiff!  I probably could have had many of these, but stuck with one.

3 piece Dumpling Soup: 2 Stars.  Bland, dumplings I could find anywhere, did not finish.

Mango Soft Shell Crab Salad:  5 Stars.  The best food of the night.  The description is Mango, Crab Meat, Seaweed Salad, Lettuce, Avocado Salad and Masago on the Bottom, Whole Soft Shell Crab on Top.  This could have been a meal by itself.  Extremely tasty and just the right amount of sizzling crab on top with an amazing sauce.

Duck Rolls: 4 Stars.  Wonderful with no grease taste - Deep Fried Roasted Duck and Taro Finished with Sweet Soy and Honey Wasabi Sauce.  I expected duck meat pieces, but it was more of a hamburger meat texture.  Still, very tasty!

I Phone 4S Roll: 3 Stars.  Felt like it was warmer-than-room temperature which was a bit off putting.  Also, I had so much food that I probably did not enjoy it as much as I should have.  Crunchy Spicy Crab with Seared Sea Scallop on top.  

Teriyaki Bento Box Salmon:  3 Stars.  Comes with Salad, Soup, Rice, California Roll, Shrimp Tempura, Shumai, Fruit.  Wife said there was too much tempura in the box with the vegetables, and did not finish it.  However, the salmon was very tasty, and she did not like the California Roll.  Fruit was 1/2 an orange.  The tempura shrimp was really nice, though.

I was going to order from where I always do, but they were closed so I decided to try out Erawan. I should have just chosen somewhere else, because I was pretty disappointed.

I ordered a pad thai (2 spice) and a tom yum soup with chicken (3 spice). I placed my order at 4pm, but it came at 6pm. Seriously, 2 hours for a quick stir fry and a soup? Not to mention that my delivery address was 3 minutes away by car.
I was extremely hungry by then so I was expecting a meal that was worth the ridiculous wait. The tom yum soup was pleasantly spicy, and had the right amount of sourness to it. The chicken, however, was stone-hard when I rescued it from the bottom of the soup container. It was WAY overdone, and had no flavor whatsoever. Next time the cook should season the meat before he/she dumps it into the soup.

I was much more disappointed by the pad thai. The noodles were just overcooked and soggy. It felt like I was eating senior food because it was so soft. The sauce was also terribly bland, and I had to grab some soy sauce and chili sauce from my cupboard to give it some flavor. Also, there was absolutely no spice whatsoever, despite my specifying for a 2-level spice. I don't know why people have been raving about their pad thai.

Tasting notes for brunch:
-Shrimp and grits: well-salted shrimp in cheesy grits with cubes of ham and pepper in a red, savory broth. Egg on top is fried with crispy edges. Comes with two slices of either potato or whole grain toast. Potato toast was browned on both sides, a little on the dry side, but not bad for mopping up grits and broth. 

Impression: food is alright, nothing spectacular, a bit disappointing. On top of a 50-minute wait, I can only say this place is okay.

The valet folks was attentive and polite. We arrived about 8:50 PM and the doors were to open at 9:00 PM.  We purchased ""fast pass"" tickets which we hoped would reduce the wait outside.  As we stood in line there was a obvious confusion in the crowd about where the line was for VIP, Fast pass or general admission.  Finally by word of mouth we found the VIP/fast pass line and got in around 9:35 PM.  The general admission line was not even moving which made me think they must have not got in till after 10:00 - 10:30 PM.

Unfortunately, the coat check area was holding up the lines which was greatly understaffed. There was only person working frantically to get people's coats checked.  As we finally made it into the club we are impressed with the layout and decor.  According to the tickets we bought they were supposed to have open bar from 9 -1 AM, food (buffet / horderves not sure which one) and Champagne to toast at midnight.  My wife and I had approached one of the two open bars with a minimal wait since most people were shuffling in at that time. We ordered our drinks and started walking around to get to know the environment.  No food that we could see or smell at that time though out the evening.  As the night progressed the club was packed as expected.  Unfortunately, this made waiting for a drink about 20 - 30 minutes.  Again the bars were way understaffed with little organization for crowd control.  At one of the bars they stated that they ran out of Jack Daniels early on. 

DJ was good and kept people dancing through out the night.  The crowd was friendly and respectful. The general admission crowd was left standing all night unless you could sneak into the VIP lounge area to grab a seat.  Absolutely no seats available for general admission which sucked.  At midnight the DJ missed the New Years Eve count down by 20 seconds (not a huge deal).  We left shortly after.

To say the least, we would not return due to lack of seating, no food or champagne as promised on the tickets, and bar time waits.

We eat at a hotel restaurant even its food is mediocre and everything is overpriced, because we expect to be treated really nicely by well trained staff.  Well, the experience at this hotel restaurant was very unique.  We (five of us) stayed at the Hotel Monaco to celebrate my birthday, and reserved Red Owl Tavern based on many good reviews.  When we arrived at the tavern, we were taken to a table for four.  We told the gentleman that we were a party of five and we had a reservation.  He told us that he would bring a chair.  So, one of us sat on a chair that was placed in an aisle.  We then saw the area in the back where a group of five or so just left.  So we asked if we could move there.  The waitress told us that those tables were reserved.  I told her that we too ""reserved"" a table for five not four, and it was my birthday.  She told me that she would ""see what she could do.""  Soon, a lady came to our table and said, ""Those tables are reserved.""  I told her that we had made a reservation for five.  She said, ""Sorry, this is only what we have"" and patted on my shoulder and left.  My husband was upset, but I said it was OK.  I decided not to let this ruin my birthday.  After that, however, few things went right. They brought pasta with cheese even though I asked the waitress no cheese due to my daughter's allergy.  So, my very hungry daughter had to wait another 20 minutes for her pasta with no cheese.  We had to ask why the bread, the side, and my father's dish were so late when other dishes were already at the table.  When the bread came after a long wait, it had butter on it despite the fact we told the waitress my daughter was allergic to dairy.  My 81 year old father's dish (Caesar salad with chicken) finally came after everyone finished their food which was more than an hour after we ordered all the food.  While all these things happening, we saw the area we had hoped to move in order to have more room which was ""reserved"" completely empty.  Toward the end of the meal, a couple of people were seated at one of the empty tables.  Our waitress was very apologetic.  She was never rude.  She took the pasta, Caesar salad, bread, off the bill, which was nice.  Would I like to dine at Red Owl Tavern again to deal with all the stress, especially for a special occasion like a birthday?

My boyfriend and I each ordered the 7 course tasting menu because why the hell not. The timing and portions of the meal culminated perfectly from 'ehhh not that full' to 'getting there' to 'just right.' I usually leave chef tasting menus feeling like I'm with child and lethargic, so to feel completely full and satisfied without discomfort was a wonderful treat. And they give you enough time to digest in between each dish, which is rare.  The meal did take up to two hours.

Overall, each dish (minus one) was executed flawlessly, was delicate and flavorful, made sense with every single spice and texture on the dish, and opened my mind to the variety of ways you can prepare a dish.

Favorites (in layman's terms): escargot in butter bowl, crab over snake-like pasta with red sauce, duck (or rabbit) thick pasta in white sauce, squid ink mystery appetizer thing, sea bass with celery decoration, apple cake with whiskey sauce and apple chips that looked like bananas but were, in fact, not. My fizzy sangria, though it was a little weak. And of course, the warm truffle oil bread that looks like a muffin, like holy crap, amiright?

Not digging: the ""surf and turf"" pork and octupus over heavily perfumey lentils/rice with too many peppercorns. And the worst of all (personal preference), the chicken liver mousse, served with papaya chunks and a peanut sauce. I actually had to switch that dish for the squid ink one. It was so unpalatable and the texture and taste felt wrong on so many levels. But if you're into carcass squeezed into a paste with a watery sauce then this is for you.

Decor is awesome. Diagon Alley exposed staggered brick in the bathroom, so that's cool.

Small kitchen in the front, music, and two party of 4 , with a very warm atmosphere.

I ordered the soup of the day, a hearty vegetable and rice soup and the lunch size kalamari . I received the soup first, with a side of hot fresh grilled pita. As I finished half of the plate, the waitress filled my plate up with even more! The soup was tasty, a flavor I never had in a soup. 

She then brought out the kalamari with dipping sauce. No seasoning to the kalamari itself, but was fresh and crispy with great dipping sauce.  Wrapped up the two additional pieces of pita for my walk through Benjamin Franklin Museum district for when hunger calls.

-HAPPY HOUR and LATE NIGHT:  Happy Hour is 5-7 weekdays, and gets you half-price margaritas ($2.50 is hard to beat).  Late night is Sunday-Thursday 10pm-12am, and gives you half-price margaritas AND draft beers (usually they have a few decent craft beers).

-$1 per person endless chips, smoked pico de gallo and salsa verde- DELICIOUS, and perfect happy hour/late night food

Drink lots of water, that's for sure- and don't let this deter you.

I appreciated the handmade tortilla and the fish hot out of the frier, but for the miniscule fish portion, they were just not worth $4 each. My boyfriend did not enjoy the flavoring of the taco of the month, though he noted that the shrimp was cooked very nicely. He really enjoyed the carne taco. However, two tacos and some chips for each of us, which came to a total of about $21 for lunch, felt like a scant meal and we had to snack a couple of hours later.",2018-02-12 15:13:20,"{'food': ['chips with salsa roja', 'fried fish tacos', 'taco of the month', 'carne taco'], 'drink': []}"

Unfortunately it was the worst I've ever tasted! I took 3 bites and had to throw it away, which infuriates me since I paid $12 for this just to be wasted. The noodles were way too over cooked and mushy. They were also super dry, I didn't taste any sauce at all. Way too much veggies, which were also dry.

I think the restaurant is moving to a chef's tasting menu-only option, and that is fine because that is the best way to experience the indulgence that is Marc Vetri's cooking. In conjunction with the wine pairing, this is a can't miss option. Been here a number of times now and have always left feeling as if the money paid was well worth it.

Everything is delicious. There's no point in telling you which dishes to order, because its a crapshoot what you'll get based on Vetri's mood and available ingredients for the evening. However, the wait staff will ask if you have dietary constraints and will take that information back to the kitchen. My wife will not eat seafood, and they worked around that for her.

A couple of things about the service: it is great. Hostesses, wait staff are uber-attentive and the sommelier is awesome! His name escapes me, but he is friendly, knowledgeable, and constantly available for all the dumb questions I wanted to ask about wine. He is a blast to chat with and adds to the total experience you get here. He makes me and my friends feel comfortable.

Last thing....the last time we were there, the staff recognized me and my friend and gave the ladies at our table that evening's tasting menu with Marc Vetri's autograph. That was a nice touch to end a special evening.

Can't say enough good things about Vetri...it is a place that you should go to at least once to say that you've had the experience. Chances are you'll go there again.",2011-07-04 17:33:20,"{'food': ['dishes'], 'drink': ['wine']}"

Tip: Do the 4 course tasting menu for $39.  If you buy an entree and one other item, it's already paid for itself, what a great deal!

There were 4 of us so we were able to try each others' dishes.  I ordered the shrimp in the shell and the presentation was great but it was hard to get the shrimp out of the shells and it tasted a bit fishy.  My friend ordered the octopus and I wish I had ordered that instead.  It was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of spices to give it some unique flavors but not too overpowering.  I also liked the lamb meatballs, which came with a yogurt sauce so these reminded me of a greek dish.
