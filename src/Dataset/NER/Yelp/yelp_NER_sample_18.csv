It has a reputation for offering ""Center City"" atmosphere, with ""Northeast Philly"" earthiness.  I guess that means you don't always have to run downtown to find a cool place to eat, or conversely, that Northeast Philly now has its own duck fat fries outlet.  Can I hear a, ""Hallelujah!""?

We stopped in for a late lunch after an appointment with Homeland Security on Drummond Road nearby.  That is never a sparkling experience, and we all wanted something to wash away the bureaucratic dust that comes with dealing with the Feds. We ordered three of their signature burgers, and the Salt & Pepper Fries for the table.  Water all around. We waited about 20 minutes for our meals to arrive, all the while smelling the grilling beef in the open kitchen.  This was a very hot day, and the HVAC was struggling to maintain the right comfort level.  Even with the front door closed, the humidity in the house was noticeable.  

The House Grind Burger, Pork Roll Burger and Beast of Northeast Burger arrived in the arms of our erstwhile server.  All looked great with Brioche-style rolls, and the individual toppings.  My Beast was a mix of Wild Boar and Beef, Smoked Gouda, Sweet Tomato Jam, Bacon and Crisp Sriracha Shoestring Onions.  Beautiful to behold.  First bite should have been awesome, but aside from the interesting flavor of the fixings, the ""Medium"" finish requested was in fact, ""Well Done.""  With the juice gone, I could not taste the difference in the meats, and found the burger less than hoped. The same was true for the House Grind, although for some reason the Pork Roll Burger came out ""Medium Rare,""  and amply juiced.  The S & P Fries were good; hot, but not crisp. 

It is always awkward to low rank a popular restaurant, but it was what it was.  Someone needs to pay more attention at the grill, as it is likely to have happened before.

We went on Memorial Day evening thinking the city would be empty and there would be a short wait. No such luck and at 8:00 the wait was 45 minutes. We decided to wait it out as it was a really nice night and we walked around. We were seated outside which was also OK as it was so pleasant, the inside is pretty small and there is not a lot of seating. 

I had the Village Burger. It was good but I wasn't blown away. Maybe I heard so much about the Village Whiskey that it was impossible to meet my expectations even if Jose Garces personally cooked my burger and served it to me.  I don't know, the bun was really good but a bit soggy when my plate arrived. The meat was pretty good also, cooked just right but it just didn't knock me out as anything super special. I added the Rogue Smokey Blue bringing my burger to close to $15.00.

My daughter had the Kentucky Hot Brown and that was excellent, better then the burger. The brioche was really tasty. My wife had the Cobb salad and that just pretty good. We had the the duck fat french fries and again they were just OK at best.

The Village Whiskey is expensive for comfort/bar food, especially if your party is ordering drinks.

This was my first time at either of the red king locations. I was there for a large dinner and we were seated at the largest table tucked away in the back of the restaurant. This location allows diners to observe the rest of the patrons, but it effectively makes you invisible to the staff unless they are delivering some food. 

The service was pretty poor, it took a good amount of time till we were able to get someone's attention for water. Normally this wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that this place specializes in spicy ass food. If the place was packed and under staffed then they may be excused, but it was neither.

We ordered a good amount of food, most spicy but some was not. The scallion pancakes were not too bad. The flavor was all in the dipping sauce, but I don't think the over fried slice even had scallions... maybe it was just pancakes, I don't recall. The spicy dumplings in some sort of soy sauce spice oil was surprisingly good. Good flavor with a kick, not simply tongue numbing red oil. There was some type of thick spicy glass noodle which made my tongue and mouth burn. There was minimal flavor and maximal peppers, I wasn't a fan. The non spice food was good.

I didn't think our food was bad but I also didn't think it was good. The staff there was very kind. I was impressed by how quickly our food was made, although it wasn't that busy. Mel's is a small establishment with limited seating. We got lucky that a table had just opened up when we arrived. (There's a parking lot next to the building, which is a huge plus!) I ordered the double down (eggs, choice of meat and French toast) with a side of toast. I don't indulge in buttered toast often so I was excited for my breakfast side, however upon being served my food, I was disappointed because the butter they used was unsalted. What's the point of putting butter on anything if it's unsalted? It had no taste and was smothered in butter so the toast quickly became soggy. The French toast was also smothered in butter and had very little cinnamon or powdered sugar. I grew up in New England and prefer real maple syrup so Mrs. Butterworth's is a sin to me, which is why I rely on the cinnamon and powdered sugar on my French toast. I requested more from my waitress and she put a dash more on, but not enough for my liking. I'd have rather been given a side of the cinnamon and sugar to control how much I wanted on my breakfast, but it wasn't worth asking again at this point. As you can tell, I'm on the pickier side, but my boyfriend enjoyed his veggie omelette.

     So luckily, it's only about 5 minutes from my apartment. My gf and I couldn't decide what to do for dinner so we gave the Grain Exchange a try. The whole menu was quite appealing, but we thought some small plates would be a good mix. We had sweet potato cakes, short rib poutine, chicken & dumplings, and roasted Brussels sprouts.
     I'm not a sweet potato fan, so these were for my gf. I think they were ok, something was missing in my opinion, but they were good enough. Personally my least favorite dish, but not bad by any means. I really liked the poutine, though my gf felt we've had better in other places. It was a very tasty dish. A nice mix of gravy soaked fries as well as some crispy ones. Short ribs was a good addition, though I didn't think it pushed it over the top. The chicken and dumplings was in competition for favorite dish with the Brussels sprouts. Chicken & dumplings was a good comfort dish. Not excessively seasoned, kind of ""plain"", but what you'd expect of the dish. Plain in a good way. The sprouts were the opposite flavor-wise. Slightly charred, bacon, onions, and a balsamic vinaigrette. Lots of flavor and textures.
     Oh, but I almost forgot. I saw a pic of the apple dumplings online and thought we should try dessert. OH MY! They were amazing.

My love for postmates continues to grow, as within 45 minutes, I had hot meal delivered to me from a place I've been meaning to try.

The good: 
My brisket noodle soup and dumplings in chili oil arrived hot. The broth was separate from its components such that the noodles were al dente and when combined together, were just right. The brisket was very good. The dumpling filling (pork) was fresh and better than most.

The bad:
The broth was very underwhelming. It was certainly salty and savory enough, however, just left a lot to be desired. Considering the broth brings the whole dish together, I really couldn't get through it. The matzo ball addition to the soup seems forced to me, or, I'm just not a matzo fan. The dumplings were cooked well and the filling, as mentioned, was well done, however, the chili oil it was in lacked flavor.

I was so proud to take my bf to my (FORMERLY) favorite restaurant restaurant for his retirement dinner (20+ years in the United States Airforce---stationed in ALASKA). We ran late for sunset, so we ate dinner somewhere else but STILL opted to come to R2L for drinks, light apz, and dessert after dinner. That was a MISTAKE. They ALMOST KILLED HIM AND GAVE US A CHECK FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

... Long story short, I was sitting next to him (at the bar) when he tapped me and motioned me to look at his mouth and the champagne glass he was drinking from. THE GLASS had BROKEN IN HIS MOUTH!!!! I was freaking out, but trying not to make a CRAZY scene. He spit out the glass and scurried off to the bathroom. I told the bartender, what happened and he started apologizing. A minute or so later (after consulting with some guy in the corner who looked important in a suit) the bartender asked me ""did he (my bf) bite down on the glass and break it?"" HUH? WTH? Who bites down on a glass and breaks it in their freaking MOUTH????? Have you ever drank out of a glass and broke it? What the hell  kind of question is that? At this point I'm  TOTALLY disgusted AND HUMILIATED. Was it being suggested by him or the ""important corner guy"" that bf PURPOSEFULLY broke a damn glass in his own mouth? Are you FREAKING kidding me???
About 5 mins later my bf returned and said he thought he was ok and got all of the glass and HOPED he hadn't swallowed any.  Finally, ""Important corner guy"" came over asked if he was okay. I had a funny feeling what was to follow. Yup...You guessed it...THE FREAKING CHECK!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DISGUSTED by the fact that these people had the NERVE to #1 SUGGEST that the glass was broken on purpose (or even ask that stupid a$$ question) and #2 to give me a FREAKING CHECK for it? Granted they were ""kind"" enough to take off the ""Broken GLASS"" drink, but the other drink, dessert, and appetizer was STILL on the check. I was absolutely SEETHING MAD. I wanted to flip out, but I was ACTUALLY wayyyyy TOO HURT by the treatment of this seemingly classy establishment. It totally sucked. My bf was pissed and wanted to go, before he got upset by the check-gate incident.
 I was treating for the night because it was part of our celebration of his service and THIS was the way the night out ended? I am so ashamed that I have suggested this restaurant to sooo many people and was equally excited to share this ""rare gem"" with my bf. I could go on and on about what should have happened, BUT at the end of the day IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE DON'T MATTER. OUR PATRONAGE DOESN'T/DIDN'T MATTER. AND YOURS MAY NOT EITHER. 

If I can keep one person from going to this snooty, stuck up, MONEY HUNGRY establishment I will be fine with that. I am going to contact the owner (luckily I have some inside info) and certainly make a big fuss. If you are on the fence about going---DON'T. This place totally let me down, but MORE importantly they just don't give a d*amn about their customers. At least some of their customers. I guess there are those who count and those who don't. I won't say anymore because it's not even worth getting into. 

R2L you officially are THE WORST. I will make it my mission to let everyone know AND I GOT A BIGGGGGG MOUTH! Shame on you! SMH

The current owner (Joe Groh) is not the grandson of the original owner (Sam ""Chink"" Sherman).  Joe used to work for Sam back in the day and eventually bought the place from him.

I'm 35 and didn't hear of Chink's until I was 25. My ex-girlfriend's dad introduced me to the best cheesesteak in Philly. My relationship with her may have gone south, but my relationship with Chink's has been a sweet romance with nothing but love. 
I became a regular in there. All the girls knew me (they are ALL good looking) and soon the owner, Joe, got to know me.  He got to know me so well, in fact, that he invited me to the Super Bowl party at his house when the Eagles were in it.  That was a sweet memory. 
That's the benefit of a small business: they know you and you know them. 
All that being said, Chink's is by far THE best place to have a cheesesteak. Located in a working class neighborhood, this is a far cry from a touristy joint. This is where the locals go. It's our secret. The cheesesteaks are great. The chocolate-banana shakes are great. What really makes this place the BEST, though, is the ambiance. The narrow booths. The old swivel stools at the counter. The jukebox. The ""made in front of you"" fountain sodas. Most important: the ""made in front of you AND passers by"" cheesesteaks. The steaks are literally made on a grill in the front window. No secrets here.
This place doesn't ""feel"" like an old malt shop. It IS an old malt shop. Sherman opened it in 1949. That's right, Chink's is 59 years old. How many restaurants can say that? 
All in all, if you want to relax after a hard day at work and enjoy some comfort food, Chink's is the place to be.

Ordered three rolls and they were awful.  The spicy tuna and the unagi rolls contained this weird mixture, which I assume was pureed fish.  I've never experienced that before.  The salmon rolls had too much rice and the seaweed was too thick.  We slathered the rolls in soy sauce and wasabi to make them more palatable. 

Ordered three pieces of sushi.  They were some of the largest pieces of sushi I've ever had. The salmon was not fresh.  The hamachi was boring.  The striped bass, which was the cheapest of the sushis, was actually the most flavorful. 

A crisp Riesling is usually a good accompaniment to sushi.  Unfortunately, there is not one on the menu.  The one they had was cloyingly sweet, with no acid or fruit.  It wasn't even finished!  The pinot noir was too earthy.  The cava, while not great, was the best of the options.

Once upon a time, in a land called 1960, conveniently located just off the interstate, there was a Holiday Inn.  Beneath the conspicuous flashing starburst and the green and yellow display of neon and tidy, slanted script, there was a drive-thru portico sheltering various two-toned, two-tonned hunks of Detroit steel with elaborate fins and chrome trim.  Inside, across the lobby from the front desk, beyond the Danish modern seating area, was the entrance to the restaurant and lounge.  

Jones IS the restaurant and lounge at the Holiday Inn of 1960.

It is refreshing for the weary wanderer to dine at Jones - a wonderland of flagcrete (formed into columns, planters, a bar, and a fireplace), vegetation, cozy booths, cradling chairs, soothing air conditioning, and vibrant yet restrained colors that won't tire your eyes.  The two times I have visited Jones, it was to briefly escape some unpleasant reality.  (Much like the people at the Holiday Inn in 1960, I imagine.)  I succeeded both times.

From other reviews on Yelp, it is clear that the food isn't quite pretentious enough for a lot of the people who visit this establishment.  FLASH: If you're going to Jones expecting haute cuisine, you are going to completely miss the point of this restaurant, and you would do well to explore other eateries.

For everybody else, the food is reliable, hearty, and plentiful, as it is in your mother's kitchen.  After a day of desired and undesired new sights and sounds, sometimes you simply want something familiar, even if it is only a meal.  For entrees, I can personally recommend the fried chicken basket.  The Thankgiving dinner is also delicious.  My dinner companion enjoys the meatloaf at Jones, and, on our latest escape, was presented with an extremely generous Cobb salad.  You will not leave hungry, and even if it's not the best food you've ever had, it probably won't be the worst, and it will certainly take you back to someplace pleasant that you know and love.  Thoughts of your home... away from home.

Our waitress was extremely attentive and pleasant.  The music is decidedly not of the Holiday Inn 1960, but was very bearably modern.  I actually heard a couple favorites (Nada Surf's ""Blonde On Blonde,"" Rogue Wave's ""Lake Michigan,"" etc.).

This place is an ideal spot for a date or small group of friends. There were so many different, unique flavors presented on their short but encompassing menu, and with incredible suggestions from our server we ordered a feast - Spanish Octopus, Lamb Meatballs, Roasted Carrots & Burrata, Big Eye Tuna, and Swordfish. This was the absolute best culinary decision I've made in a while. Instead of coming out all at once, the plates were perfectly timed so we were able to take our time to enjoy flavors and conversation in between. Everything was spectacular. I'd never had octopus, and I was keen to try it. It was very tasty and a better texture than I anticipated. It is daunting to see a giant charred tentacle plated in front of you, but I was able to look past it after my first bite. 
Everything was excellent, but my two favorite dishes (I can't pick just one!!!) were the burrata and the swordfish. The burrata and carrots was rich but light, flavorful in all the right ways. The swordfish was juicy, buttery, and cooked to absolute perfection served with snap peas that looked and tasted like they were freshly picked. 

The live music, the warm breeze and outdoor seating, and the incredible service of the wait staff made for an incredible evening. To top the cherry, I got 15% off of our food bill thanks to simply checking-in on yelp! My friends and I polished five incredible plates of quality food for $60 - split three ways for $20 apiece. Honestly, it feels like robbery.

We ordered three appetizers such as the roti canai or Indian pancake with a side of chicken curry sauce. The roti is a large, very thin flat bread. It was soft and warm. The roti was accompanied with a small bowl of curry sauce with a chunk of chicken for dipping. It was very delicious and is the among their most ordered appetizer. The second appetizer was the satay chicken and beef skewers. You have the option of all beef, all chicken, or a mix, we chose the mix which is 6 skewers (3 chicken and 3 beef) with a side of peanut sauce. The meat was grilled to perfection and very flavorful. The sauce had nice tangy taste and the peanut wasn't overwhelming and went very well with the grilled meats.

Our waitress was very nice and offered suggestion the whole way. My friend and I were very curious of the friend pig intestines, but our waitress quickly killed our curiosity by saying that she didn't recommend it. We pressed for a better answer and she mentioned the smell. I am no stranger to pig intestines and have always known them as chitterlings or ""chitlins"" in Soul Food, so I am all to familiar with that strong pork, barnyard smell. Admittedly, I avoided ""chitlins""when I was younger. She was persistent in steering us away, so we left it alone.


However, as we waited for our entrees, we kept thinking about the pig intestine. We decided to order it. Our waitress tried to dissuade us from ordering, but we, especially I, was curious to try ""chitlins"" prepared a different way. She basically said that she was washing her hands clean of the situation. In case we didn't like them, a refund wasn't optional, she said. I understand the warnings for some, but it's just pork. This isn't fear factor and pig intestines are enjoyed by many cultures around the world. The intestines weren't bad, though. They were nicely fried, with a nice even outer crisp. The best and preferred parts were the very crispy ends. The inner texture is what made it a bit unbearable and I could never get used to it which is why the crispier parts were better. The fried scallion stuffed inside some pieces wasn't enjoyable, at all. A sweet sauce sprinkled with sesame seeds was served for dipping. Also, that pork barnyard smell that our waitress spoke about was nearly non-existent. I guess frying the intestines masks the smell, but stewing them in a pot does exacerbate it.

Our choice in entrees vastly differed. My friend ordered the Prawn Mee, a noodle soup with a broth made from prawn shells. The egg noodles were very thick. The broth had a certain thickness and very ""fishy"" taste, in other words, the taste of the prawn was very strong. The soup also had slices of pork and shrimp. My friend really enjoyed it, but I wasn't a big fan. I ordered the beef rendang which consisted of tender cuts of beef stewed in a curry/turmeric based sauce. The beef was amazingly tender and succulent. It was served with a side of rice.

Our only gripe with the meal is that entree portions were small. However, I will be returning. The food was delicious, the restaurant's decor and ambience is great for a nice dinner out in the city.

What I like most is that the Khyber Pass scores high marks in every category. Creativity, Quality, Service and Cleanliness.

I have frequented Khyber Pass for over twenty years. I actually used to play here as a musician. While they currently do not offer live music, that should not stop you from going here. Although they do play some great recorded music.

Lets get the easy stuff out of the way. Service is excellent. A very knowledgable staff that is friendly and attentive. Next is cleanliness. For an old property, they do a nice job of keeping it up. Even the bathrooms are clean on the busiest of nights. Then quality. Hands down fresh. They have a great beer selection (mostly micro-brew with some of the usual big names), and a nice Scotch selection as well. Unusual in the area.

But the best is the food. The Khyber Pass sits on 3rd Street with dozens of other restaurants next door and close by. And out of all of them, even so called four star restaurants (or so they tell themselves), this place would be my first choice.

So a few food recommendations. The fried green tomato BLT is awesome. Even more so is the duck, cashew peanut butter and pepper jelly sandwich. Just amazing. I get it every time I go there. Last is the mac and cheese and collard greens. Both authentic homestyle. So just a few standouts, but the whole menu (which is small, a plus if you read my reviews) is superb and well executed.

If you're in the area, just go here. The Khyber Pass will please any palette with service to match.

We planned to attend another establishment nearby but the wait was almost 30 minutes so we decided to give Lloyd a chance. Staff was friendly and amenable at first. However, It took about 10 to 15 minutes for our first round of drinks to arrive. And then we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally after waiting for our food for about 45 minutes, the waiter appeared and we asked him if you could check with the kitchen. He also took our second round drink order at that time. It took another 10 minutes for those drinks to arrive at which point the waiter informed us that that round was on him because our food was taking so long. We had ordered five entrées: the regular breakfast, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, the French toast and vegan scrapple. The food finally arrived and three plates showed up, assuming at the other two plates were on the next visit we just accepted those three. About five minutes later the waiter appeared again and we asked him where the other two entrées were. He looked at us with a puzzled look, and we told him we were still missing the vegan scrapple and the sausage and biscuits. About 10 minutes after that he showed up with foie gras scrapple, I told him that I don't eat foie gras because I'm a vegan. He apologized and went back into the kitchen, and the wait began again. We had an infant with us, who was starting to get fussy because we have now been there for an hour and 15 to an hour and half. So eventually I went into the kitchen and asked him to please cancel the other two items that had not shown up yet and to just bring us our check. So to make a long story short, our first visit to Lloyd was not a very positive one, and I'm not sure we'll ever go back and give them another chance. The food we did eat was okay, not exceptional, but acceptable. But I think sometimes the longer you have to wait, and the hungrier you get, the more critical you may become.

There is some room for improvement, but it was a great meal (the bar is pretty awesome as well).  We were lucky enough to be there during restaurant week, so we were able to try a 4 course meal for a reduced price.  

Charcoal grill (small plates): The octopus was very good, cooked and seasoned well.  I am not the biggest fan of fennel, but it tasted great with the grilled seafood.  The grilled clams were not as good.  The big problem for me was the chorizo.  I LOVE chorizo, but here is was overpowering the clams, and was way too greasy for this type of dish.  I think the clams would have benefited from some simplicity the way the octopus did.    During this course, they also gave us popcorn seasoned with rosemary bacon drippings, this is terrific, and worth coming for on it's own.  

Appetizers: The pulled pork and cheddar empanadas were very tasty and would be great to pick on with drinks.  I have had too many empanadas where the insides were dried out and am happy to report that this is not the case here.  I have seen on yelp a lot of people raving about the crawfish mac and cheese.  I have to disagree, it was nowhere near cheesy or spiced enough.  What should be a rich comfort food was bland and forgettable.  

Entrees: First of all, I was super excited to try the shrimp and grits here, but they were sold out for the day.  We ordered the duck breast and the pork chop.  Both were pretty good.  While duck holds a special place in my heart, I think the pork chop was actually better, the herbs and sweet potatoes were a terrific match.  The duck was tasty.  It did not have a crunchy crust to it, which I missed, but was otherwise well cooked.  The figs with the duck were a nice touch.

Dessert: The beignets were okay, they were served with cinnamon and sugar rather than powdered sugar as I expected them to be.  The way that a warm beignet almost melts the powdered sugar is the best part about the dessert. I thought the blood orange panna cotta was pretty terrific, definitely choose this as your dessert.

Drinks: The Southern Wine Cooler is basically sangria with bourbon in it.  They are refreshing and pack a punch.  We tried a couple of their other whiskey drinks, but this was the big highlight.

Especially when meat eating is ingrained in my DNA, along with years of learned habit.  I love eating meat.  There's no way around it.  I'm not full after a carby snack, leafy greens are good but leave me craving, and the only way to satisfy my hunger a full belly is meat.

Consider my mind change.  I knew little of soy proteins going into my HipCityVeg experience.  And I still know little about soy proteins, however I came away with two things: they taste like meat, and they are damn delicious.  Their ""Chick'n"" tastes like chicken (you know the delicious bird that lays delicious eggs and taste great grilled, fried, or oven roasted?).  Same goes for about everything on the menu.  I tried the wrap and the fried chick'n sandwich on my first visit.  The chick'n ranch was nearly mistaken for a Chik-fil-a order with too much sauce, but in a good way.  (I hope no ranches were harmed in making the sauce).  The wrap is what keeps me coming back.  It's bursting with flavor from peppers, fake chicken/soy/whatchamajig, beans, carrots and other vegis that hit the pallet in all the right ways.

I have to admit.  I've bad talked vegans and animal lovers before, but HipCity has me eating my words.  Meat lovers are quick to follow their HipCityVeg meals with a nice order of foot-in-mouth.  This is the place to keep the peace between meat-a-tarians, vegetarians, and anyone in between.",2012-07-11 21:56:22,

After a short wait because I did not have a reservation, and seeing multiple possible customers leave instead of waiting, my son and I were seated.  The place was full of customers, noisy, and the kitchen was busy.

The chef was able to accommodate my son's request for a plain burger with ketchup.  He was charged full-price for their house burger from the regular weekday menu. I had the pork roll burger.  We also ordered the duck fat fries.

After what I thought was an unusually long wait, my son's burger came out with the fries.  They are covered in cheese, but not that fake whiz that some places use.  This was very good.  I wish that the cheese came on the side so I can control how much is put on which was too much on this one for me.  Also, there was not enough duck meat in the rather large platter of fries.  After about 4-5 forks of fries with duck, the duck was gone leaving over 3/4 of the dish with no duck left.  My son enjoyed his decent sized plain burger with his ketchup and finished it.  Then another considerably long wait occurred before I ended up getting my pork roll burger.  I had believed that they forgot about my order until the waitress came and said it was coming up.

My burger also huge was quite tasty and sloppy with the runny egg coming down the sides after I squished it with the potato roll.  I saw other people's orders including the chicken and waffles which looked and smelled really good, and the wings which had much different sauce flavors to try on the menu that you usually don't see.  The table next to us went through those very quickly.  Also saw the egg roll appetizer which looked homemade.

Overall, I have to try Blue Duck again on a weekday or Saturday to get a better feel of what this restaurant is all about.  The menu choices were more interesting.  Nothing super special today but my son and I did like what we had.

When our waiter brought the first course, I thought it was an amuse bouche - a tiny goblet of celery custard with small pieces of lobster - it turned out to be the first course.  Small but fine.  

My friend insisted on getting the foie gras soup - it tasted true to its name, a rich broth whose main flavor was goose liver.  I actually preferred the intense spinach soup, a richly tasting emerald broth that looked and tasted great.  

Next came the highlight of the evening:  an expertly cooked piece of sea bass on a bed of home-made orecchiette.  The pasta was superbly prepared, I would love it as a separate course.  The small piece of ""Kobe"" beef (Wagyu beef) of the next course was cooked just right (medium rare), the sides forgettable.  The ubiquitous Wagyu beef (in the US, mostly a cross-bred Angus) has about as much in common with the deservedly famous Japanese Black as a strip-mall tuna roll with Tsukiji bluefin.  Still, a rich tasting little morsel to please any carnivore.

The last two courses, a small cheese plate with two local cheeses, served with toasted nut-raisin bread (Metropolitan?) and a raspberry tartlet with a good raspberry sorbet made for a fine if unspectacular finish.  

I enjoyed the wine selection that came with the tasting menu but some of the wines served to us came from the very bottom rest of the bottle and this did affect the quality of the wines (I don't know how long the bottle was open but in the case of the White Bordeaux dessert wine, it was too long).  Also, our waiter uses the word ""Sauternes"" a lot when the dessert wine was clearly not a Sauternes.  Just how much better the wines could taste from a freshly opened bottle became clear when we tasted the final wine - a sprightly recioto from the Veneto - twice:  once in its dulled end-of-the-bottle form, the other time in its lively freshly openend version.   If you have the nerve, it might be a good idea not to accept too many wines that have been opened a long while ago.

Well, considering my boyfriend and I live around the corner from Dmitri's, and it is frequently a busy restaurant so we assumed it must be good, we gave it a third shot.  It was a rainy Thursday evening so we were promptly taken to be seated elbow to elbow with another table of two.  Considering there were other tables available, I requested a different table in which I waitress politely said she'd prepare.  When we were seated we received our water, had our bottle o' red uncorked and unpoured into small rimmed glasses that only allow you to take the smallest sips(I feel sorry for those with BIG noses!) and were verbally given the specials.  My boyfriend is hearing impaired, so he did need them to repeated, and considering it's such a loud atmosphere, they should offer the specials on paper.  Soon after we were brought some warm, grilled pita bread, which would have been tasty if it wasn't burnt on the grill, accompanied with a low quality olive oil, red wine vinegar and some herb which did nothing for the tasteless dip.  There was also some bread in the basket so I asked if they had butter, and they said they had no butter.  Okay, fine.  We ordered our appetizers, shrimp scampi and steamed mussels.  The shrimp was very fresh, yet the dish very salty.  The mussels were served in a SOUP of bland garlic broth, topped with giant slices of tomato, spinach, green pepper and onion.  Interesting to say the least.  I thought maybe music could tone down the loud atmosphere, and when I requested some be put on, I was told there was music on but the noise inside exceeded it.  There wasn't any on though because we were seated below a speaker, and would have heard atleast a faint sound at any more silent moments.  Finally we get our entrees, Fried Flounder and a Mediterranean whole white fish, which came filleted as a requested, both served with sauteed spinach and yellow rice.  The flounder was very fresh, but like our other dishes, bland.  However, my white fish was incredible.  A very rich, savory, melt-in-your-mouth goodness.

D8ogthWHM-_OuGjVwoGiSg,DgpHITohyaGvTkvWwonBtw,htO_nlxkEsYHzDrtbiUxew,2,8,9,5,"Okay, so this place is essentially a mainstay in Rittenhouse square. I almost feel like I don't need to review La Colombe, as everyone is aware of its existence.  I used to go to La Colombe often, before I saw the light of what actual quality coffee tasted like.  So I have this complex opinion about La Colombe, but I think I've kind of seen the light for what it is. 

First off, yes it's inexpensive relatively for okay coffee. But you're trading off the fact that you're not getting great coffee. The coffee itself is nothing to write home about. I'd go without it.  The espresso is good, I usually get a double macchiato or a cappuccino when I go there. I'd say that the place is fairly mechanical, and it will give you the same thing on a consistent basis.

Speaking of consistency, you will always find yourself with a long line and seating is at a premium. You'll find a lot of couples who will be ravenous in the line, send one person to get a seat, while the other waits in line. This is the name of the game, as no one is really respectful enough to wait in line together.  There's a tendency for there to be loud children with their parents, thrashing their strollers back and forth, trying to, simultaneously, annoy the shit out of you by making an obstacle course, quiet their crying child via carelessly rocking the baby without any regard to the actual problem, and keep talking about that new Dior bag that Veronica just could not live without that they just think is trite.

There's a tendency for haughty privileged middle-aged couple to boast about their 401k's loudly in front of you in hope of you hearing how successful their meaningless life is.  If you can't tell, I don't really like the fanbase that La Colombe has.  Let me put it this way:  I'm surprised I haven't seen Mary Kate Olsen talking about her Vera Wang snuggie in this joint.  I've never gotten through an hour at La Colombe without the need of rolling my eyes at some absurdity like this.

I'm always amused that these people that are enthralled by expensive things go to a place where the coffee is mediocre, and could be better somewhere else by just adding a couple of quarters to the price.  I think La Colombe has a certain reputation of being amazing in Philly. I don't understand it though.

It's almost mechanical, where people expect the same cup every day when they go here, and they will get it here. The blend never changes, from what I can tell, and there's nothing truly exciting about La Colombe.  I like their carbonated water machine and almond croissant. That's about as excited as I get about this place.

In summary: If you're a douchebag that's spent all but two of their dollars on a new Michael Kors bag, and you need to go to a place to be around like minded douchebags to display your newly acquired display of ""wealth,"" get a coffee here, and put a bunch of sugar substitute and skim milk in it.

First time we went for my fiancess' birthday and everything was just majorly over priced for the quality (We go out to eat alot and we both have no problem spending alot of money on something that is really good!) I ordered my filet med rare and it came out almost well done. My lobster tail was freezing cold and so was my oscar on top of the filet.  Our server never checked up on us till my fiancee was done eating.  He felt awful but there was no way I was going to let his birthday dinner get cold.  Then the dessert never came out and the check was placed. We were very upset and no one really seemed to care. The manager apologized but nothing was taken off the check or nothing was done for us (I used to work in the industry and I dont expect anything for free or ever want anything for free but come on! I did not get to eat my dinner till way later and the surprise birthday dessert that I told the server about earlier never came!) Just very dissapointed and shocking.

The second time, two of my friends wanted to take us out to dinner and they picked Ruth Chris is Center City, Philadelphia.  I was not going to complain because thats what they wanted and it was their treat.  This experience was better. We got seated right away, the server was AMAZING as well. Very prompt, attentive, and caring to our wants and needs.  The food again though was just alright.  My steak was cooked perfectly but just okay.

This place is literally the best, most authentic korean food I've had thus far in philadelphia. They offer only a limited menu of bibimbap (with various proteins), pajeon (scallion pancake), and yuk gae jang (beef stew), but they do it right! I think it's advertised as a take-out joint, but the actual restaurant is a hole in a wall spot on south st that seats about 8-10 people, max. I saw the glowing reviews and though skeptical, decided to bike down here with a friend for dinner and was not disappointed. The pajeon was smaller than I imagined, but delicious and surprisingly filling - certainly enough to hold you over until the main dish. I love traditional bibimbap, and BAP does it SO SO well. I always get the classic marinated beef as my protein, and this particular version comes with soybean, carrots, cucumbers, mushroom, cabbage, a gooey egg, and broccoli! I would HIGHLY recommend paying the extra dollar for the dolsot option to get that crunchy rice on the bottom for more flavor!

Alright, alright, I'm being dramatic but the first impression is that this place is a little sketchy. You have to knock on the door and are addressed in the doorway rather than your typical restaurant of walking in and chatting it up with the host/hostess. Thankfully my friend had a reservation for us so we were standing outside for only a couple of minutes before they sat us in an intimate booth. Almost positive if you do not have a reservation, you will be standing in the cold alleyway for a long time. 

When you sit down the waiter washes your hands in rosewater, drapes your lap in a towel and promptly opens up your BYO drinks. As soon as your first glass of wine is poured, you have the first course of many in the center of the table and it's time to dig in. My first warning, if you do not like sharing food with others, you may want to reconsider this place for dinner. I'm pretty sure I indirectly swapped spit with my friends since I was licking my fingers and then grabbing for more food. Sorry friends!

The first course was a plate of eggplant that was to-die-for and a cucumber/tomato salad. The waiters are constantly walking around with more pita so you never feel like you are out of  carbs. The second course and beyond were slightly a blur since I was already in a food coma but I'll share what I can remember...there was a plate of couscous salad with raisins that was yummy, a whole chicken that was made ""spicy"" as well as a plate of lamb pieces. The food was beyond delicious though the meat was a tad dry but I still ate my face off. The only weird thing was before the baklava was served, the table was given a bowl of fruit. My only recommendation would be to have a fruit salad and maybe  1/2 the portion for people to enjoy rather than eating an entire apple...seems a little wasteful.

When you walk in you can hear New Orleans music  in the air, I immediately felt like I was in New Orleans. The restaurant is decorated according to theme and the ambience is very relaxed which is very nice. In review of the menu there were a lot of options to choose from that includes starters and entrees. We chose the gumbo. The ingredients made your mouth water and yes we were hungry. The gumbo came with a side of potato salad and a side of bread. We started our meal with small muffin shaped cornbread. It wasn't what I am generally use to;but,it was good and it had the texture of a cupcake. 

Moving on we had the potato salad, I really enjoyed it and didn't miss the boiled egg that usually accompanies this dish. The spicy bite of the salad was very unexpected but it was a pleasant surprise. Finally, we were prepared to dive into the gumbo. The gumbo was quit dark but I went in with a open mind. With the first bite we both noticed the scorched flavor of the entree. The chicken and the andouille was over cooked. Being a novice cook myself I immediately notice the meat and how I couldn't taste the flavor of the sausage at all. The chicken was mush. We explained to our waitress that the gumbo was over cooked. She stated that she would discuss with the chef. She then shared that the roux is darker and that may be the flavor we are tasting. Ok.

My mother and I then questioned if the roux would taste like smoke or scorched. My mother has been to New Orleans before and she stated that this gumbo is not from New Orleans. I've tasted gumbo before and have made it for my family numerous times and I was very disappointed in my meal. We didn't eat it. My mother ordered shrimp on her gumbo so we picked the shrimp off of her plate to have something. 

Ahhh dessert,my mother ordered the baguettes as she remember enjoying them last year in New Orleans. I must say, they were delicious ! 

Suggestions: change the gumbo recipe, offer other options for customers to choose another entree, assure that staff is sharing the specials for the night(we overheard another waitress sharing the specials and had to ask our waitress for details) honestly I would have ordered the special if we were offered another option. Brown rice should also be an option. Our cups should be periodically filled with water we only received one glass no refill. 

Also, we paid for our meal even though we did not have a meal we sent it back. We had drinks, cornbread, a few shrimp shared from my mother's plate and baguettes . A customer should not have to pay for a meal they didn't eat. Our meal was over cooked, scorched and we just didn't like it. We didn't eat it because we didn't want to get sick from eating burnt food. We didn't agitate, but wondered why we had to pay, our concerns.....ignored. We paid our bill and we also provided a tip and now please take this tip and adjust the service at Acadia. We originally came because my mother saw your restaurant featured on FYI Philly.

We were then asked if we had a reservation (who knew they even took reservations at a little place like this?).  Since we didn't, we were not offered the two tables that were clearly empty but instead ushered to the very last two seats at the counter.  Our waitress was pleasant and informed us of the specials which both my mother and I chose.  I had the chorizo tacos and she the mahi.  We switched halfway through our meal so that the other could taste.  The tacos were over done and quite frankly just tasted like regular hamburger meat.

Its original location in Northern Liberties is lauded as one of the best brunch places in Philly, and both the Southern and Jewish cultures it derives its cooking from adamantly claim to have the best food in the world. Now located on a corner at the very top of South Street, the second Honey's plays with this culinary tension to mixed results.

The decor takes inspiration from its Southern ancestry, a wide-open wood floor that, emptied of all its general store-chic knick-knacks and charmingly obsolete furniture pieces, could easily house a hoedown. However, the interior signals a big problem with Honey's menu in both locations: the food never seems to combine its Jewish and Southern roots. It's a struggle to find a unique mix of the two on its fairly expansive menu. In addition, Honey's seems to equate Southern cooking with eggs; it's in the egg-based dishes that you'll find the most interesting cross sections of cooking. Whether combining styles was the objective or not, it's a lost opportunity to stand out in a city already teeming with excellent brunch hotspots.

That being said, Honey's knows its flavor. The garlic pesto goat cheese burger ($12) was a delicious, if flawed, collision of thick, perfectly cooked beef and warm, melting goat cheese. The latter completely overwhelmed the burger's many other ingredients--the pesto spread, panko bread crumbs and a whole egg were completely lost in the battle--but the combination of meat and cheese was enough on its own. The potato latkes ($2.50) were also a standout, the unorthodox ribboncut potatoes so robust and smooth that one bite seemed to fill every crevice of your mouth. Finally, the deep-fried chocolate chip cookie ($5), topped with vanilla ice cream, was just as good as it sounds. Real good.

Unfortunately, the rest of the food was plagued by textural inconsistencies. The pumpkin pancakes, which had just the right mix of pumpkin, brightened by the occasional apple slice, were either softened by moisture or undercooked--either way, an execution mistake that added an unwanted density to the meal. Additionally, the fried green tomatoes ($6.25), breaded with enough kick to make its side of ranch a necessity, lacked the satisfying crunch that a crisp outer layer should provide. This sort of problem went all the way down to the apple sauce that came with the latke, its strange heaviness detracting from otherwise pitch perfect taste.",2015-02-27 16:24:54,"{'food': ['eggs', 'pesto goat cheese burger', 'potato latkes', 'fried green tomatoes', 'apple sauce'], 'drink': []}"

Last week, I called to make a reservation for my mother's birthday; I spoke with a woman and settled on a date and time, spelling my name for her and giving her my phone number. Fast forward to the day of the reservation; we needed to add a chair to the table. I tried calling for a couple of hours, but was greeted by a constant busy signal. So I asked one of the members of our dinner party, who lives doors away from the restaurant, to stop by and speak with someone. Upon my proxy's arrival, we learned that the restaurant had no record of the reservation, not for that night or for any night. One staff member was properly apologetic; one staff member, however, implied we were in the wrong: Apparently, it's suspicious to send someone in person to adjust a reservation, even when the phone line had been occupied, or unserviceable, all day. Furthermore, it's unforgivable to incorrectly remember which day I had called to make the reservation (though I had admitted I wasn't certain and would need to look at my phone records to say for sure). When I said ""I think it was day X [that I called to make a reservation],"" my proxy (whom I was on the phone with, and who was more patient than I would have been in a similar situation) was rebuffed, being told it was impossible I'd made a reservation that day as no one had been in the restaurant until late afternoon/evening. (For the record--not that I should ever have had to do this--I have since checked my call history and realized I'd called a day earlier than I'd suggested.) While it's true I did misspeak, I didn't lie about making the reservation--and I certainly did not appreciate the implication. All they could offer was a 10 p.m. seating (which my mother, understandably, was not interested in), or to call if there was an opening (which we knew, correctly, would not happen).

We didn't let this ruin our night, and we had a nice birthday celebration elsewhere. I know these things happen (though they really shouldn't), and an apology or similar gesture would have gone a long way.

Given that I normally go out in either New York or Jersey City, I didn't think anything of the fact that we didn't have a reservation.

We looked quite dejected, and the manager offered to serve us only 3 or 4 courses as a compromise, which we happily accepted.

Once we got inside, I understood the reservation requirement.  This isn't the kind of place where they can just move people around and add tables.  It is comprised of little nooks heaped with pillows around silver platters.  I was immediately hooked on the atmosphere.

The towel placed on your lap is an early indication that you are going to get quite messy.  No need to stand on ceremony here!  It puts you at ease to know that not only will you make a mess, but so will everyone else.

The chicken was very moist, and coated in a spicy sauce/rub.  We very nearly picked it clean.  The lamb was also excellent, but it largely went uneaten due to the volume of food that we had already consumed.  In all, we were served the full set of courses!  Such a treat.

We thanked the manager profusely on our way out for making room for us.  He gave us a bottle of wine as ""something to remember us by.""  I've heard of matches as mementos, but a bottle of wine?!

Came here on Wednesday night with a group of friends to play trivia. We arrived at 8pm, thinking we were smart early birds. However, we soon learned that our complacency was ill-advised. A waitress informed us that avid trivia-players typically show up around 6:30 to claim tables, but that we could stand a round a high-top if we so desired. We figured that was better than nothing (and it was really really cold), so we stayed put. As it turned out, we were able to hoard a few stools and put together a nice little setup for ourselves. Soon after, we realized that the place had filled up considerably, so our timing wasn't as bad as we initially thought. So my advice is definitely to show up early, 8 at the VERY latest, if you want to sit comfortably while trivia-ing. 

The space itself is pretty standard for a pub. A good number of tables in back, three or four high-tops in front, and a handful of seats at the bar. It can get a bit tight at times, but the servers do a good job of keeping everything relatively contained. 

Can't speak much to the food here, as we just got a couple things to munch on--fries and the Mediterranean platter. Both were fine. I wasn't expecting to be wowed by either--that's pretty much as standard as it gets. Hummus? Good. Fries? Good. Can't complain. 

The drinks were a different story, though. The two specials were enough to impress me, though one was just a crappy light beer. So crappy, in fact, that it tasted like soda (it's Bud Light Lime, for anyone desperate to know). But for three bucks, I'll take it. As I mentioned, the chocolate stout was superb. Rich and flavorful, and again, only $3! Plenty of places would charge two or three times that amount. So I was very pleased with this.

Finally, I must mention the trivia. Props to whomever comes up with these questions, because they were really damn difficult. There were a few throw-aways (i.e. Alan Rickman was the answer to a Diehard question), but most of the stuff was impossible. Quite humbling, really. The music round was ""90s grunge"", which is possibly the most difficult genre other than jazz/classical to identify, if you've never been a fan of that music. I think I got the Pearl Jam and Nirvana songs right, but I was otherwise useless. Still, a good time was had by all. Would definitely recommend!",2016-01-22 20:15:27,

Once we were seated, it took another 15 minutes or so for our waiter even acknowledge us.  I noticed he had a black eye and as our stay progressed, I couldn't help but think he got whilst at work.  He dropped off some water and said he'd be right back.  My friend said, 'I have a quick question for you...'   the waiter cut him off mid-sentence and replied 'You'll have to wait, I'll be back'.  It was then we considered leaving.  (By the way, the quick question was if root beer on tap was alcoholic or not.)  Instead, we waited a good ten more minutes for our waiter to return, while watching him cheerily chit-chat with a table outside.  The rest of our service was just as horrible.  After our initial round of drinks, we couldn't get anyone to stop by long enough to order more.

The only reason they got two stars is because the food was still decent and a waitress in training noticed we were being ignored and saved the day.

None of us is vegetarian or vegan, so we appreciated having a full menu of meat friendly options - something we've found to not be the case with many of the surrounding restaurants in Mt. Airy. All three of us live out of the area so we're always on a quest to find good places to dine while in town for classes.

Service - Mostly prompt and right on point. We were seated immediately and drink orders (beer all around) placed. It took a bit longer than expected to receive the drinks, plus to order and receive our meals. But we weren't in any hurry whatsoever, so this didn't pose a real issue.

Ambiance - Grain Exchange has a warm, inviting feel to it which felt more akin to visiting with friends in their home than in a restaurant. It was busy, but not packed, and the noise level wasn't excessive. It has a distinct pub feel to it and it was easy to unwind and relax with good friends.

Beer - We eached ordered something different from the tap, ranging from a light pilsner to a dark ale. We deliberately switched it up for the second round so combined we could try six different brews. None disappointed, and the price was reasonable for the neighborhood.

Meal - Between us we had the fried chicken sandwich, the scallops and the open face meatloaf sandwich. All three were good, solid choices - if nothing particularly extraordinary. Nothing wrong, but nothing in the 'OMG - where has this been all my life?' realm either.

Price - Dinner for the three of us, including two rounds of drinks, came in at just shy of $100. This was a bit higher than expected for the neighborhood, but across the board everything was above average so it wasn't an issue. Especially for my friends, since dinner/drinks was my treat.

I was on my way to the Tower Theater with a friend and we decided to stop in here for a quick meal on the way.  It was a short walk from the Frankford el and the yelp reviews had me very very interested.

We arrived to this not so fancy fast-food-like dining room that was too clean to be fast food so we stepped up to the counter and received a friendly greeting.  The menu looked good and really affordable.  My friend ordered the Marquez lamb sausage platter with really great fresh hummus.  I had the Lamb Ketban platter which was so  tender and delicious.  I liked  the Zaalouk appetizer I chose for my platter.  The platters are a decent size coming with salad and sauces and saffron rice.

I love 'hole in the wall' family restaurants like Sky Cafe. Everything is under $7, portions are just right, and food is very satisfying and tasty. 

The fried wontons and beef/pork satay are great. Wontons are super crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. The sweet sauce goes very well with it. The beef and pork skewers are perfectly grilled. I eat it without the peanut sauce because I'm allergic, but my friends love it. The cucumber dices on top of the satay are a nice touch too.

My favorite dish is the Mie Komplit. It consists of egg noodles, veggies, beef & mushroom, bbq pork, marinated egg, and smaller versions of the fried wontons. It comes with a side of soup that you can pour over or drink separately (I prefer separately). It definitely hits the spot. If you prefer a (coconut) rice dish, I recommend Nasi Lemak!

I've also tried some of the curry and spicy dishes. I'm fine with Chinese and Korean spiciness, but WOW Indonesian spicy is on a whole new level! Gross but my nose starts getting runny and tears roll down my cheeks after 2 bites haha. I can't handle it, but those who have high spicy food tolerance will be very happy here!

After the meal, I usually like to buy their homemade snacks that they have stacked up on the shelves in the back. Not sure what it's called, but I love their mildly spicy, fried noodles/fish/sesame thingy. I can snack on them all day. Their thousand layered cake (lapis legit) is also good! 

It's a small place (about 7 tables), but service is quick and you usually don't have to wait more than 5-10 minutes for a seat.

The service was very, very slow, with the exception of the on-the-ball bus person.  When we first arrived, we had only one menu among us.  The server told us more were being printed and she would get them for us right away.  About ten minutes later, another server asked us for our order, and we asked him for menus.  Once we had the menus and began to order, the server notified us that they no longer allow tables to mix prix fixe with the standard menu orders, so we had to look over the menu and decide among us which we would order.  It would have been good to know this when we sat down.  We brought our own wine, and both the first and second servers told us they would place the bottles on ice for us.  It never happened.  After our dessert, we ordered coffee.  Five or so minutes later yet a third server asked us if we would like coffee or tea.  Luckily, the bus person who was the night's standout of efficiency and speed, was already there with the coffee.  

The music was so loud, that it was difficult for us to hear one another.

CB went into full on fat man mode;chicken fried steak , two eggs,potatoes,biscuit and a side of turkey sausage... (a heart attack waiting to happen)
Our food came out pretty quick and we dove right in. I still had my own private thoughts about  this place. The food can't be denied as great and well matched with a fair price tag. My grits were amazingly smooth and creamy, the challah was perfection and the potatoe latke was brown and crisp on the outside  while moist and flaky on the inside . You cant really mess up eggs so they don't get snaps for them. The blueberry jelly is also worth a mention. CB was still talking about that chicken fried steak for the remainder of the day so I can safely assume he would want snaps to be mentioned for that poor cow he devoured.
I can't give honeys 5 stars for a few reasons the 10 min wait for us to be greeted was a little much especially since I was starving. The menu slightly deceived me and I ended up being charged for a side I thought came with my entree.

I got the shrimp, fried mahi, and carnitas tacos. Shrimp was absolutely my favorite. I think the fried ones fell short, so stick to that tasty glaze they have going.

There is a high level of detail that goes into these from the tiny chopped chives on top to the thin cabbage or pickled radish that gives these tacos some style. 

We had guac and salsa to start and those needed a little work. Guac had pretty big chunks of everything. The kitchen staff also needs a little work in not staring at you and winking while you eat. Still think they have a wonderful ambiance and are taco-tastic so it didn't break the 5 star deal.

SERVICE
Stephanie, our hostess, took us to our table.  She was incredibly friendly, chatting with us along the way.

Our server was above par. She was patient with us, as we talked and were pretty slow to order.  

FOOD
Calamari appetizer -- the flavor was tad on the salty side, but tender.  I wish there had been more meatier pieces.  The sauce was mild and went nicely with the calamari.  The appetizer was also large enough for the two of us to share.

Bottled carbonated water -- they offer carbonated Saratoga water in two sizes: 12 oz and 1 liter. I told our server that I'd get the liter if I could take it home. Our server provided the bottle cap so that I could do just that. Cost: $6+.  

Chicken and waffles with syrup -- my date ordered this entree and said that the syrup was tasty, though it wasn't pure maple syrup.  He did eat everything on his plate, so I assume it was tasty.  It appears that the entree came with a bowl of soup.  I saw it next to his plate, but I didn't touch it.

Deviled eggs -- you get two eggs halved for a total of 4 deviled eggs.  We didn't like them.  They tasted like an amalgamation of food odors in the refrigerator.  My date said he tasted something sour, so I suggested that maybe the ingredients included sour cream.  Anywho, we left the other two deviled eggs on the plate, along with what was left over from the halves we tasted. 

Macaroni and cheese -- it comes with a crumble topping and you can add bacon if you'd like.  EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH BACON. So that was a no-brainer.  It was pretty decent.  I'd order it again if I went back.

Our bill came to $50.xx.

There were a lot of burgers to choose from. My boyfriend and I split the Buckaroo and the El Matador. Both sounded good on the menu. When we placed our orders, we had to call or server back to find out how our meat world be cooked. She said it always comes out medium. That's definitely helpful information they should share with us. 

We also wanted to try some fries and onion rings. Our server told us we could get a side or a snack. She didn't really explain how much each served, so we went with the snack since she said that would be enough to share. It was definitely too much for us, so we would've liked a better description of the sizes. The fries were not that memorable, but I did really enjoy the onion rings. It had great seasoning! This snack came with four sauces. I really liked the smoke sauce. I expected the habenaro mayo to be spicier. 

As for the El Matador, it was just okay. The bread was a bit dry for our taste. But overall, there wasn't much to complain about this burger. The Buckaroo, however, was delicious. There was a quarter of a piece if lettuce sticking out the side of this burger--I got excited that it came with some lettuce, but it didn't. I'm guessing that was a mistake. The sauce and brisket on top of that beef was scrumptious. The sauce definitely made the dry bread seem moist. I found myself dipping the burger in more smoke sauce. 


The place is pretty spacious, a lot bigger than I thought it would be and it had a bit of hipstery feel. The only problem I had with the furniture was that the chairs weren't sanded well and it kept tugging on my tights.

Overall, it was a decent place with unique items. Compared to other burger places in the neighborhood, I'd probably still go to Burgerfi over Bareburger on a regular day.

After a mopping a girl took out a box of straws. They dropped onto the floor. All still wrapped. She picked them all up and threw away probably 300+ straws. A customer commented that it seemed a waste. She kindly explained  it was illegal to keep anything that touched the floor. 

Another time someone returned the wrong order, the gentleman behind the counter threw the food away. The customer whose order it was, said that he would take it rather than wait. The gentleman explained he could not do that, and all food had to be made fresh, despite the customer almost begging the worker to let him have his returned order.

Since my kids play sports on weekends, the time of a late lunch (around 1:45) seemed perfect for a spot which normally is known for long lines.

When we arrived, there were no lines, but there WERE precious few seats.  Two long tables that seat about six, and some counter space along the wall (which could also probably seat six, but we were four, and the counter seats were spaced out by singles, making the prospect of us eating together as a family pretty slim.  However, I had not counted on the prep time being significantly longer than the Five Guys to which we have grown accustomed.  While waiting for our orders (behind about 5 other single orders) , a group of four was able to leisurely finish their meal, vacating their seats just in time for us to snag them before another family walked in.

Where Five Guys has learned the art of ""Production Line"" cook-to-order by having ""specialists"" work the respective stations of counter cashier, grill, fryer, toppings,  assembly etc. 500F has TWO guys working at their own pace to do the same job (with a more limited menu.)   While the counter guy was friendly enough, and able to crack a joke or two (he also was in charge of milkshakes) both he and the cook worked at a pace less than adequate to handle the volume this business does. I'm not saying they were slow (to the contrary, especially the cook worked like a madman, flipping between grilling, frying, saucing and plating.) Incidentally, he slipped on a fresh pair of latex gloves between each serving.)

The burgers are, in fact, tasty, and cooked-to-order unlike the well-done-only policy of Five Guys.  Because of this, 500F does not need the 70-30 lean to fat ratio of Five Guys to make a moist burger.  500F tasted much less greasy, and of higher quality beef.  Mine was cooked a perfect medium rare, as were my son and daughter's.  My wife, unfortunately, had to pay the penalty of the cook's inability to deal with the volume and complexity of  orders, and her burger was pretty much raw inside (though ordered medium rare.)  We don't even mind rare, but this was tartare.  Because it was doused in Blue Cheese etc. it was not an item that could have been returned to the grill for a minute to rectify.

500F has a HOT grill which SEARS the hell out of the meat.  This is what makes these burgers so standout,  Here is the scientific explanation:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction

The caramelized nature of these burgers is the key to their delicious flavor.  This can't be matched by high-fat beef on a low-heat griddle being smashed by a weight ( a serious no-no to real burger chefs, but necessary to squeeze SOME of the fat out of a Five Guys burger.  The brioche buns were fresh and soft, and  a perfect compliment to a premium burger.

We ordered two truffle fries, one plain and one spicy.  We got one truffle fries, THREE plain and one spicy,  I appreciated the extra order, but would have preferred the correct one.  This was not a situation where one had the leisure to dicker with the staff over what you received if it was a trifle (not to be confused with a truffle.)  The nature of shoestring fries is that they cool down VERY quickly, especially if sprinkled with stuff (like vinegar.)  I do not believe these are fresh-cut fries.  They tasted like very high-quality frozen ones, but I much prefer the fries from Five Guys (where you KNOW the origin of the spuds.)  500F fries are better than average, but for a joint that sells nothing BUT burgers and fries, you are right to expect everything to be spectacular.

Shakes were very good (freshly made with great care) and the soda fountain had pretty cool stuff with real sugar (like Alex's Lemonade.)

I guess I'd go back if I were walking past it on the way to Chris' Jazz Cafe' or something, but would not drive back from Bala Cynwyd and pay to park (though the lot up the street only whacked us $5.00 because we were in and out inside of an hour.)

There was no indication at the location that credit cards were accepted, so I ended up paying cash.  I was subsequently notified via email that cards ARE accepted, so no need to tap MAC heavily before entering.  

In all, the burger is on a par with Rouge, which means it, in itself, is a bargain if taken in that context.  I would, at this point, make an effort to stay away from busy times, and go when the chef has time to work under no duress.  There is not enough space in the grill area to accommodate a crew of five, but I think if the owners would splurge on ONE third hand, they would be able to crank out orders much more efficiently and correctly (meaning more repeat business.)  As it stands, I'm sure their lack of complaints is only due to well-bred clientele who don't talk with their mouths full.",2011-03-27 01:37:16,"{'food': ['burgers', 'fries', 'shakes'], 'drink': ['soda']}"

I'm only assuming that they have takeout, and if they do, I'd say do that versus trying to eat in. It is clean though. No empty dishes sit around for very long at all, as they have someone promptly cleaning up everything the second people are done.
The menu is small. That didn't bother me, but with a small menu comes big expectations. I feel like things should be executed amazingly if you aren't juggling a lengthy list of things to make. I ordered the ""fish taco of the month,"" which was a chile swordfish. I only ordered one, being they were $4.50 a pop. I also ordered some chips and guac. Everyone else I was with ordered quesadillas. They also serve beer and other libations for you drinkers out there. I even saw an option for soft serve ice cream. The four of us split two and two. The total being about 25 dollars for two of us, which I thought was a little crazy for what we ordered, but I minded my comments until I saw and tasted the food. We were given a number so the employees could drop our food to us when it was finished. Boom.
Food came out pretty quick. My taco was good. It wasn't great or mind blowing, but I did like it. It was very small, as well as the piece of fish on there. People kept telling me to go get another one since it wasn't much, but the price just wasn't really worth it to me. The chips were okay. I will speak volumes about that guac though. Super chunky and super delicious. I could have eaten that with a spoon. I tasted one of the chicken quesadillas, which was pretty good as well. 

Overall... not a bad experience at all. It just wasn't the best thing in the world either, and I kind of felt indifferent about it when I left.",2015-10-15 21:38:37,"{'food': ['fish taco of the month', 'chicken quesadilla'], 'drink': ['beer']}"

We were having an impromptu celebration of his job promotion and decided to try out In Riva because we'd heard good things about this newish place.

Even though we were the first customers for dinner that night it didn't feel empty or imposing and more customers arrived shortly after we sat down. We decided to order the tasting menu for the both of us which is $30 a person. There ended up being 5 dishes with a dessert. The pace of the meal was slow, which was kind of annoying. The meal was decided for us, which, honestly i would not do again...not because the food was not good, but because i didnt particularly feel the choices the kitchen made were all that interesting....

anyways we started with the Cecibeans and lentils with charred bread and burrata caprese. Yum!  Both were delicious, especially the burrata.Next was spicy mussels and the Pork rib. The mussels were just ok. I didn't get why there was so much pepperoni. It was a strong flavor that kind of took over the dish. The rib was great, tender and full of flavor. Then we were brought a sausage and peppers pizza. Which was snnnnooooozzzzeeee BORING!!! Such a disappointing way to end an otherwise nice meal. I mean it wasn't baaad or anything but def not interesting or knock your socks off which is kinda what I wanted. And lastly they gave us a trio of cannolis which were just barely ok. I don't think we even ate them all.

The yams  and potato salad were fantastic.  I had a craving for some potato salad for a few weeks and this was freshly made and still warm.  The yams were not too sweet and not too runny.

As for it being run down, the lobby and hallway carpets need to be cleaned or replaced, but otherwise it is quite a nice looking hotel. 

Pros: 1. Excellent in-room coffee from a Keurig coffee maker. 2. Lovely lobby, elegantly decorated for Xmas. 3. A really great staff - friendly and hard-working. 4. A nice, clean room. 

Cons. 1. We were given a room with 2 double beds - we called down and asked for a room with a Queen or King and were told there were none left. Hotels must know that there aren't any couples who want to sleep in a double bed. Plus the comforter was too small for the bed. 2. Add to this the fact (previously mentioned in a review) that you can hear everything in the hallway (talking, doors closing) and you end up with some sleep quality problems.

We had a great time overall, and at one point when a woman came over to check on us, and we complimented the fact that a Bayside song was playing, she said her brother is the chef & owner and chooses the music himself. This is a really interesting place, because there were couples around 20 yrs old and couples around 80 yrs old, and everyone seemed happy.

The food was really good. I'm not giving 5 stars because I didn't feel the urge to come back the very next day, but I would still choose In Riva over a lot of other places in center city.

Crispy artichokes - These are fried. Unique, and good, but i wouldn't get them again.
Gnocchi - Great, I would definitely get this again even though it's a small portion.
Riesling - Way too sweet for my taste.
Quattro Formaggi pizza - We added prosciutto & arugula, and this was awesome. I'm from NY and definitely picky about pizza. The only other place I've enjoyed pizza in Philadelphia was Barbuzzo. I don't know how good this would've been without the prosciutto and arugula, but the ingredients were very good and the dough was soft and delicious.

Cannoli - You get a chocolate, pistachio, and some other flavor. Pistachio was good, chocolate was OK, and the other flavor was awful. They said dessert is complimentary for a birthday, but they charged me for it. I discussed it with them beforehand, and the waiter brought it out without me having to order it, which was good, but when he delivered it he ran away leaving me to sing the rest of the happy birthday song alone...

I'm not likely to go back unless I hear from one of my co workers that things have imporved. Sorry Citi Market place! I hope you guys get it together and get back to the way things used to be.

The first time I got a sushirrito from here, the ingredients were not fresh (the tempura was tasteless and veggies were limp) and they skimped so hard! The sushirrito was 75% rice and 25% ingredients... For $9-11, I'd rather get a healthier and yummier salad from Greek Lady or go to Jake's Sandwich Board next door for their BOGO cheesesteaks, thank you. After a 10-month hiatus, I decided to give them another try and went back with friends for Ai Ramen's pop-up shop. $11 after tax for their Ai Ramen was what I expected to pay, but their ""24-hour super amazing pork broth"" was pretty watery (maybe watered down?) and the flavor was just salt. Compared to Terakawa or Ramen Bar, it was definitely bringing up the rear. Just saying, Ai Ramen has a location in Rittenhouse inn the Shops at Liberty and had heard mixed reviews, but wanted to try it for myself. Well, now I know! The reason I'm giving 3-stars is because I appreciate their creativity and modernness. I do see their Hai Street Kitchen & Co food truck which looks so cool it makes me want to go eat there even though I know the quality of food is not the greatest... and the fact that they're one of the only sushi with a modern twist (compared to Mizu next door which is your regular small tiny sushi rolls). I'm from California so maybe that's why this review is pretty harsh (#sorrynotsorry), but I do appreciate the strides they're taking in University City.

First off let me say that I really like there food! I was so excited to show my friends a great Greek restaurant in Philadelphia ( as I managed one in NJ ) I had to use the rest room there was no toilet paper. Hey it happens!!  There was paper towels instead. I told the waiter. Then when we asked for more bread and oil the server said NO I don't want you to fill up on bread! I have never been told NO by a server when asking for more bread 30 years in the business as a chef and manager I was appalled and embarrassed.  Next he forgot my friends diet coke no big deal.  I had to ask for pita 7 times which they do charge you for. No problem I don't mind paying but when I tell you to bring out lots of pita we are pita people bring it out! Our one guest is limited to certain foods so she orders salad and never comes.  Waiter ( order taker) looks at us like we are lying and says we never order it. We get more dips xtra octopus
I have to tell you I have been cooking and managing for years the food here is good Greek food.  I started to feel sick I ate dips,  octopus and artichokes as my meal. I went to the ladies room and got sick. Again no toilet paper.  Again on my way out I  paid cash and generous tip ( which should be lower due to the smirking order takers)
I said to him I told someone about the no toilet paper he said there is paper towels cause we ran out! Are you serious?   Go to the store and get some!  2nd reason I won't be back.
We then leave. One more person gets sick eating the dips after ordering a second fish roe dip. The 3rd gets sick 2 hours after him. The 4th got sick an hour after. The only one that didn't get sick was the person who didn't eat any dips. I called and who ever answered the phone seems not to believe us. It happens in every restaurant I understand you get defensive it's natural. 
I really love there food!  But I won't be back and it's not so much we got sick all 4 of us.
It's because of the wait staff.
Being told NO for bread was wrong. I'm paying for that bread it isn't free it's worked into the bill. Plus you don't tell a guest NO.
The no toilet paper really bothered me when the server said they were out. Go buy some. Health Hazzard plus really you are asking ladies to use paper towels.
Forgetting our coke was okay it happens.  But forgetting someone's dish for there meal is something else. ( there is another review about this) I'm saddened by the turn of events that happen last night. I won't be paying cash anymore either I learned my lesson.  If I paid by card I would have canceled it due to us 4 getting sick.  So they are lucky I paid cash. The bill was low 105 $ but it was all apps.
I gave 26$ tip. ( always tip cash for servers because they sometimes have to wait a week to get there tips) 
Again love the food just won't be back. They need to tighten up on line checks and temps and rotation of products so people don't get sick. I wouldn't question if it was just me but 4 of us??",2014-10-22 14:17:13,

First off, seeing as it seemed to advertised itself as being a dive bar, I asked if they served City Wides (a beer and a shot for around $5). Bartenders looked at me like I was bat shit insane. You're a 'dive bar' in the heart of Old City, Philadelphia and you've never even heard of a city wide? The bartender, though, asked me to explain was it was. ""It's usually a can of PBR and a shot of the cheap-ish whiskey for around $5"". He told me that he had both of those things and that he'd ""whip one up for me"". When I got the bill shortly after, I found out that he charged me $11 for something that would have cost me $5 at another other dive. When I asked him why it was so much more expensive he very proudly told me that he gave me a shot of Jameson instead of the cheapest whiskey that they offered. If I request cheap liquor, it means I'm not looking to spend a ton of money. And, if you're going to substitute cheap whiskey for something like Jameson without my knowledge, don't charge me. I was not happy. 

About 10 minutes into our visit, my friend and I were politely talking with the bartender when he randomly tells us that he has a whole handle of FIreball at his apartment in University City if we were willing to head over there with him (?). We weren't interested whatsoever and we were obvious about it, but he kept talking about us possibly going over. He even went as far to give us his address and directions. It was so weird.

Anyway, I went back to celebrate a friend's birthday, and the service was just outright atrocious! After about twenty minutes of waiting, we flagged down a passing waiter, who informed us that we had to wait for our waitress. After another ten minutes, I flagged down another staff member. He informed us that he was not a waiter, our waitress would be by soon. Interestingly, a little later, we saw him take a neighboring table's order, serve them their food, handle another table's bill, etc. Alrighty, not a waiter! By this point, I was dying of thirst, so I walked over to the bar to get a drink. I was informed by the bartender that I had to wait for our non-existent waitress to take our order since we had already been seated. Even when I stated that I was really thirsty and requested just a glass of sparkling water, I was directed to wait for this seemingly imaginary waitress. She did eventually turn up, nodded her head languidly as she listened to our orders (I was a little alarmed that she didn't seem to write anything down!), and promptly disappeared again. Twenty minutes later, she returned with our appetizers. My drink? Missing in action! I reminded her that I'd ordered a sparkling water with lime and no ice, and she claimed she would be right back. 

My salad arrived drowning in dressing (I'd asked for the dressing on the side). The arugula on the grilled truffle flatbread was fresh and nicely peppery, but the flatbread itself was disappointingly cold. We waited a good half an hour after finishing our appetizers before our entrees made an appearance. Still no sparkling water in sight! I had the vegetarian pot au feu, which was oversalted, and the spinach. I had asked for it to be steamed (it normally is sautéed), but it came drowning in oil anyway. Cold and oversalted too. The braised halibut was cold and bland, but the short ribs were decent. The lobster mac and cheese was pretty to look at, but less impressive on tasting. 

As they were clearing our entrée plates, I mentioned that I had ordered sparkling water with no ice, and was still waiting for it. I was informed that the restaurant had run out of sparkling water!! I requested club soda instead, with lime...no ice. A few minutes later, a waiter came by with an ice-filled glass of plain water. I mentioned that I had requested my drink without ice. He disappeared, never to return again with any liquid. 

I had noted in the reservation that it was my friend's birthday. For dessert, we all ended up ordering the warm vanilla cake. Delicious! Right after we were finished, our discombobulated waitress returned with an extra vanilla cake with a candle on top! We had all eaten dessert at this point. What exactly were we expected to do with this??  And that glass of water? I was still in dire need of fluid.

Needless to say, I was shocked when I got the bill to see the club soda that I never received on the bill. So was the extra vanilla cake that we hadn't ordered, which no one ate. Our inept waitress had also already added a 20% tip to the bill!

All in all, a disastrous experience! Not quite sure what their issues are these days. The restaurant was no busier than usual. They certainly had a lot of staff running around, none helpful. They just seemed to miss the mark on everything and were clearly off their game until it was time to get paid.

I have to say that this was my favorite dining experience in the city, so far. Everything is so original and Sbraga doesn't have the pretentiousness of other fine dining establishments in the city. 

We sat at the chef's counter and did the duck supplement. The foie gras soup is as good as they say. It truly is a beautifully complex yet absolutely perfect dish. The duck was very good. So moist and decadent. Frankly, there was not one dish that didn't feel complete or finished. I absolutely cannot wait to return. 

The price is well worth it. The menu is a $55 fixed price four course meal with additional supplements which you can opt in for (like the duck). Although this price may sound expensive to some, I feel as though I've paid much more for much less in this city.

The foundation of a great meal was laid with buttery Parker House rolls, always a crowd pleaser (and a over-eating risk).  We took quite a while to order as everything sounded top-notch.  Our server was spunky, fun, and attentive and knew the menu inside and out, with one exception (dessert) which she humbly admitted before retreating to get the low-down from the kitchen.  Unfortunately, the other staff were overly serious and lacked charm or warmth, but we got a great deal of attention even from the cheerless.

Our first course was a celery root and apple soup with Maine lobster, a creamy warm-up for a 10 degree night.  The black lentils with a poached egg and pheasant confit was a hearty and savory treat, augmented by a few small pieces of unadvertised bacon.  (Caveat:  all of the dishes we ordered had at least two unadvertised ingredients, so be sure to announce any dietary restrictions to your server).

The squash agnolotti seemed an apt choice for the season, with a decadent dollop of creamed brown butter, a brown butter and shallot sauce, and a few crunchy crumbs of amaretti cookies on top.  Everything worked together magnificently, and the squash was intriguingly spiced with locally-grown dried mace, a sample of which the server brought to our table.  

Our large plate was a lovely, moist chicken breast baked in hay, a stroke of genius that gave the bird a mellow grassy flavor.    The chicken came with crispy spaetzle and a large portion of house-made esplette sausage, moderately- spicy with a pleasant undertone of red peppers and herbs.  

For dessert, we swooned over the Chocolate Gianduja - a layer of chocolate mousse atop the gianduja, a crispy confection made of chocolate and hazelnut paste.  The plate was strewn with a rich ribbon of caramel, and some white chocolate malt pieces sat atop the mousse.  If you are going to splurge on dessert, this is a great choice.

Vegans? Forget about it! (****The lasagna is no longer on the menu and in its place there is now a Veggie Burger for $9.50 and Vegetarian Chili for $13.00***)

Known for their ""signature"" mac + cheese we had to give it a whirl for $10...But best in the city? Not exactly. It was good, even very good...but was it worth $1 per bite? No.  (***the price is now $8.00***)

The chicken nachos were, conversely, WELL worth their $11 price tag.  So much so that our party of 5 had a tough time finishing them.

The tuna tacos? Egh...Small and boring for $10+. Although I usually feel it's hard to find a salad worth $12, the Taco Salad was admittedly large enough to save leftovers for a follow up snack or the next days lite lunch. 

The Debbie Downer was hands down the pierogi's.  My boyfriend asked the server if this dish would be enough to accommodate his hungry appetite.  Had they never served them before?! Aside from being very tiny and having zero wow factor they were also $12+. The entire meal was not exactly affordable for what you're getting. Make reservations or you will wait...OUTSIDE.

The fried chicken comes out hot and crispy. You can tell it was freshly fried, the meat is tender and well seasoned, and the crust on it is unparalleled. It's paired perfectly with a sweet chili sauce. And of course you have the waffle which is not too soft, the right amount of bite and a side of syrup.

Over the years we have visited several great Italian places in South Philly like Mr. Martino's, Tre Scalini, and most recently, The Victor Cafe--all family owned restaurants which deliver not only delicious food, but also a unique ambiance and exceptional service. Tonite we celebrated a friend's birthday at Ralph's, which was an unfortunate disappointment.

To begin with, the food lacked anything unique in preparation, presentation or flavor. A plate of about 10 ravioli was about as drab as the stuff you find in Acme's frozen aisle...in fact, you'd have a hard time convincing me that my eggplant parmesan was not a frozen Celetano entree. A pile of fettuccini Alfredo arrived in a white dish without even a parsley sprig or sprinkle of herbs to make it look slightly appealing. Judging by the amount left on the dish, I would assume it tasted as good as it looked. The saving grace was the bread; it was everyone's favorite part of the dinner.

Secondly, the service was slow, spotty and unfriendly (except for the bread guy - again, the highlight of the meal). I hate to feel like I'm putting anyone out, especially when I'm paying them to make us feel special. They didn't even bother to wish the birthday girl a Happy Birthday. Our waiter prematurely removed our unfinished drinks and then charged us for refills. Anything to jack up the check, I guess. Other servers at Ralph's Italian Restaurant seemed equally blase, which made me long for the servers at the Victor -- not only do they give you proper attention, but they sing too.

Finally, Ralph's Italian Restaurant is not worth the high price we paid for such simple and unimaginative food. I have spent less at Mamma Maria's and Tre Scalini for much better quality, flavor and presentation of these traditional dishes. As a cash only establishment, you'd imagine they'd have a working ATM, but I had to walk a couple blocks away to tap PNC's ATM machine. That was the clincher for me. 

With so many options of the same genre so close by including Villa di Roma or Dante and Luigi's, I won't waste my time or money at Ralph's again.",2013-01-08 17:44:34,"{'food': ['ravioli', 'eggplant parmesan', 'fettuccini Alfredo'], 'drink': []}"

As a bar
  This is awesome.  It is dark and mellow.  There are 40 draft beer and depending upon whether there is an event, at least 6 are paired with a spirit; hence, Boilermaker.  Love the selection, not driven toward one variety so there is something for everyone who enjoys craft beer.  

As a restaurant
  This is a place to be skipped.  Come for the beverage and that is it.  They try way to hard to be bizzare.  At first glance the menu is standard pub fare: steak and eggs, cheese steak, fish and chips, pretzel with cheese, etc.  That is where it ends!  Steak is tartar (raw!) with eggs.  Cheese steak is made with rabbit, not beef.  And stay as far away from their interpretation of fish and chips. It is a whole trout, head and tail included wrapped in thin slices of potato.  The fish is mild to bland and the potato undercooked.  Plus the food prices are way to high for poor quality and strangeness.

The bar had some good people watching with a real mix of ages and backgrounds.  
We started with a Philadelphia fish house punch--very sweet and tasty but HIGHLY alcoholic.  Since I am a light weight one was all it took to get me pleasantly and happily buzzed.  There were tons and tons of beers and whiskies, as well as some very interesting cocktails that I want to get back to try sometime (particularly the aviation with creme de violette) but I'm pretty sure that 1 drink is all I can handle.
We ordered some small bites first: deviled eggs and house made philly pretzels.  I was very pleased that both the deviled eggs and the house made mustard had an actual kick.  Too often, spicy things at restaurants aren't spicy at all, so that was a good change.  The eggs were excellent, and we'd definitely order again.  Pretzels were good but not VERY good, and I'm not sure I would get them again.  I'm looking forward to trying the cheese puffs next time.
We skipped the house pickles, but looking at other people's tables they looked interesting.
We both got burgers and shared an order of the fries.  Fries and burgers were both very very good.  House made ketchup was a little bland and could use some more vinegar.

Lots of great spaces for small groups to gather in cushy booths and a cool bar that hearkens back to the Woolworth lunch counter.

The menu also hearkens back to mid-century food fads, with deviled eggs and pierogies on the menu. The cheese pierogies were fabulous! We also had a BBQ pulled pork sandwich and the pork had just the right amount of sweetness to it. My dining companion liked the shoestring french fries, though I prefer other varieties. The yummiest part of the meal though: the coleslaw that came with the pulled pork. It was so yummy! Frankly, I rarely like coleslaw in restaurants, let alone love it. But this was amazing!

Though we didn't order it, I love that you can design your own salad. They give you a small piece of paper with all the options (3 types of lettuce, various meats, nuts, veggies, dressings, etc.) and you pick precisely what you want on it.

If the waiter had been more attentive and not disappeared for most of the meal, it would have been five stars. We were there just after 9 p.m. on a Monday night and our waiter only had three small tables.

So there was lots of talk about this place recently with the whole Top Chef thing, but that wasn't my reason to go there for dinner...It's been on my list.

Anyway...it's in a really nice area on a small street close to  2nd and Pine in Headhouse Square.  Its interesting walking in since it splits off into 3 areas.  The first side is the bar area with some table, and on the other side was another area with mostly tables.  Downstairs  is the lounge which i think is very popular, since while we were there we noticed lots of people coming in and just heading straight downstairs.

The menu was pretty decent.  Lots of familiar things, and overall a good mix of ceviches, small plates and a few larger plates of meats and seafood and drinks and such.  However that saying, you won't find names like fajita, burrito, enchilada, etc. 

We started out with margaritas, which were actually really good.  But anything is pretty good with tequila right?  Then we had the ""Vuelve"" ceviche, shrimp octopus, scallops and oysters, which again was a nice starter.  Very refreshing and well portioned for two.  Next was some baby goat (don't knock it till you try it, goat in general I mean) and the parrillada, which was a mix of chicken, steak, shrimp and duck.  Interesting....my goat was pretty good, cooked well, could have done with some more heat and seasoning.  The parrillada was good as well.  

Service was great, our waitress was very attentive and made some good suggestions for us.

I was expecting something more, but it didn't really live up to all the hype for me.  Not saying I won't go back or it wasn't good, but that besides great presentation of food, nice drinks and a cool lounge, there is better mexican food to be had in town.",2009-08-24 00:26:15,"{'food': ['margaritas', 'Vuelve ceviche', 'baby goat', 'parrillada'], 'drink': ['margaritas']}"

1. They have seasonings on the side for you- real cheesesteak places won't have such a thing because their steaks are seasoned.. well.

 Old City tends to cater to their regulars of Friday and Saturday nights but on a Wednesday night I was striking out on finding something to eat at least until I could fix something at home. Into the Khyber Pub I come. My first seating choice was in the back away from the bar but as I took my jacket off I noticed it was a little cold and empty down there.
 I changed my mind and found seating at the bar and even though it was more noisy up there with music playing Rock & Roll, the general din of the crowd and the t.v;'s, it was much warmer up there as well.
 Not seeing very much on the menu that I liked, I decided on the Gumbo and Onion rings with a Draft cider. 
The Gumbo was pretty good. Not as good as authentic New Orleans Gumbo which I had the pleasure of having years ago pre-Katrina but it was still good; there the temperature of it was hot, the taste spicy and plenty of shrimp throughout the bowl. Here it was very basic but at least the onion rings were real.
 Not those frozen in the bag, super market kind and if they were, they didn't taste like it and they didn't break up like they do either. The draft cider was locally made and very weak to the taste. Whenever I drink alcohol it's NEVER to get lit or tipsy, it's ALWAYS for the taste and the ingredients of the drink itself. I don't like them sweet or too strong but I don't like them watery and weak either.

The good: The hotel is in a really nice location on Market Street within walking distance to a lot of shopping and eating, as well as Chinatown. I had very good impressions of the hotel staff and I really liked the way the rooms were arranged and decorated.  The conference room on the 33rd floor had a gorgeous view of the river and surrounding areas. The food downstairs (apparently the bar is a local hangout spot) was also pretty decent. 

The bad: My biggest complaint which would hinder me from coming back here is that the key cards SUCK. I don't know if the technology is outdated or they are just overwhelmed because they had a busy weekend. I was paired up with a roommate during the conference and checked into our room first. I went out to lunch, but when I came back my card had stopped working. When I went downstairs I was told that someone accidentally deleted my copy of the key when my roommate checked in. I was like wtf? So I asked for a new key. During the course of two days, I've had to swipe my key multiple times, sometimes up to 20, in order to get into the room. The keypad kept flashing yellow and red even though I knew the key was working. UGH it was so frustrating.

I was STUFFED after half a rack of ribs and she couldn't finish the sandwich and french fries.

As for the food... El Camino Real isn't the ""hipster take"" on BBQ. It's just really good Texas style BBQ. The ribs were good and the sauce on them was fantastic. Girlfriend had the rib sandwich and fries which she said was excellent. Imagine Famous Dave's, except really good and high quality. (we didn't try the Mexican, though).

I chose this place because it was the closest place to work with Indian food. I called ahead and the order took little time to be ready. I ordered the Lamb Saag and some samosas.

As this was purely a take-out order I won't comment much on the service but I did witness some freebies being given to a group of customers dining in. The dining area is minimal but I personally don't mind for this kind of place which likely is focused on take-out. Also, I give smaller places a pass because of what they might be able to afford.

The real test is the food which was very tasty. Note that you can customize the spice level to your liking. I chose medium and there was just enough spice for me without leaving me numb in the mouth. The saag was different from what I've had before but I think this might be a regional variation (in India and Pakistan). I didn't love that the samosas were cold but perhaps this is the way they are supposed to be (thinking street food). This does mean that they are made in batches and are kept in the dining room waiting to be served. I personally would have preferred them warmed up.

Things to note: $10 minimum was what I remember seeing posted and the order did not come with utensils. I did not ask for them and didn't notice when the order was bagged right in front of me.

Service is more than friendly; from the hostess who sat us with no reservation, to the waterboy to the 2nd waiter and the gm who stopped at the table to see if there was anything else we needed.  The service here makes all the difference.

Chinese food is very eclectic and each person likes different aspects of it.  Once thing I will say is the chilli oil is hot, and it's a kind of heat that sneaks up on you 10 minutes into eating, so make sure you order a couple of dishes without it.

We had about 10 items on the menu between us, no complaints on any of them, but it's not my favorite cuisine and there was nothing I just have to go back and have.  I'm sure we'll be back though in the coming months for the group choice and will be sure to try everything else.

How are you going to have such big talk about this stuff and not follow through?  It's like false advertisement.  It's what brings in your patrons and if you're not going to comply, why advertise at all?  Also, the only sized crabs they had available was regular and large.  Even worse, it wasn't fresh and was extremely salty.  Hold back on the Old Bay seasoning, will ya?  Huge disappointment for big seafood goers.

I've been here dozens of times and Chef Eli is one of the best in Philadelphia. When you walk in it may not feel like more than a pub (dark, moody and sometimes loud), but every dish is carefully thought out, and much more than 'pub' fare. (chunks of lamb bacon in caramelized brussels?!)

The service is lovely, from bartenders and hosts to even the runners. They are all also very knowledgable about the dishes, never having to run back to the kitchen when you ask what the side sauce is made of.

Best times to go: brunch or week night dinner. Happy hour gets a little crazy and filled with bros ordering burgers. The burger is incredible, but there is more to gain from trying whatever weird paté is in the starters section or the beet salad. Same goes for brunch, go with something you wouldn't normally order - you won't be disappointed by any of the food (unless you're really sensitive to salt and seasoning, nothing is tasteless here).

Drinks are steep - unless you're getting beer during happy hour, but that's typical given the neighborhood. And at least when you pay $11/12 for an old fashioned - it isn't simply a maraschino cherry plopped into watered-down bourbon.

We were a party of 6 which wanted to try the restaurant on Friday night. We walked in to put our names in around 815pm and they told us that realistically with the kitchen closing at 10 they could not seat us. We left our information anyway. We were on our way to another restaurant when they called us at 915 saying they could seat us if we wanted at 930. Since we were very excited to try this new place we rearranged our plans and then called them back to let them know we could make the reservation. 

When we got there we were missing 1 of the 6 people who had just run home to drop off a bag.  We understood that the policy was to have everyone there to be seated but it was also 930pm and we were going to be the last table sitting there.  We explained this to one person at the door stating that we were missing 1 person but we did not need to wait for them to order and that they were just a few mins behind.   We were cold and hungry and ready to sit down.  It seemed like they would let us sit down. 

This is when the tall man with the beard came over and told us that we absolutely could not sit down that policy was policy because if someone else walked in with a full party they would give away our table. What???  His demeanor was extremely unfriendly and his policy and reasoning for the policy absurd.  When we tried to reason with him he said - 'we can do this all night, you're not sitting until complete. '  

We were actually debating leaving because we felt so unwelcome.  The last person then arrived (within 5 mins as we had told him) and due to the late hour we decided to stay.

Then when we sat down someone asked for bread as we were reviewing the menus and the response was 'you'll get bread once you order'.  Did he think we were going to eat the bread and leave without ordering food? 

I understand that restaurants have policies in place for a reason but there should also be some common sense and courtesy applied to the situation which in this case was not done.

Our group of 8 really enjoyed our time here, especially since we had some first-timers. We came well stocked with wines and beers to supplement a multiple course dinner!

After covering ourselves in towels and washing our hands, it was time to get down to business. Towels were great since eating with your hands is not an easy feat, at least not for me. Course after course, we indulged and explored new and interesting tastes. We all raved about the first 3-salad course of eggplant, carrot, and cucumbers. Don't hold back on the pita. Grab 3 or 4 because you'll need them to help grab the veggies! The second course of B'stella was great! By looking at the towels around me, this was the messiest dish. The third course of spicy chicken literally fell off the bone, and was very flavorful. It came out super hot, so the pitas that came around helped. For our fourth course, we chose the lamb with almonds and honey over the beef. The lamb did not disappoint, and the honey definitely added just the right amount of sweetness. By this time, all of us were stuffed, yet we had two more courses! The couscous was probably our least favorite since it had to follow some strong dishes. Thankfully, the fruit and delicious mint tea helped slow things down. Baklava was also a nice treat, thought it wasn't anything to write home about.

Overall, I'd recommend this place. For date nights, group dinners, and large celebrations. Since it was such a large feast, perhaps slowing down the pace will help!

They were able to accommodate all of us at a round table. It was not too crowded there. Overall, I really enjoyed the food and I think this is one of the best chinese restaurants in Philly. 

We ordered a bunch of dishes, so here are my thoughts that stood out. Our table did like the food a lot:

Hot Sauce beef. This was a really good dish. The beef was tender, and the oil had a good spicy flavor. This could have had more peppercorns.
Lazi Chicken (dry spice chicken). The classic sichuan dish was very well executed and light and crispy. The signature dish!
The cold pork belly appetizer was very good, and its something that you don't see that often. 
The Dan Dan noodles were great. There was a good peanut flavor without being excessive. We ordered 3 of them and everyone loved it. This was the favorite of the table.
We got an eggplant dish, I think I was spicy garlic style. I feel like this dish could have used something crunchy or kind of garnish. 
The one dish that was a miss was the smoked beer duck. It was listed as a specialty, but there was not too much tenderness/spice to it.
 
Overall I think the dishes were slightly lacking in spiciness. Maybe for more western diners it was spicy, but from other Sichuan restaurants I went to, the spice level could have been increased especially for the (10) spicy dishes. There could be more peppercorns in the dishes for the numbing flavor.

Service: Although the food came really really fast, I thought that the waiter could have been more attentive. They didn't really come to check in on us enough as we ordered a second round and we had to wait a while. They could have cleared each of our plates quicker and given us a lot more rice.This and the spiciness issue above made me dock just 1 star.

They had my attention at whiskey. Now that I have been there, I am REALLY excited! 

Last night, after the show (work) my castmates and I were walking up the alley and were greeted with heavenly steak aromas permeating the air. Sure beats what you usually smell in an alley in Philly, but I digress. I asked what that was and my friend told me it was Twisted Tail and that he had an amazing steak there earlier for dinner before the show (work). We peeked in the window, saw space at the bar, and headed on in. 

I had a Johnnie Walker based drink with word ""Smokestack"" in the name. It had macerated cherries in it and was garnished with two morasca cherries. I took one sip and announced that I wanted to make friends with the drink. I asked about morasca cherries, and the owner himself gave me his supplier's info. If you have never had a morasca cherry, you should. These make regular maraschino cherries ashamed of themselves. 

One of my other friends is a real beer guy and was very impressed that they had his all-time favorite beer on tap. I believe it is called Heffelwiesen? Something like that . Anyway, it was the first time he had ever seen it on tap and was ecstatic. 

Another enjoyable drink was the Lynchburg Lemonade with basil. The basil was a lovely touch as it saved the drink from being overly sweet. It also had an unexpected bit of peach flavor that hit the middle of the tongue. It was served in a glass that looked no unlike a miniature old fashioned milk bottle. 

Finally there was the mint julep. Oh. My. GOD. I was to make love to this drink. I want to bathe in it. It was that good! This mint julep was SO good, I announced that I wanted a moment alone with it and the guys all laughed. 

What impressed me the most was the complexity of the cocktail. First you got the bourbon, but it was a good bourbon with no burn. Then you got the sweetness of the housemade julep syrup, and finally a cool minty finish. I am in love. 

I was a little hungry so I ordered a bowl of Primal Chili. I admit the name caught my eye. It was a blend of chicken, lamb, and duck with white beans, a blend of smoky seasonings and - wait for it - chocolate sea salt(!). When it arrived, I tasted a bit of the sea salt on its own and was amazed at the strong cocoa flavor that came from it. I didn't expect it to be that intense. Then, as per the bartender's advice, I mixed the salt in very thoroughly. It was delicious. Smoky, complex, a little sweet, and a teeny bit of heat. If you like your chili five alarm, you will not like this. But if you want a savory, meaty, comfort food, you will love this. I let out a subdued howl after eating it; it is called Primal Chili after all. 

The place is not cheap (my drinks were around 10 dollars each) but if the food is good, I don't mind.

Well, I enjoyed myself very much but there were a few things that bothered me.

Number one, I ordered a ""rowhouse red"" beer and was brought a glass of house red wine. Anyone who knows me will understand that it's not a big deal and I will drink any red wine anyone puts in front of me...BUT we are at a taproom, i pointed to the beer menu and said ""rowhouse red.""

Secondly, our waitress went through the grilled cheese specials three times and each time she pronounced ""challah"" a different incorrect way. The first time my shiksa friend picked up on it even before I did! The second time, was close to correct but still not, and the third time sounded like a mix of ""Shalom"" and ""Ahoy.""

Anyway, I had the grilled challah and jack cheese sandwich with tomatoe soup. Now listen, the tomatoe soup was good, but it wasn't soup, it was more like crushed tomatoes and cream. I felt like I was lifting a three pound weight to my mouth every time I took a spoonfull. 

My friend got the burger which she was over the moon about...Something about not eating a burger in months because when she was in Spain, she ate the entire nation's meat rations...

The hubs had the grilled cheese special which was rye bread with jack, blue, and a chutney. He liked it, but didn't go cuhrazy for it.

I really like the theme of the hotel - renovated bank; complete with vault in the lobby and beautiful marble throughout. Parking was your typical hotel price - $50 a night, but we were guided to a parking garage around the corner which was only $19 a night. Check in was a breeze and only took a few minutes.

I was extremely happy with the size of my room! The view was okay from the 20th floor... From what I understand, the views are beautiful from the higher floors. We ordered room service both mornings, it was delivered hot and quickly!

We stopped by their restaurant - Bank and Bourbon. Enjoyed their bourbon flight and their cheese plate. Friendly staff - our waitress was more than happy to provide suggestions on dining, drinking and sight seeing in the area.

While I wasn't able to use their gym I did take a peak... it was honestly the biggest and most complete hotel gym I have ever seen. You can even book personal training sessions there!

Upon checkout, there was a billing discrepancy, but the staff immediately went above and beyond and corrected the error.

The Roti Canai. Picture a crispy stretched out nan /crepe dipped in delicious curry sauce.
Chicken, Beef, and Tofu Satay. really tender and the sauce is delicious.
Beef Rendang. Delicious and always tender.
Beef Chow Fun. Classic and awesome.
What my dad calls kang kong with garlic sauce, but is on the menu as ""convolus"" it's a spinachy, delicious vegetable, that is kinda hard to come by usually.

They weren't too bad at first but after a while they got pretty restless, needless to say...
The meal was good for the most part.  I ordered the Filet Oscar which seems to be the specialty.  I don't eat uncooked meat so I asked for it well done.  Unfortunately this is yet another restaurant that seems to think that well done means cooked dry & slightly burnt.  They asked if they could filet it and I concurred.  I've cooked plenty of steaks (including filet mignon) myself well-done without burning it and while still keeping it juicy. I don't know why trained chefs can't seem to do the same.  
Anyway, other than those things I can see how this would be an enjoyable place.  The only other fault I had was with the bathrooms.  The stairs are pretty steep and the restrooms weren't cleaned very well (or perhaps not regularly).  A steakhouse should not have bathrooms smelling of urine.

It's clean and neat, service is fast and friendly. Their menu is not the most diverse out there, but sometimes less is more when you want to be in and out quickly without agonizing over three or four pages of options.

I'll say right off the bat that this place is pricey: $2.50 per doughnut and almost $10 for four pieces of chicken. That said, the chicken is moist, tender and juicy with a perfectly satisfying crunch. You have several choices of dry and glazed flavorings; we went with honey ginger (glaze) and buttermilk ranch (dry). Both were great but I especially liked honey ginger.

The doughnuts left me a bit underwhelmed. I tend to dislike cake doughnuts to begin with, so that may factor into my opinion. I tried grapefruit brûlée and lemon ricotta. The first was definitely the better of the two, slightly more tart than sweet but still good. The glaze tasted a bit burnt towards the middle but this didn't bother me since it was minimal. The lemon, on the other hand, didn't taste much like lemon (just sweet) and there was zero evidence of ricotta.

Based on the expense, I wouldn't make this place a habit, but it's certainly a nice spot to drop by for a quick lunch and some sweets.",2015-08-24 19:32:01,"{'food': ['chicken', 'doughnuts'], 'drink': []}"

I am a meat lover, but I absolutely love the Crispy Shroom (portobello) burrito -- funny, it's probably my favorite actually. The Hai Street Chicken (chicken katsu) was great too. The Crunch (shrimp tempura) was ehh, not impressive -- too much mayo, and I'm not a fan of the spiciness and can't really taste the shrimp at all (very weak, mild taste). I tried each burrito with wasabi and thought the chicken and the shrimp burritos tasted better without it, but the portobello was amazing with it. The chicken and the shrimp had a lot of sauce/mayo, so I feel the wasabi killed the flavor of these burritos, making them taste kinda flat and soggy. However, the portobello was perfectly crispy and had only a light dressing, so the wasabi complemented it really well. (You really don't need to get the wasabi though, and I think you probably have to pay for that if you want it.)

People complain that the sushiburritos are expensive for the size, but I thought the price was pretty decent and the portion size was good. I work out a lot and am always hungry, but I felt satisfied with one full-sized burrito (for lunch, at least).

One waitress was handling the entire restaurant on the night of our visit; it was not busy, but nonetheless she had the situation well paced and under control.  

Even though it was below freezing outside and a perfect night for a cup of steaming hot soup, I ordered the cold fruit soup.  This soup was sweet with a bit of spice (nutmeg?) and could have worked just as well for dessert.  That is not a complaint, just an observation!  The soup was tasty.  My friends had the chicken dumpling soup and the hot borscht.  They thought the soups were ok.  

I also had the cheese and potato pierogies, an appetizer, 3 for $6.50.  They were deep fried, which is not my favorite way of preparing pierogies.  It would have been nice to have a choice of how they were prepared.  And, although they were handmade and one of the Warsaw Café's specialties, I personally thought that the frying may have cancelled out what makes them so special.  I didn't really enjoy them that much.  And, for $6.50, I thought the price was on the upper end for a modest portion.

Around Xmas time I was having a party, and I wanted to serve seitan joes, but when I realized how much time and effort I didn't have that the seitan would require, I called Essene and asked if they offered a tofu meatball that I could serve in a crock pot.  Well, just that day, they were receiving a small shipment of 6 boxes of Mama Bella's meatballs that were very popular and in demand considering how unoften they have them available.  A nice lady put it in as an order for me so they would hold them.  They weren't cheap at around $4.30 for 4?... but the few vegans at my party loved them.

It consists of their homemade egg noodles, with shredded chicken, mushroom, barbeque pork (char sui), boiled egg, vegetable, 2 fried wontons, and a meat ball and fish ball served in a separate bowl of chicken broth. it's a lot of food and you get it all for $6.50!!!

I wish I knew about this place earlier, but I will definitely have to stop down here every time I am in Philly :D.


Pros:
- Relatively inexpensive....most plates go for around $6
- Home-made egg noodles!! You can definitely taste the difference!
- Huge portions! Made me feel really full for a loooong time (I ate at 2pm and I didn't really eat dinner that day)


Cons:
- Parking is a little tough...you either have to back-in and park or parallel park, but there are a ton of spaces around

This was my second visit since I have been in Philadelphia and couldn't remember if I liked it or not the last time I was here. Well that was the answer: so-so. I had a lunch special and was very disappointed with the amount of food provided for an almost $10 kabob dish. There were literally 5 bites of meat, with some rice, a small salad and some bread. The meat and the rice tasted great, but geez, I'm not a bird. 

I also decided to try the ""Special yogurt drink"" thinking it might be similar to an Indian Lassi. Boy, was I wrong. That thing tasted like salty, sour ass. I could only drink a few sips of it and was completely repulsed. I tried to salvage it by adding 5 (!) packets of Splenda to maybe sweeten it up - didn't work and still tasted foul. I ended up pouring it down the drain. I bet that stuff works better than bleach in clearing it out. 

Also, this restaurant is subterranean and the small dining area has no windows, so it feels like you are in a closet.

For years, when I go from Jersey to Philly I always made it a point to stop by to find some rare bottles or just breweries that do not distribute outside of Philly.  Last night a few of us had a great dinner in Philly (we drank Petrus Pale, Sixpoint Resin, Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA, New Holland Dragon's Milk Imp Stout).  The friends I went with have really been getting into learning about beers and trying new styles and breweries.  We drove over to the Foodery and my friend's wife joined me in the store.  She was looking for Imp Stouts/RIS/Barrel Aged stuff and wanted to get her husband some Double IPAs.  We looked around and I gave her advice as to which bottles she would like, which were rare and pricey, and which ones she could get in NJ near her home.  She had great questions and we were having a good time.  

What happens next, the guy behind the counter starts mocking us!!!  Seriously!  She was asking me where certain breweries were located and where she could purchase them.  The guy behind the counter (white guy, short black hair, little preppy in a disheveled way), in a pompous, condescending voice started saying to a friend sitting behind the counter, ""Well I know about beer.  I'm the smartest.  This beer is from Maryland, and it is wonderful.  This one you can only get in Philly.  This one is perfect, you need to get it.  Beer, beer, beer, I know everything about beer.""  This went on for almost a minute and we just ignored it.  Why?  Why did he need to be such a D-bag!  Why mock customers.  Then when we went to the counter to pay he was acting like such an arse!  He kept looking at the credit card and referring to my friend by her first name, not hitting on her, but acting goofy like he had more than a beer or three in his belly.  Not to mention it took him more than a few minutes to process the purchase and ring us up because he kept messing up.

This is just rude, obnoxious and bad customer service.  We had such a good night until the service at a bottle shop ruined it.  My friend was very excited to be introduced to this shop as we got there, but now will never set foot in there again.  She is usually very mild mannered, but after we left she even said she wanted to give the guy a d-ck punch.  And I have never heard her use profanity that way before.

We ordered a few plates and shared for an hour long frenzy of lip-smacking, pita-dipping, appreciative-groaning good times.

The Grilled Octopus- VERY generous portion for $12. Whatever it was marinated in was so so tasty. The meat may have been slightly overcooked as it was a bit chewy, but my dear Dmitri's veteran friend assured us that it is usually more succulent. Still delicious.

The Shrimp Scampi- Ahhhh! Scary good. This was my favorite of everything we sampled. After the shrimp was gone, the extra oil/sauce was quickly obliterated by pita bread.

The Fried Scallops- HUGE scallops! So silky, juicy, lightly fried. Just delicious.

Chicken Kabob- Yummy yummy, juicy chunks of chicken that I unceremoniously slathered in tzatziki. Mmm, so much dill.

The service was great as well. Our waitress was friendly and prompt. She immediately corked our wine and asked if we'd like our bottle of white to be kept in the fridge. By the time we finished it was almost closing time, so she sent us away with a few loaves of bread. Ace!

My sister recommended the spicy, crunchy cucumbers while we waited for the two entrees to come out: black bean chicken and hot sauce style chicken.

Spicy, Crunch Cucumbers | At first glance, it looked like cucumbers in liquid so I didn't think it would be crunch. I was wrong. The sauce with hints of vinegar and soy permeated the outer layer of the cucumber leaving the inside nice and crunchy. It was tasty yet refreshing.

Black Bean Chicken | I had never had a sauce based on black beans and it seemed like it would have been too thick. The sauce was light and as a great medium to bring out the other spices without it being overwhelming the chicken. It was sauteed in with some chunky onion and bell pepper pieces. Huge fan!

Hot Sauce Style | You have your options of eight different concentrations (Chicken, Pork, Beef, Lamb, Fish, Shrimp, Scallops and Fried Tofu). We went with the sliced pieces of chicken stir fried with cabbage, garlic and celery in a szechuan chili oil-based hot sauce. Although the menu notes it as spicy, the dish was not spicy. The chili oil sauce was nice and thick and paired well with the white, sticky rice they provided us.  You can taste the use of garlic however it wasn't overwhelming with the hot chili taste.

This place is great.  I think I've eaten at least one billion times here, and I never get sick of it.  

First of all, how can you go wrong with beer, wine, and cheese?  Especially during Sunday School when they feature one of each for half off the selling price?  Sunday just got a little more fun.

Also, not only is their wine selection great, but they also have a ton of tasty beers as well.  My only wish is that they would change up the wine list now and then..

They also have a lot of great things to munch on.

-double cooked pork belly

After a trip to the Camden aquarium we wanted to try some of South Philly's famed Italian food. 

The highlight of the meal was the Pollo saltimbocca which had a delicious home made flavor, good portion size and tasty mushrooms. 

Penne vodka was a bit of a letdown by comparison. It's hard to explain but the taste wasn't as good as I've had at other restaurants. It tasted home made but not in a good way, unlike the chicken dish. 

The mussels and clams appetizer in spicy red sauce was another high point. The clams and mussels were small but tasted fresh and the sauce was great enough to want to keep dipping bread into. 

We also had the house salad... twice. The first time it came it was a bit too drenched in salad dressing. This would have been fine if the dressing weren't so salty - the ample amount of black olives didn't help with that either. Second time around we asked for the dressing on the side. 

Atmosphere and decor was a bit dated though warm. It got very busy as we were eating, which is a good sign. 

One weird thing I noticed was that tilapia is the only fish on the regular menu (though they did have a bronzini in the specials). Given how tilapia is not exactly known for its health benefits they would do well to offer health conscious customers better fish dish selections.

(My friend and I were super lucky because the fries were half off! Of course, we ordered two plates because America.) Where do I even start? The pork roll burger was just everything you wanted and more. The moment you bite into that burger and break the yolk is just glorious. The duck fries were tossed in duck fat and seasoned really well. Fries were topped off with melted Gouda goodness, shredded duck, and chives. I've never had Gouda in my life and I'm glad I got to share this beautiful moment with The Blue Duck. 

I've only been to brunch here about two times and both times were amazing. First time I came for brunch I had the chicken and waffles. I read the menu and saw that chicken breast was soaked in buttermilk Sriracha. Basically, that is what sold me and it was a great choice. Second time I came around I ordered a special which was short-rib tater tots. Let me tell you, I am a potato fiend and these were the best damn tots I ever did have. Perfect crisp. Oh, and did I mention these tots were drizzled with Gouda? A+

Best way to know the specials is to follow their Instagram and if you're coming on a weekend definitely make a reservation to be on the safe side.

It's located in the heart of Old City so be sure to plan for parking. I found a spot about a block away on a Saturday night - which honestly isn't bad considering how crowded it gets around the area. 

The place has a southern saloon vibe, and drinks to match. Entering in, there's a main bar area that takes up most of the space, and then there is seating scattered throughout the outskirts. In the summer months, there is also outdoor seating available with heated lamps and good people watching haha. 

Getting the bartenders attention to order drinks was probably the biggest gripe. My guest and I peered the drinks menu and opted for a wine and a mule. The bar was pretty packed when we first arrived and I sort of felt that I was interrupting a private party.

For a busy night, they only had two bartenders (and it spans a large space) - I think another hand would've helped keep things moving better.

I know sushi snobs are usually afraid of places with good deals and that are not Japanese-owned, but we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the fish, and their rolls were also more than adequate. 

When we ordered through Grub Hub, the menu options were a little different from the menu we were given in the restaurant. The sashimi combo available through Grub Hub turned out to be a better deal. In house I was able to get 12 pieces for 18 dollars, which is already a great deal for really fresh fish, but he also gave me double sets of salmon. I didn't mind it but I can certainly appreciate greater variety. Through Grub Hub I got a sashimi combo for 19 dollars that came with a big thing of miso and 15 pieces of fish. The size of the cuts are not all equal. The tuna was about half the size of the buttermilk fish, but overall I had a very satisfying-- big and fresh, meal.

The Boy always goes for the 3 roll special, and so far we have tried the alaska roll, eel cucumber, lobster avocado, philadelphia, salmon, and spicy tuna.

Boy have things changed over the last year. The menu is now toned down to a couple of small plates, tacos, tortas and about 4 large plates. The margaritas are still excellent but unfortunately loaded with ice and good for about four large sips.

Sadly we were presented with a large dish of chips with a scoop of guacamole that was heavy on lime. Ok with drinks, but no comparison to the predecessor. Tuna Ceviche followed with a grey oddly textured mound of tuna. I really did not like this dish (something was amuck) Of the three appetizers we ordered, the lamb tamale was easily the best. Rich lamb enveloped in a very nice casing of masa.

For entrees, I had the pork cheek tacos that were braised in beer and served with a walnut mole.

I knew this was a swanky place, but the cost of parking per night is absolutely appalling. It cost me $91. I was only there for two nights. Ridiculous. 

But other than that, I had a glorious time!

I was greeted by a lovely front desk attendant. She checked me in, and then escorted me to the concierge when I had asked about what was fun to do in the area, since I had never been to Philadelphia before. The concierge told me about several places I might enjoy, and even gave me a list of addresses and a map of the city. 

My room was simply stunning. The view from the 22nd floor was incredible. I almost decided to stay at a more affordable hotel a little further out, but it was soooo worth the extra money to be able to wake up to Philadelphia like that every morning. My room even had one of those things you can hook your iPhone or iPod up to and play music. So of course, I danced around my room while getting ready both nights!

I had dinner both nights downstairs at the Bank and Bourbon Restaurant. I sat at the bar because it was pretty slow (it was Easter Sunday the first night). Great bartenders, very cool and knowledgeable on all the different drinks and even the menu. I even made a couple new friends! 

Everyone from the concierge to the bellman to the housekeepers were so nice. I had an amazing experience at this hotel, and I will always stay here when I visit Philly.

I can't say that I LOVE Honey's but it's a nice place if you are real hungry cause the portions are substantial for even the hungriest of humans.

I'm basing this off of the breakfast bomb. It tasted good, but I could not stop comparing it to an upscale Mcdonald's McGriddle.

I previously purchased the $15 for $30 groupon and decided today was the fateful day to use it.  Arrived at La Creperie around 2:00pm only to find it empty save for two or three tables.  Come to think of it, every time I've walked by this place or eaten here, no matter what time of day, it's EMPTY.  Dying restaurant?  Perhaps.

In defense of La Creperie and in disagreement with previous reviews, service was fine.  Guess it's hit or miss.  Our crepes came out fairly quick.  I had the La Gitane--bacon, some kind of cheese, onion, and herb de provence--and my gf had one with mushrooms, ham, some kind of cheese.  I can't remember exactly what we got simply because it wasn't memorable.  It was good, just nice, simple, and flavorful.  However, for what it was, I think the price points are too high.  At the end of the meal I was satisfied, but maybe even still a slight bit hungry?  In comparison, go to the crepe place on Penn's campus and you get a monster sized crepe for $7.  Granted, it isn't as tasty and delicate, but it serves me TWO meals, a feat that should not go without praise.  So is 75% of a meal worth twice the price of a meal worth 200% stomach full-ness?  Everyone still with me?  haha.

Unfortunately, the answer is no.  The price is just above the line of what I'd be willing to pay given quality and size.  So is that what keeps La Creperie empty?  I think that's part of it.  The reasons why I give this place three stars ends here, but I will offer up my opinion on what other factors might be making this a less than appealing dining spot given its populated center city location.

1.  I'd rather go here on a cold rainy day than a warm and sunny.  It's sooo stuffy in there, the windows don't open, and air circulation is poor.  I feel like a caged animal in there when the weather is nice.

2.  Location.  Sansom street has a lot of hidden gems on it, but I don't think it gets the walking traffic that it deserves.

3.  Decor.  The tables will rock back and forth with the slightest touch of an arm.  My girlfriend commented that she felt she was in the Caribbean, not France.

4.  The double edged sword - I think when people see an empty restaurant, they wonder what's wrong with it.  And they will skip over it.

In conclusion, if you read this essay on La Creperie, bravo.  I hope you find it useful.  All things considered, this place is the definition of mediocre.",2011-04-03 19:59:09,
