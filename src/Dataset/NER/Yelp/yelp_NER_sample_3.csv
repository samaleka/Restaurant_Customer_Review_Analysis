From the minute you walk down the tiny street to ring the doorbell to be let in until you walk out so full and wondering what just happened?!  There are no options for a smaller dinner than a 7course meal. There is no menu but you do get to pick between two choices for the two entree courses. There is also no direction as to whether you can take home leftovers (we yelped to find out we could but only after the 5th course), to how much it will cost you ($34/pp w/o alcohol & tip was already included), and to how you can pay. They only take cash. So if you know all this going in you can be prepared. The food and service were otherwise excellent.

The lighting always seems oddly low, not inviting and cozy, more like ""we're saving electricity"" and want to appear closed. Zero for atmosphere in the evenings... My last time there, after heading in and standing w/ my friend , front and center, waiting to be seated in the 1/4 filled restaurant, we waited easily 10-15 minutes for attention of any kind. The waiters mostly hung out by the bar and in the recesses of the restaurant, slouching and gabbing, w/ not a glance at us obviously waiting....finally, let's call him ""Mr.Hunky"", deigned to come up and and said ""Yo, what's up?"". I thought this was a restaurant, not a singles bar from the 70's?
""Mr.Hunky"" had passed us a couple times previously but seemed unable to multitask and  seat us at any of the plentiful open tables, too busy to rush back and hang with his posse....I was amazed and said we were waiting to be seated (duh)....but we decided to exit and eat at Jones round the corner where they welcome diners. 

I've been previously underwhelmed, overall, by the food here and at other Marathons. The  new menu seems to have carved down portions on practically everything.  The burgers are the safest bet, but you may as well not bother ordering it to taste, because it's never right. They also got rid of the one thing that was superb on their menu; the Salmon Nicoise Salad. That was my only reason for going there....that and the faint hope that ""Mr Hunky"" might suddenly realize his true calling and, possibly, only talent and do a spontaneous table dance, for the very first time truly earning his dollar bills!

My favorites from the sweets are the carrot cakes, macaroons, and chocolate chip cookies.  On the savory side, their breakfast pockets are excellent.  They also serve above average pizza but it's overpriced and tends to be too salty in my opinion.

The only wholly negative experiences I've had with the place are the occasional rude employees.  For example, the place takes delivery orders, and once an employee actually had the gall to tell me to hurry up and that he didn't have all day while I was placing an order over the phone (how rude!).  And sometimes they're a bit reluctant to elaborate and describe items when deliberating between the vast array of treats they offer.  I feel they should help because the item names are generally not indicative of what they are so the employees should help you understand what you're buying.

2. In addition to their amazing and fresh produce, my favorite part about Ippolito's is the menu. SUCH a great variety of delicious seafood;

*The shrimp roll is amazing. A toasty brioche bun filled--and I mean FILLED, they don't joke around--with delicious fresh shrimp that POP in your mouth with every bite.

The salmon burger is off the hook, too + the best of Philly (their famous crab cake sandwich).

The 50's diner vibe, the ridiculous milkshakes and egg creams, the name, and of course the steaks. They are cooked to order, not an assembly line deal like Jim's or Pat's. This of course means they can give a lot more attention to the steak and it shows. The onions are perfectly caramelized, the flavorful steak chopped just enough, the roll is fresh and toasty, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and if you get american or provolone the cheese is actually melted properly and MIXED IN WITH THE MEAT; something that is crucial in my opinion if you are not going with wiz yet also something that is so often overlooked. The large steak is a full 12 inches I believe, and starts at just under 8 dollars which is already a great value. But Chinks has one more trick up their sleeve, their daily specials, which run from combo deals tuesday and thursday, to 6.50 large cheeseteaks all day on wednesdays, which is an incredible deal.

Their kitchen is open late, which is a big plus for me. I've eaten here after 11 on a Wednesday night, so they must serve food until at least 12 on weeknights. Big fan.

We went on a Thursday night thinking around 6:30 pm thinking that we would beat the rush, we were wrong. We didn't make a reservation so we ended up waiting for a table for about 15 minutes. The whole time we were there people were waiting so it might be best to make a reservation in the future. After eating here I am can see why it's so busy, the food is outstanding and pretty much everything that can be made in house is from the burgers, the pasta, to the turkey meatballs. We went a little crazy on the food size and took some leftovers home but we started off with the grilled caesar salad which was awesome, especially the cornbread croutons. We also did the General Tso's wings which were huge and a full order is 12 for $11 and it comes with wasabi blue cheese which is awesome. For dinner we did the special pasta of the day which came with turkey meatballs, the pasta was awesome and you can definitely tell it's fresh and housemade and the same with the meatballs, they were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. We also got the Pork Roll burger which is the one that won Serviss the Philly Burger competition and man it's awesome, some serious pork flavor there and the special sauce is great as well. Also got some Blue Duck Fries which are just gluttonous and amazing, fries tossed in duck fat, topped with confit duck, and then topped again with cheese sauce. We did somehow manage to save enough room for dessert which was cheesecake that came in a little jar. It was awesome as well, not overly heavy and rich, it was the perfect way to end the meal.

the bar is pretty low key, rarely very full, and a decent place to bring friends or a date. the noise level is acceptable with a great jukebox and, in the few times i've been there, douchebros have been minimally invasive. there was one night that some guy was trying to read a book and some dudes were being total assholes right behind him. i mean, it is a bar, so i don't know why anyone would be trying to read there, but these guys were exceptionally annoying. that was an isolated incident, though.

now, i didn't drink beer regularly until a few months ago (i don't really like any of the shitty beers that typically populate college parties, so i'd usually just try and get drunk off of vodka or gin), so i don't know how qualified i am to judge the beer selection. from what i've seen at other bars, prohibition's beer list isn't super extensive, but there's a good variety of beers both on tap and in bottles. the bartenders are nice, attentive, cool folks who know what they're talking about way more than i do.

now, the food is nothing out of the ordinary, but damn it's good. i don't like green beans so i haven't had those beer battered things everyone's having conniptions over. the polenta fries are absolutely perfect: spicy, salty, fried crispy on the outside and velvety on the inside. the aioli that comes along with it makes me want to cry just thinking about how FUCKING GOOD it is. the wings are banging, too: good size, tender meat, extra saucy and a 4/5 on the heat level. i had a burger once, and it was decent, but i won't be having it again.

it's very reasonably priced with most beers on tap being 5 or so dollars. the food is a little more expensive than usual for bar food, but definitely worth it.

Surfing a sea of laptops
Dogs, dads and strollers

La.Va is one of those places I love and loathe at the same time. More on that momentarily.

Generally I'm a huge fan of La.Va. It's close to my apartment (two blocks), and a large coffee comes in at an even $2. I buy coffee often, and I cringe every time something is run up at $1.97 or something ridiculous. It's nice knowing that I'm not going to be walking around with a pocket full of change. The opening staff is super friendly most of the time, and if you're looking for a peaceful early morning haunt to read the paper before work, this is it. There's a $10 minimum on credit cards; I just get a gift card with a couple weeks worth of funds on it and call it a day.

The food is decent, with a few selections of sandwiches and heavier dinner items. It's a strange menu for a coffee shop, but there's definitely something to eat if you're hungry, and if you eat in you'll get a salad and some pickles on the side for naught but a smile.

It would be great if they had a larger selection of baked goods, perhaps a danish other than apple, but the I suspect I would always go back to the chocolate croissant anyway. Their bagels are great, and the bacon egg and cheese is kind of the best thing on the menu. Huge slab of ham, lots of egg with the cheese stuffed inside. I don't get it often enough and am hungry thinking about it.

The loathing aspect? There are approximately  20 tables in the whole place, covered by a grand total of two outlets, and no power strips or other accommodations. Maybe it's smart business (when the laptop juice runs out, you should probably leave anyway,) but it's annoying if you want to get on the comp and can't grab a plug. Accompanied with this is the almost non-existence of available seating anytime from 2 pm to close  (at 9.) The laptop surfers descend in droves and are relentless in their occupation of every habitable surface.

This is such a nitpicky complaint but such a regular occurrence that it's annoying: their to-go cups leak. Not from the bottom, but the lid and top have some sort of mis-connect and the lid leaks by the seam every single time. To be quite honest it's the chief annoyance of my morning.",2010-10-06 13:33:23,"{'food': ['sandwiches', 'dinner items'], 'drink': ['coffee']}"

This is thanks completely to the *servers, bartenders, and kitchen staff*. On Valentine's Day, however, we had a very different experience. I am confident that the servers and kitchen staff were amazing as always, but we never found out. We made our reservation about a month and a half early, to ensure a window seat. OpenTable asked for a credit card when booking--no problem; we provided it. Upon arrival, we were told that, since we did not place a deposit, there was not a table for us. Yes, they could see our reservation in the system, they said; they can see the date on which we placed the reservation, a month and a half prior. However, they claim to have called us (one time) to get a deposit from us, and since they were unsuccessful, they didn't hold us a table (again, they can see our reservation, they knew we were coming).  **No one had ever called to obtain a deposit from us.**  Further, had they needed a deposit, that should have been worked out between OpenTable and R2L--not our problem. OpenTable asked for a credit card and we provided one. Plus, how incredibly rude is it to require a deposit for a table reservation anyway? As a semi-regular at this place I find that greatly offensive. We weren't speaking with hourly-waged youngsters either; we started with a manager and were escalated to ""one of the owners"". Neither woman made an attempt to be friendly, let alone apologetic or accommodating in any way.  This lady who was ""one of the owners"" should definitely keep herself exclusively in the back of the house, away from any sort of paying customer.  I have never, as a customer, been treated so poorly or talked to so terribly. And, no, I can assure you, we were not out of line or yelling or making a scene or rude for our part; we just aren't the type. She was plain awful.  Never so much as a shred of an inkling of a hint of an apology or any effort whatsoever.  So, despite all of the rave verbal reviews I have given everyone I know about this place in the past, I will now make sure that everyone we know, meet, work with, or do business with--several of whom work in that building--does not ever drink or dine at R2L.

I have eaten in famous restaurants all over the world, and this one is right up there with any of them.  I will admit that if you are looking for a ""scene"" or a ""trendy atmosphere"", this restaurant is not for you.  However, having said that, I will say that there is no other restaurant in Philadelphia that produces food that is as interesting, fresh, and delicious as Marc Vetri's.  The service is impeccable, the menu ever-changing, and the preparations fascinatingly nuanced.

I went there tonight for my tenth time.  I took a few friends out for a celebratory dinner.  We ate their famous charcuterie plate, a special preparation of nantucket bay scallops, pig's foot ravioli, pork belly papardelle, spinach gnocci, shoulder of baby goat, salt-cured branzino, a cheese plate, lavender gelato, and chocolate souffle.  We ordered ""family style"" and enjoyed every single bite.  In fact, we ordered ""seconds"" of the papardelle and scallops because they were so delicious.

Some advice before dining at this restaurant.  First, eat family style.  It is the best way to taste as much as possible of the diverse menu.  Second, let them help you choose the wine.  The employees of this restaurant are well-versed in the nuances of their wine selections and will help you find a reasonably priced bottle that pairs well with your menu choices and preferences.  Third, when you eat here, ""go all out"".  That means, get ready to eat a lot, and prepare to enjoy yourself thoroughly.  This is a restaurant tailored for those who enjoy a cozy, comfortable atmosphere, nice people, and good food.  Again, if you are looking for a trendy restaurant, go to Morimoto.  The food won't be NEARLY as good, but you'll find all of the wannabe hipsters you can handle.

I know this is a strong review, but I believe every word of it.  There are a lot of excellent restaurants in Philadelphia that may enjoy more ""street cred"" (think Le Bec Fin, Morimoto, Buddhakan, etc.), but certainly do not deserve it.  This restaurant is absolutely terrific, and if you walk in with an open mind (and granted, an open wallet), you will absolutely enjoy it as much as I do.

Enjoy.  This will be one of your better dining experiences, anywhere.

First off the concept is great. Small plate style southern food, whom would have ever thought that up? Its amazing to watch a master at work. Seeing fine dining's take on classic southern fare is pretty fun. We started with a few cocktails which were pretty delicious; a blackberry mint julep for me and I cant remember what she ordered but it was better than mine.

We decided to order a bunch of different things, starting with the Southern Hummus and fried green tomatoes. Love the fried green tomatoes. Piping hot, nice sauce, awesome exterior crunch. Hummus was just ok. I loved the bread it came with, but the hummus didnt have much pop to it. If i didnt know it was made from peanuts, I never could have guessed.

Next up were the Shrimp & Grits and mac and cheese. Shrimp and grits fell flat for me. Grits were good, but shrimp lacked seasoning. Definitely needs more flavor to not be lost in the richness of the grits. Mac and cheese was awesome. Loved the potato chip crust on top. Textural difference is awesome.

Hot chicken and collard greens came next. Booyah that chicken is freaking tasty. Spicy, but not overly so, juicy tender chicken with a hell of a crunch. The white bread and ranch really brought it up another level though. The ranch was incredible. I had no idea that collard greens could taste so good. My first time having them and all I have to say is wow. Loved the flavor and the nice chunks of ham hocks dispersed throughout. Awesome combination

Dessert time and although they didnt have espresso which normally makes me mad, their coffee is delicious. Our server told us how good it was and he was right. The cookie skillet is simply bangin. Only thing I wish is that the scoop of ice cream on top was a touch bigger. it was hard to spread it out enough to get some with every bite. The cookie is incredible rich and decadent. Loved the banana pudding too. Awesome take on it. Crispy nilla waferesque cookie and creamy banana pudding. Homerun. Always nice to see Ben taking care of people too.

My boyfriend felt the Whiskey King was the sure winner. There was a lot more texture going on with the crispiness of the bacon and the creaminess of the cheese etc. He felt the Black Label was too monotone.

I, on the other hand felt the Black Label won out. Yeah, I dug all the texture going on with the Whiskey King, but I felt the flavor of the meat on the Black Label was far too superior than the Whiskey. Not only that, it's just a better deal. $26 at Minetta gives you a delicious burger with a side of exceptional fries. $26 at Village, just gives you a burger. Fries are extra. 

Ok, ok, I know what you're gonna say next. You get a slab of foie gras on the Village Whiskey burger! Yes you do, but what's the point if it gets over powered by the flavor of the burger and bacon and blue cheese...

Foie gras just doesn't belong on a burger. It needs to be enjoyed on it's own.

Alright, enough about the burger. What about everything else?

Village Whiskey doesn't take reservation, but that's because the place is small! When we got there, there was a 45 minute wait, which we were ok with. They take your name and cellphone number and actually send you a txt message when your table is ready, so you can leave and wander around the surrounding area while you wait for your table. When you're table is ready, they will hold it for 15 minute, so you don't have to make a mad rush to get back. I thought this was pretty cool.

I was in the mood for trying one of their shakes, so we decided on the Irish Car Bomb. It was smooth and creamy and the piece of frosted chocolate cake garnish was exceptional. If I wasn't so full after my meal, I would have gotten more of that cake for dessert!

We also got an order of truffled cauliflower pickles as an appetizer and shared and order of duck fat fries to go with our burgers. 

The pickles were great. The right amount of sweet and sour. It was accompanied with bread, butter and an olive tapenade.

Just as I sat down in my office I received a call saying that I had been waitlisted at the original place I had planned on going for my big 3 2 so now I was scrambling. 

I'd been wanting to come to FH since reading about the hot chicken in Foobooz about 9 or 10 months ago. Now I don't typically travel in to UC but when I do it's typically on a food endeavor and what better food to travel for than fried chicken. So me, my brother, and my wife, all piled into mom's Prius on our quest to southern cooked glory. 

Upon arrival I was surprised by how small the place was but the setup was nice and there was plenty of space between the tables. We were sat right away and our waiter came over and explained the drink menu. The cocktails are for the most part a Southern twist on the classics. I had a gin drink with Earl Grey tea and lemon. It was good but I only really ordered it so my mother wouldn't realize I was too hungover to comfortably drink. 

We inspected the menu as a group and decided to get the majority of the bottom 2 sections of the menu as an appetizer. The mac and cheese was good, the beets were really tasty but oyster sliders were far and away one of the best things I've tasted possibly ever. Definitely in the top 10. The issue I usually have with sliders is overbearing bread taking away from the innards and I sort of expected the same to happen here especially with a fried oyster. Not at all. The oyster was large enough to hold its own and the little bun was so fresh and soft it melted with each bite. 

I ordered the hot chicken of course but by the time it came I was full on the verge of being too full. This is my shame to bear. I ate it and I certainly enjoyed it but I know it could have been so much more for me. It was cooked to perfection and once it was cool enough to eat I recognized that this was a dish I could get messy for had I not stuffed myself prior. 

I made a vow to myself to return hungry and only have the sliders and the chicken.

Walked in the restaurant to place a take out order for two pho dishes. Paid by card & left a 4$ tip on a 22$ takeout order. 

As they gave me the food i asked if i could have hot sauce as well and was told by the young man that thats 1$ extra... i had no cash only card but i was surprised because i was just there yesterday cus my bf is sick and picked up an order with the hot sauce without having to pay anything for it. The older man yesterday was super friendly to me and said if i ever need sauce to just ask so i was baffled that now i had to pay for it. Additionally this is the same sauce that is sitting on the table. I didn't ask for extra sauce! I let the young man know that if he wanted to charge me a $1 to go ahead but i had gotten it for free before to which he replied the rules have changed. And when i said that was yesterday he mumbled and walked away and begrudgingly filled a container for me and as he handed it said next time its a 1$... 

Why do i have to pay extra to get the same sauce sitting on the table which i got for free the other day. Secondly i tipped u $4 on takeout. Ive worked in the business. People rarely tip for pickup so you still have the nerve to be a dick... I walked away with the food pissed off that this really just happened. and he had the nerve to yell nothing is free as i was walking away. All this commotion occurred with customers in the store.  Great customer service! 

Oh and when i get home only one bag of toppings was provided for two orders, with only 1 lime wedge to be shared by two people...

To account for small portions and exorbitant prices they say that they're ""tapas"" style. It's literally just an excuse to charge a lot for small portions of basic food. As a Philadelphia ""Southern"" restaurant I was somewhat disgruntled by their adoption of Spanish tapas style. 

Anyway, I came here with a friend on a Friday and we ordered the skillet cornbread (8), oyster slider (6 each), mac and cheese (8), and hot chicken (15). It came out to about 50 dollars with tax and tip, which I found ridiculous for the amount and type of food  (we were both still hungry after). 

Cornbread: The cornbread looks a lot bigger in the pictures than it actually is. It's about 3x4 inches, or about the size of an iphone 6. I get paying a lot for appetizers when there are a lot of fresh ingredients or it takes a lot of prep time, but this is literally a piece of cornbread....8 dollars for mixing margarine, cornmeal, eggs, a few other dry ingredients (probably in bulk), and then throwing it in the oven. 

Oyster Slider: Crispy fried oysters with slaw. It was good, but again, tiny as hell. You'll eat it in two bites. 

Mac and Cheese: For a southern place it was way below par (...also, wait for it.....incredibly small). Under-salted and underwhelming 

Hot Chicken: Two pieces of spicy chicken on ranch, cucumber, and white bread (just straight up square white bread from the store). The chicken was pretty good but nothing to run over there for.

The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good. 

Not at all true....

To start with, we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home, and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right, but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big, we each only finished two tacos! 

The most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito, that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different.

The furniture could definitely use a bit of an update, but the music was very modern and relaxing - think Ingrid Michaelson meets Air. The star dishes here were definitely the escargots appetizer - in the most delectable savory mushroom sauce - the salmon entree (wrapped in phyllo dough and served with a cauliflower mouse, and a scrumptious morsel of ratatouille inside a sweetly carved zucchini), and the profiteroles for dessert -- made with the fluffiest pastry, and the perfect balance of sweet dripping chocolate and thick milky ice cream. The staff was very friendly knowledgeable about the wine, the menu, and the history of the building - and big points have to go to our server, Jason, who made excellent recommendations.

You might have missed this place walking by it. The restaurant has only 35 seats, a very cozy atmosphere as you would find in typical Italian restaurants. Buon Ricordo (good memory) ceramic plates on the wall remind you that this chef travels to Italy often to further immerse himself in food.

The menu is updated weekly and changes with the season. They also offer 6 and 8 course tasting menus during the summer. We called just a day before our visit (they book 2 months ahead) we were very lucky to get in! The chef and staff were so welcoming and treated us like royalty! Here's what we ate:

Antipasti - huge antipasto round with lots of yummy grilled, marinated vegetables, smoky cheeses, mixed greens with grana, and freshly sliced ethereal slices of prosciutto done a la minute and brought to our table. We also ordered the Crisp Suckling Pig with Roasted Corn antipasto that was so delicious! The chef also sent out the Foie Gras Pastrami with Cherry Mostarda (the foie gras is ""cured"" like pastrami - this was such an amazing dish!).

For pastas, we ordered the Mint Pappardelle with Lamb and Sweet Pea Ragu and the signature Spinach Gnocchi with Shaved Ricotta and Brown Butter. Lots of butter in the gnocchi sauce! The gnocchi were almost entirely made of spinach - and just so light and delicate. The chef also sent out a taste of the not-on-the-menu corn ravioli with shaved black summer truffles from italy. Divine!

We decided to share the main course  - another signature: Roasted Capretto (baby goat) with Soft Polenta - it was out of this world! Chef Marc Vetri presented each dish to us, and this was especially incredible - they roast the goat outdoors for hours. It was so tender!

SERVICE
...was amazing. It was like one of those Hindu goddesses was bringing all the dishes, whisking them away when done, and a constant flow of deliciousness on our table. We were seated near Ben, the Manager, who was very helpful in giving advice about what to order. He must have also been entertained by our having memorized the menu, or me obnoxiously taking pictures and (surprise!) decided to send out a few extra dishes (BEST NIGHT EVER).

FOOD
-Full disclosure-I'm not a huge huge fan of Southern food, but I'm a fan of good food. This was all good. Here are the highlights:
-Charcuterie plate-the chicken liver was the standout food of the night (even to my friend the diehard liver hater).
-The Carolina Gold Rice was the dark horse winner of our affections. Get it.
-Hummus-smooth with a delicious peanuty aftertaste.
-The Hot Chicken came highly recommended and although delicious-was a bit too spicy for me to enjoy without needing water to breathe. (Like Handy Nasty level 8 spicy).
-Pork Belly and Pulled Pork-both delicious and would recommend ordering.
-Mustard Greens and Roasted Root Veggies- very good, and nice to have something fresh on the table.

DRANKS
- The Fat Apple was delicious but barely tasted boozy-good thing? dangerous thing? 
-The Blackberry cocktail was VERY strong. but very good.
-Large selection of whiskey and beers. Reasonably priced for what you're getting, but watch out if you're ordering more than one cocktail, at $10 a piece they could easily double your bill.

They always love it even if they're not into burgers! Gotta say this place never ceases to please. Their whole look and feel and belief system is awesome. 

They're big on recycling, so all their locations are made up of old torn down barn parts, including the tin ceiling tiles, the chairs, tables, most of the decorations, etc. I love their take out menu. It's pocket-sized and really cute with a great selection of items that are all made to order. It's a little harder to follow that their dine-in menu but even their dine-in menu can be a bit overwhelming to follow. My favorite topping is the chickpea onions: its just shoestring onions dipped in a chickpea batter and fried to a crisp. Goes great on any burger! The appetizers are really pricey and are only really worth it if there's a bunch of people eating. Good for groups. The pickle and slaw appetizer is a good one to share. The sweet potato fries and other side items are just enough.

My favorite server there is Heaven who always knows just what to recommend and is very charming in her presence. My friends love having her wait on us.

I ordered the chicken and waffles while my boyfriend ordered his staple breakfast burrito. Upon first glance I was super confused. No syrup, a roasted chicken leg over cornbread waffles with a combination of avocado and tomato salsa on top? I had a feeling I was in for disappointment. Apprehensively, I took the first bite of chicken and waffle.

Holy crap. All I could wonder was how the hell they did this!

The chicken was the juiciest most succulent meat I've ever tasted. The dark meat was roasted to perfection and literally was falling off the bone. The cornbread waffle was flaky and full of flavor reminiscent of my Southern Grammy's cornbread muffins. The avocado tomato paste was surprisingly a perfect complement to the spice rub on the chicken leg and paired with the waffle perfectly. Syrup would have been an abomination to that meal.

I begrudgingly shared my dish with my boyfriend who quickly lamented not ordering the same meal. I'm the queen of taking home leftovers but not on that day. I would have licked the damn plate if I wasn't in public.

They also sell hand-cut fries (which I find are a tad bit overly salted) that you can purchase additional dips for, like Peppercorn Ranch, Rosemary Aioli, or Chimichurri Sauce.

English muffin that was twice as big as what was on top of it, a tablespoon of shredded salmon with wilted spinach, and the sorriest excuse for hollandaise sauce I have ever seen.

Die chinesische Küche ist nicht auf Platz 1 meiner Heißhunger-Favoriten, aber hin und wieder lasse ich mich dann doch dazu hinreißen.
Das Restaurant ist groß, und auffällig war direkt, dass die Kellner alle gegen meine Erwartungen fast ausschließlich nicht-chinesisch-stämmig sind, was dem ganzen einen Hauch Multi-Kulti verleiht, obwohl es sich um ein chinesisches Restaurant handelt. Die chinesischen Mitarbeiter bereiten das Essen in der Küche zu, was zum Authentizitätswert des Essens definitiv beiträgt.
Die Bedienung war sehr flott und zuvorkommend und konnte sich alle Einzelheiten unserer Bestellung ohne Notizzettel merken (Respekt!). Das Essen war gut.
Guter Laden; kann man nicht viel falsch machen.

Chinese food usually is not on top of my cravings-list, but every now and then it's fine.
The restaurant is quite big. One thing that jumped out to me is that the waiting staff was almost exclusively non-Chinese, at least as far I could see. This makes the restaurant seem very multicultural despite of the Chinese setting and nature of the restaurant. I was told that the Chinese staff is responsible for making the food which makes the food experience seem very authentic.
The waiters were very quick and could memorize all details of our order without writing them down (respect!). The food was good.

 I got the vietnamese tofu sandwich with whole grain. They nuked it in a microwave and I had to wait five minutes for it to cool down. The bread was really dry and hard and flavorless. The tofu had no remarkable flavor, and the carrots were seemingly doused with chili to make the flavor of the whole thing. I couldn't eat the sandwich and ended up eating the tofu out of it and going to Joe for a croissant after to be full enough to wait for dinner.

I paid cash which she looked at me annoying because she didn't get to just swipe a card and then when I had change of 1.09 she used one hand and slowly took out nine pennies using one hand acting like she couldn't even use the other hand because she didn't want to wash it again to go back to preparing food.

Took the parents and ladyfriend for dinner last weekend.  It wasn't super crowded at 6:30 pm when we arrived so I got a little nervous.  I needn't have feared though; by the time we finished dinner at 9:30 (more about that later) the place was packed.  I guess it's just one of those places where people dine later in the evening.

Our server was excellent.  Very attentive without being obtrusive.  He described all of the specials on the extensive list by memory, speaking slowly and clearly rather than spouting them off in a Micro Machines voice like some waitstaff tend to do.  To start we had the grilled polenta with broccoli de rabe, mussels in tomato broth, and the grilled eggplant.  All three were exceptional.  My favorite was the eggplant; it could not have been prepared any more perfectly, and I'm not even a huge eggplant fan.

For the main course, I ordered fileted Branzino-as did the ladyfriend-which was prepared in a tomato sauce and served with steamed asparagus.  The fish was melt-in-your-mouth and light yet flavorful.  The asparagus was OK; I prefer asparagus sauteed or grilled.  My dad ordered the fish stew which was also excellent.  My mom ordered veal filet mignon, which I did not taste but judging from her oohs and aahs, was just about perfect.

For dessert we just had coffee/cappuccinos, which were very good.  

Throughout the 3 hours we sat there, service was excellent .  We never felt rushed at all, despite the restaurant filling up as the night wore on.  My mom remarked that the server waited until we had all finished eating before clearing away any plates (it's a pet peeve of hers when servers take plates away while someone is still eating).  

The BYO thing is great, of course.

The first time I went here I had the Ziggy burger and it wasn't bad, but was so messy that it just fell apart everywhere.  I probably would have given it a 3.  The fries are good, but not mind-blowing as some people have described them.

Tonight, I read a ton of great reviews about the Philly Steak, so I was happy to try it.  Somehow, on the 3-block walk home, the sandwich became extremely soggy.  Not just regular messy-sandwich soggy, but so soggy that I couldn't actually pick it up.  I had to eat it with a fork.  The tomatoes and lettuce had already become warm, too.  The mushrooms and mock meat were pretty good, but for some odd reason, there was a ton of ketchup on everything.  It took away from the other flavors.  

Lastly, the prices posted on here are not updated.  The meal was over $15 (something like $9.25 for the sandwich and $4 something for the fries).

If I had been rating this place just based on the inside experience, I would have given it three stars. However, my outside experience was pretty damned abominable. When I ate inside with my boyfriend and two friends, our experience was fairly pleasant. The place is pretty small and shabby (dare I say a little dirty?), but the service was prompt and the employees friendly. My Jerk Shrimp was not as amazing as I had expected, but still palatable to say the least. I got a pineapple soda to wash it down, and I was happy. 

The outside experience, on the other hand, was quite the opposite of pleasant. The hostess was a little abrupt with us, since we questioned the $5 per-person ""entertainment fee"" and $6 PER SIX-PACK ""corkage fee"". Now please, let me define for you a corkage fee (thank you, Answer.com): A charge exacted at a restaurant for every bottle of liquor served that was not bought on the premises. The Jamaican Jerk Hut does not sell any alcohol, so this is a misleading use of the term ""corkage fee""... they aren't losing out on any alcohol sales, since they don't have a liquor license. The only thing they did that was worthy of monetary compensation was provide us with a bucket of ice. That really pissed us off. 

So even before we sat down to eat and drink OUR OWN BEER, we had already shelled out $21 between three of us. (Good thing we brought another six-pack in our backpack that they didn't notice...) Let me just say that I wouldn't mind paying a $5 cover to see an act worthy of that money. However, instead of hearing authentic Jamaican music, which I was hoping for, there was a white guy with dreads who was pretty much the worst Bob Marley impostor I've ever seen. Fake Jamaican accent and everything. There isn't much that I despise more than white people faking Jamaican accents... or anyone faking any accent, for that matter, and trying seriously to get away with it. Anyway, I digress... I'll just say that the music was not up to par.

While we were sitting there trying to endure the terrible music and forget about the through-the-roof prices, we were kind of paying attention to our mostly bland and disappointing food. It seemed like they were mass-preparing meals, except they took three times as long to come out than a mass-prepared meal would. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the coconut shrimp appetizer. The sauce was a little too sweet, but mostly good. The jerk chicken with rice and beans was kind of dry and not as spicy as I would have liked. Very, very disappointing.

Location: easy to get to, connected to the Hotel Palomar, nice area

Ambiance: very nice, servers are attentive, there's a nice bar area, good lighting

Food:
Wine: your average wine, a little steep for the quality you get however

Appetizer: we had the fried calamari, which were OK, the sauce was good, I liked the fried jalapeno slices that were in the dish. Quite a bit of the pieces were actually just fried breading and not the calamari itself. Pretty good appetizer portion for 2 - 3 people, I would think

Bread basket:
warm and tasty! a good combination of different breads. Enjoyed it very much!

Entrees:
I had the vegetarian option, which was the summer cavatelli, a pasta dish. It was tasty, a bit heavy on the balsamic vinegar. I did like the tomatoes and the nice mushrooms that were in it. The pasta was a bit too al dente, but still pretty good

My boyfriend had the duck entree. He said the duck meat was tasty, but the amount was very small. Also, he was a bit put off with the combination of tastes (duck was on top of an egg-omlette thing, and next to it was a potato thing. He really enjoyed the potato, and I tried that and it was quite good. It was like scalloped potatoes but after they cut it into slices they put it all back into a potato shape. It was pretty unique and very tasty. If you're into combination of totally different flavors, this would probably work for you

Dessert:
we had the peach/blackberry cobbler w/ ice cream, and it was superb! the cobbler was warm and delicious, the bread part was very good, and the cold ice cream complemented everything perfectly. It was also a very large cobbler! Definitely good to share. Would highly recommend

My first trip back was for my birthday and it was at least 6 months after my initial visit. I hyped the crap out of the place to my husband and probably set the bar way too high in my own head. As a result, I was a little disappointed. I had the Rotolo which was extraordinary but for whatever reason my Melanzana pizza fell a little flat to me personally. I ended up liking my husband's Salsiccia a little more.

This past Saturday night, my husband and I were looking for a causal but tasty date night so we decided to head back to Pizzeria Vetri. I took the restaurant off its pedestal and ended up having an exceptional dinner. Funny how that works, right? 

So of course we had to get the Rotolo. I can see why it won a 2014 Best of Philly award. It was light, doughy and pesto perfection. I would still enjoy it without the mortadella and ricotta but that adds an even more flavor. I could probably be a happy camper with a meal of 3-4 Rotolos.

I enjoyed the Salsiccia last time so decided to go for a repeat. It didn't disappoint. Pizzeria Vetri's Instagram page had also tantalized me with pictures of the special pizza of the day, so we had to give it a shot as well. It consisted of broccoli rabe stuffed porchetta, mozzarella, black pepper and pecorino cheese. The ingredients were basic enough for a gourmet pizza but together made for a really great taste. The combination of flavors was a little sharp but in a good way.

The service has been excellent for each of my three visits. Our servers have always been polite, professional and extremely polished. On our most recent visit the manager stopped by towards the end of our meal to see how we were doing. 

I don't love the communal style set-up. While dining out, I prefer the company of my own party. My husband and I have taken to liking to the counter seats that face the open kitchen. I personally found the pizza preparation to be extremely enjoyable to watch and for whatever reason oddly therapeutic and relaxing. 

Moral of my update: Pizzeria Vetri serves up some fabulous gourmet pizza but it isn't the best gourmet pizza in the world and certainly not the best atmosphere.

There were many ""likes"" and a few ""dislikes"" to my experience here, which really should deserve 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up just because of the authenticity of this dining experience. 

Likes:  The atmosphere inside the restaurant was absolutely amazing.  You really feel like you're inside someone's living room, eating a home cooked meal.  The rooms are well segregated from each other, so each party gets their own private dining experience.  The decor is authentic, with drapes covering all the walls.  The music was fun, the belly dancer was a lot of fun also.  
FOOD:  The eggplant in the opening salad dish was probably the best eggplant you will ever eat.  My other favorite course was the lamb, it was so tender and fell right off the shank.  The couscous was also good, and so was the whole roast chicken, which was also some of the most tender fall-off-the bone chicken ever.  

Dislikes:  We arrived in a group of 15.  We had to stand outside in the 20 degree weather until all members of our party arrived.  We were outside in the freezing cold at least 15 minutes.  The least they could do is set a heat lamp outside since waiting outside seemed like it happens to everyone.  Once we were seated, it took 10-15 minutes to receive wine classes.  We had about 10 bottles of booze on our tables we brought, and couldn't get glasses after asking 3 different times.  We were wishing we could drink straight from the bottles!  The napkins (whole towels) also took a long time to receive.  When  you eat with your hands, and there's no silverware, you'd think napkins/towels would be the first item they give you once the food arrives.  
FOOD:  The beef kbobs were far too over-cooked, hard to chew.  That was the only food that I didn't like the entire night. 

Overall, the length of my dislikes paragraph is misleading to a 4 star review.  But, like I mentioned overall, the dislikes don't outweigh the overall really cool dining experience here.  I would recommend everyone to try eating here at least once.  It was fun, and very unique.

The bright ""bar"" sign really helped! And the room was cool - large, dark and candlelit, huge bar, nice wooden decor. So, it could have been quite cozy.

Let me start off by saying that the food is amazing. There were no complaints in that department. 

However, I had made reservations for the later seating over a month beforehand. Because of budget stuff and the fact that we live in the suburbs, we really don't get out for things like this often and were really looking forward to a little romantic dinner. We arrived in plenty of time for our reservation. But because of overcrowding, we had to sit communally with two other couples. I wouldn't be so upset about this if we were told ahead of time that there would be a chance of this happening, but they decided after having us sit there in our coats for 10 minutes and didn't really give us a decision in the matter. It really did put a damper on the evening. Luckily, the other two couples were great people and we had some great conversation. And they did serve us as three separate parties of two, so we weren't sharing the plate with a bunch of strangers. 

But then, they decided to include the mandatory 18% for parties of 6 or more despite billing and serving us separately, which was a huge slap in the face. Unfortunately, they lost out, because even when I tip low, I tip more than that.

I love to support smaller businesses and this restaurant is truly unique. But I can't help feel sour about our treatment there.

Parking was really difficult for me as I ended up driving around for a Realllllllly long time as it's all street parking. They do offer valet parking after a certain hour. Also reservations are recommended although I don't think they're mandatory. The service was stellar as was my wife's manicotti  (stellar as in heavenly. ) Anyway let's take a look at my own meal...

Ralph's Famous Veal Parmesan 

What Is It: It's pretty much your traditional chicken parm only with veal instead of chicken. The veal is crusted with the parmesan, topped with mozzarella, and covered in sauce. Spaghetti with sauce as well as pre entree bread is also served.

Presentation: Definitely looks the part even though they plated the spaghetti separate from the veal probably because they give you such a big piece of veal. Nevertheless it looks tremendous. 
9 out of 10

Taste/Final Analysis: With this being one of their signature dishes I had to try this out. This also was my first experience of eating veal. I'm pretty sure this probably wasn't the best way to get a first taste of it as it's covered up with so many other flavours. Now that's not to say that this wasn't a delicious dish because it was. Their sauce in particular should be its own food group it was that good. The veal was crispy and delicious just like a proper parmesan dish. My problem was that it was pretty much identical to a chicken parmesan. The texture, the taste, everything was exactly like a chicken parmesan.  I'm not sure what the uniqueness of having it as ""veal"" parmesan is. Like I said this is a tasty dish but  you might as well get the cheaper chicken parm. The restaurant is definitely worth checking out for both a great meal and experiencing a piece of American history. Just either give yourself plenty if time to park or arrive during their valet parking time.

While being seated and welcomed by a ridiculously hot waitress, I was informed that there was still 20 minutes left in during happy hour, so I ordered a glass of the red wine. It was nothing special, but after a long day at the office, it was just what the doctor had ordered. 

When the waitress returned with my wine, I immediately put in an order for the white bean soup w/ duck confit. When the soup came out,it was so piping hot, I nearly burnt my tongue. OK, I did burn my tongue but nothing was going to stop me from devouring this soup. The soup was rich in texture and flavor. I couldn't imagine starting my meal off with anything else on this frigid Philly night. 

After the soup was disappeared, the main course came out. Can you say Short ribs, barley, and mini carrots? These carrots weren't baby, but they weren't full grown either, lets call them teenage carrots. The bold rich flavor of the short ribs combined nicely with the added texture from the large grains of barely. This was straight up comfort food.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restaurant Week's first pass for 2015 starts on January 18th. One place to consider is Square 1682 - which underwent a bit of an overhaul over the past 2 years under the helm of Chef Caitlyn Mateo. Square 1682 is located in Rittenhouse, within the swanky Hotel Palomar. The atmosphere is sleek, with several high-top tables throughout, as well as a 2nd floor that is slightly more formal.

For the January 2014 RW, the GF and I stopped by along with one of our friends. 

Texan's Mule [$10]
Tito's vodka, ginger beer, gingery syrup, lime juice

This take on the Moscow mule was served with one of my favorite small batch vodkas - Tito's. This iteration of the drink was perfect for the GF, not overly sweet, with great ginger essence.

Classic Bizzy Izzy Highball [$11]
Rittenhouse rye, Dios Baco amontillado, pineapple juice, lemon juice, Agnostura aromatic bitters

Rittenhouse rye tends to speak to me and this didn't disappoint. The whiskey was nicely balanced by the sherry. With the bitters on the forefront and the drink had a nice citrus finish, this was easy drinking.

Bread Service

Dinner started off with a nice spread of crispy, salty sesame lovash, sourdough, and rosemary focaccia. A big pet peeve of mine though? Cold butter - what is the point if you can't spread it?

Restaurant Week Dinner [$35 pp]

As is usually the case - restaurant week dinners are on offer for $35 per person - usually for 3-4 courses. 

Carrot Soup 

The GF and our friend both ordered the carrot soup, which had nice depth and sweetness. The charred brussels sprouts and bacon brought forth balance and created a wonderful spoonful.

Lancaster Duck Toast 
Lingonberry mustard, buttermilk toast 

I went with the duck dish, which featured shredded Lancaster duck and frisee on a toast point. The ligonberry mustard sauce brought out some brightness to each bite, though I wished for some more of the duck flavor.

Bacon Wrapped Dates [$9]
Local goat cheese, piquillo peppers, stone ground mustard vinaigrette  

Feeling a bit peckish despite the first course and two more to come, I ordered the ubiquitous bacon-wrapped dates an a la carte. The bacon was nicely crisp, with the tang of the goat cheese balanced nicely by the sweetness of the dates. The piquillo peppers and mustard vinaigrette offered some acidity and brightness through the heft of the bacon.

Truffle Popcorn [$4]
Truffle butter, citric salt 

The oft-lauded truffle popcorn here had to be tried. The truffle essence definitely emanated through, though the citric salt added the sour salt taste that really made it for me.

Amish Chicken Breast
Beet fettuccine, cauliflower, autumn apples 

For mains, the GF and our friend opted for the tender chicken breast, which was well-seasoned. The beet fettuccine was interesting and had a subtle sweetness. The crisp apples brought fresh tartness that was balanced by the bitter greens and the lightly charred cauliflower.

Custom Blend Burger + Quail Egg [$1 supp]
Smoked portabella, Lancaster cheddar, garlic Parmesan fries

I had the burger and added a quail egg for a dollar supplement. I requested it medium-rare, though it came out medium and overall, the beef was a bit dry and lacked seasoning. The tomato was a bit mealy as well. The fries were decent, though the chipotle aioli was a bit watery. Disappointing overall - should've went with the lamb short ribs. 

Chef's Selection of Sorbet

Desserts fared better though. We had a great selection of sorbets including apple cider, raspberry honey, and hazelnut espresso served with strawberries and blueberries interspersed between. A light and refreshing palate cleanser. 

Butterscotch Cake 
Mascarpone cream, apple caramel  

The cake was buttery, with rich butterscotch essence. The mascarone cream was nicely light and the apple caramel brought some sweetness to each bite.

White Chocolate Bread Pudding 
Dark chocolate gelato

The bread pudding was nicely moist and oozing with sweet intensity. The white chocolate seemed a bit lost, but combined with the dark chocolate gelato, each bite was a sweet ending indeed.

Service was alright, but seemed a bit aloof and uninformed. In fact, they took our bread basket and plates a few minutes after dropping it on our table. We had to flag down the staff to figure out what sorbets were on offer as well. 

Still, the food at Square 1682 has definitely become more creative 3 years back. While a few dishes could have been executed better, I'll chalk that up to the perils of restaurant week.",2015-01-04 19:39:19,"{'food': ['Carrot Soup', 'Lancaster Duck Toast', 'Bacon Wrapped Dates', 'Truffle Popcorn', 'Amish Chicken Breast', 'Custom Blend Burger + Quail Egg'], 'drink': []}"

I am amazed with yelp and without yelp I would not know that some of these restaurants even exist.

So we will have to try Khmer Kitchen some other night and we drove a little way more to Sky Cafe.

South Philly really makes me glad I live in the suburbs. The streets are narrow and cars are parked every where and also at any angle imaginable. It is daunting. After a few laps around the block I was lucky and found a spot that did not test my city parking skills too much. 

Sky Cafe is located on a corner. The place is not big, it probably holds about 25 people and the tables are tight. It is fairly modern, simple and clean. The staff is very good and attentive. The bathroom is tiny.

There were 5 people in my group. We definitely over ordered. We had 2 orders of Satay, 2 orders of spring rolls, Nasi Lemak Rendang, Nasi Pecel Ayam, Fried Tofu, Kari Bihun, and two other dishes.

The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food.

Sky Cafe was pretty crowded on a Saturday night. A lot of Indonesian people were there and a few yelpers. Service is very fast. Definitely worth a visit if your in the area and like South East Asian food.

There is window bar-style seating which is kind of diner-ish.  Once seated, however, I loved the warm, simple IKEA-esque decor and the friendly but not fussy staff.

The quality of the ingredients is excellent and healthy (i.e. unprocessed).  I recommend the egg dishes for breakfast.  Ants Pants is only open until 4pm, but they do breakfast and lunch very well.  The clientele seemed nice, too, some people studying, some families.  The menu is unique but simple, complete with Australian touches like regional slang and trivia about koala bears (they are marsupials, NOT bears!).

Free internet with password, which I couldn't get to work.  Cash only; parking is probably not fabulous for those not within walking distance, but this is Philly, so I think most places are within walking distance.  

They're crowded on the weekends with the slept-in-after-a-fun-evening set, lots of young couples and very congenial.  Lunch items are mostly salads and sandwiches, but with some Australian touches I'd never heard of.

Unfortunately we were left underwhelmed. The food was ok/good. We had the general tso's wings which were good, and then the burgers with salt/pepper fries which were just ok. The burger had no flavor except meat (no salt or pepper) and a tiny little piece of tomato which covered a quarter of the burger and still had the green top part visible, and the salt/pepper fries were highly lacking flavor as well as being crisp. The waiter however was very sweet and helpful. 

What really ruined the whole experience was right in the beginning, before we even tried the food...we were seated at a table for two which was open near the wall (nice and private). There was another 2 seat table that was in a very congested area and right on top of another table and we asked the hostess if we can sit at the more private one, she said no problem. If we couldn't sit there we would have asked to wait until another table opened up, we weren't in a rush.  After we ordered and received drinks, and after we put the food order in, I was finally getting comfortable, since I am pretty pregnant and getting comfortable is a challenge any time we go out (which has been minimal lately) and also we drove 35 mins from Langhorne to get there. All of the sudden a man came over, didn't introduce himself, and very awkwardly asked us if we can move to the other table (the one that was in a congested area and on top of another table). I was completely floored since I have worked many years in the restaurant business and know that once you seat a customer, unless for emergency purposes, you never ask them to move, especially to a shittier table and because you want to seat other people at their table. They wanted to take our current table and combine it with another one once the people next to us left and seat other people that were waiting to get seated. I first expressed how we didn't want to move and definitely didn't want the worse table, however the man (who I believe was Nick the manager according to the website) started making me feel bad about not moving, so I said ok I guess we will move - at that point he said no that's ok you don't have to move, we'll figure something out (this was said in a rather judging and condescending tone). We stayed in our seats, however the mood was fully ruined. I would also like to mention that within 10 minutes there were about 5 empty tables....2 for parties of 4/5 and a bunch of two's. 

Besides the food, the way we were made to feel left a much bigger impression on us. Unfortunately we will not be returning for that reasons alone, although I was hoping to try more of their food at a later date since I was supposed to come back this weekend with girl friends for brunch.

We dined at R2L on a Sunday night. Upon arriving in the downstairs lobby we were met by a young hostess(?)/coat-check-girl who directed us to an elevator which would take us up to the restaurant. Unfortunately, she failed to offer to take our coats/scarves/gloves on a bitterly cold night. She seemed more interested in her iPhone than in assisting us, but she did take our coats when we inquired. Now, up the elevator to the restaurant...

We were promptly greeted by a smiling hostess who informed us that our table would be ready shortly and we could wait at the bar. Standard (albeit frustrating and transparent) revenue-boosting move more commonly associated with upscale chains - made more frustrating by the obvious availability of tables. We had hoped, however, to be seated by the window per our numerous (1 online, 2 phone, 1 in-person) requests. We were not seated by the window. In fact, only 4(?) tables in the whole restaurant were window-side, as half of the restaurant was evidently under renovation. An honest maitre d' would have informed me of this during one of my phone calls explicitly requesting a window table.

We waited an awkwardly long amount of time before our server (very awkwardly) greeted us. When we asked for input on our wine selection (we are pretty serious wine drinkers) our waiter froze, stuttered, and simply informed us that he hadn't tried any of the bottles that had interested us. After an awkward pause, he offered to find someone with more knowledge of the wine list. ""The sommelier, Yes please!"" - we thought, given the size and quality of the wine book. Enter the bartender. The bartender was extremely hospitable and clearly understood the essence of good service. He unfortunately failed to address our specific questions, but he DID allow us to taste several wines that were offered by the glass to assist in our selection. We ended up with an excellent bottle and THIS FACT AND THIS FACT ALONE garnered the restaurant a star for experience.

Food - huge portions, good menu, good execution. Neither avant-garde nor overly safe, I would recommend the food for an ""intro to upscale"" type of meal. Nothing really outstanding, but thoroughly enjoyable.

Value - you pay for the view. Unfortunately, we didn't get one. We could have had comparable quality food at ground level with much more competent staff/service for less money.

Overall - this place has HUGE potential and a good chef. Unfortunately, they are under performing that potential by a large margin. They need to invest in training the entire front of the house staff (except the bartender!) in basic service protocol, starting with the downstairs hostess and maitre d' but focusing on the waitstaff. They could also stand to better define and better enforce the dress code, as some patrons could compromise the atmosphere with their attire.",2013-12-28 21:59:53,"{'food': ['huge portions', 'good menu', 'good execution'], 'drink': []}"

We originally made a Saturday night reservation for two but I felt sick pretty last minute and we had to cancel (which they were really nice about). I was feeling a lot better by Monday so I called them that morning to make a reservation. They don't open until 5pm, so I was pleasantly surprised when they picked up my 10:50am phone call! When we arrived for dinner that night at 6pm, we realized that there was no need to make a reservation as the place was completely empty. A couple showed up as we were finishing our dessert, and they were the only other diners we saw all night.

Like many Yelpers have said, dining at this place feels like you're eating in someone's home. You eat everything with pita bread, which the waiter just left on the table next to ours since there was nobody else around.

Course 1. Trio of salads (eggplant, cucumber and tomato, carrot) - SO GOOD. This could've been a meal by itself.
Course 2. B'Stella (a pie with chicken, eggs, cinnamon, topped with powdered sugar) - It sounds weird and it is weird. Some people love it, but it just wasn't my thing. 
Course 3. Chicken (mild or spicy) - We went with mild. So tender, perfectly spiced and yummy!
Course 4. Beef kebab or lamb - We couldn't decide so our waiter let us try both! While I did enjoy the taste of the beef, it was too tough and hard to chew. The lamb is cooked with honey and almonds so I didn't think I'd enjoy it that much (meat + sweet aren't my favorite combo) but I loved it! It didn't taste too gamey and the meat fell right off the bone...mm, perfection. 
Course 5. Couscous with vegetables, chickpeas and raisins - It was good but I was so deep in my food coma that I don't remember much about this dish. I didn't love the addition of raisins though.
Course 6. Bowl of assorted fruit - I love ending any meal with fresh fruit, but I wish they had been cut up. This was literally just a giant bowl of fruit, like apples, oranges, grapes and bananas. There was so much variety but at that point I had no desire to peel an orange or deal with a whole apple. Call me lazy but I would've much preferred to eat a smaller portion of a fruit salad or something.
Course 7. Baklava and mint tea - I don't really like baklava in general, but this was really good. And the mint tea was the best I've ever had. We had a few cups of that before we headed out!

Our waiter was really attentive but didn't hover around or rush us. Not sure if that's because we were the only people there, but hopefully it's like that when the place is more crowded!

This place gets at least 2 stars for taking provincial surroundings (wooden tables, candelabras with real candles/wax) and pairs it with the boilermaker - beer with a side of whiskey (to be sipped with your beer and not shot). I also like a boilermaker so this place was like a little sliver of heaven for me.

It was hot in here but it seems everywhere this summer is all kinds of hot so I really can't complain. The drinks were fairly priced and the service was just fine. I didn't try the food because nothing on the menu really appealed to me. That's the only major drawback I saw.

We were very happy to hear that Tuesday is in fact Boozeday, which means happy hour specials until 11! Half price drafts, $5 whiskey cocktails (not as good of it sounds), and $5 snacks (not a great deal either). On their drinks menu, they have a section call ""whiskey cocktails,"" but these are not $5 (they range from 9-12), it's only a specific happy hour whiskey lemonade cocktail that is $5. Our party found this to be a very misleading promotion, but the server did explain this clearly when we asked. Also, all of the snacks are already listed at $5-7, so there's not much of a discount there. The good draft beer selection, which are already reasonably priced is clearly the best deal. 

The cocktails were generally well made and tasty. They ranges from $7-13, which is a generally fair price for drinks that often contain higher end ingredients like fruit juices, Luxardo Maraschino, Bulleit Rye, etc. I ordered a Hemingway, their take on the classic Hemingway daquiri, which had rum, grapefruit, lime, simple, and Maraschino liqueur was a bit bland and watery. The classic Hemingway has a double shot of rum--not that I necessarily expected this, but wanted a strong, sour, aggressive drink was what I expected for a drink named after the rugged Hemingway. The other cocktails our table ordered: old fashioned, Manhattan variant (with Pimms), and bourbon sour (with frothed egg white) where well made. Friends that ordered beer where very happy with the selection. 

Food was well priced, large portion sizes and generally at least above average in quality. We ordered and loved the fried pickles. The coating was substantial but not doughy and crisp without being greasy. The honey mustard was just sweet enough to balance the acidity of the pickle. For an entree I ordered the fried chicken. He chicken was brought to the table while still very hot and had a nicely crisp coating that almost shattered on contact but still hung on to skin. The meat was well salted, but I would have like some more spices like black pepper, chili pepper, paprika, garlic powder etc. The chicken came with Mac and cheese served in a large ramekin that was easy twice as much as I expected! The sauce was very creamy and the topping of melted cheese and crisp bacon crumbles was very tasty. My friends enjoy the burger (hell of a deal at $5), the Cobb salad, pulled pork sandwich, and seitan cheesesteak. However, the fries were disappointing limp and greasy. 

I thought the decor was understated, classic  bar decor (dark wood everywhere, quirky taxidermy) but also easily forgettable. I did like how they kept the original tile around the fireplace past the bar that spelled out ""LIBERTIES,"" a nice nod to the bar that use to be B&B. Tables were nicely separated and chairs/booths were comfortable. 

Overall, I think the prices are more than competitive for most food and drink. Service was laidback and easygoing without being complacent. Food came out hot and tasty, drinks cold and refreshing. I just had some minor complaints about the food and drinks but overall had a very good experience.

More popular with the locals due to it's location, if you want really nice desserts try Isgro's Pastries, if you want inspirational pizza try Di Bruno Bros.

Maybe I am misinformed but I also thought Nutella was recently classified as a neurotoxin, in any case I wouldn't try their Nutella cookies unless you're aware of the side-effects.  The parfaits are stingy on fruits and over-priced and a lot of other items seem to be asking for too much price-wise given the low-quality and small amount served.  The mural on the outside is nice to look at and the whimsical nature of the inside makes it seem like it's more than it really is.  It's just an industrial bake shoppe that puts out thoroughly average products.

The owners have certainly put a lot of thought into this new space. Live blues bands add to this fun, inviting atmosphere. Guaranteed, you'll see my friends here on many many weekends to come.

As for the menu, there are still kinks to work out. I think the biggest fault with Twisted Tail is their identity: it's not quite solid yet. The board has some interesting dishes to fit into  their ""bourbon and blues"" and open fire concept, though there are plenty that do not.

BYOB & no corking fee. Everything is delicious, but if I had to put in order of what I thought was amazing to great: Bloody Beet Steak, Salted dark chocolate napoleon, Spice encrusted trout and new jersey risotto with lions mane mushrooms. I can't say for sure where the roasted winter vegetable salad sits within the list since it wasn't my main dish - but I would say top 3. 

The details:

The boyfriend and I decided to have one nice dinner while enjoying an impromptu weekend vacation to Philly. Neither of us had been before and this was truly a highlight of the weekend.

Bloody Beet Steak: Holy Beets. This set the tone for the rest of the meal. This was perfectly balanced - sweet, acidic, fresh, light...I wanted to bury my face into this dish. It's been a while since I've wanted to lick a plate clean. But luckily they give you brioche buns and butter in the beginning so I used that as a vessel into my mouth. 

Roasted Winter Vegetable Salad: It was a hard choice between this and the Beets for me, but luckily my boyfriend got it which was also surprising because he doesn't normally like cauliflower. So is it wrong that I was hoping that he just hated the taste so much that I could have two first courses? Unfortunately for me, he found it delicious and so I was only blessed with the tiniest of bites as he scraped up the rest of the vegetables. The bite was just as well balanced as the beet steak and to be honest, if I could eat vegetables like this more often I think I could be a vegetarian.

New Jersey Risotto with lion mane mushrooms: I'm sure this was possibly called something else, but I remember specifically the waiter mentioned that the risotto comes from Jersey and the lion mane mushrooms came from a local farm near philly. The risotto was done perfectly, and had bits of black truffle along with the lions mane mushroom. The taste of the mushroom

Spice encrusted trout: I'm always hesitant about spice encrusted things. Like, is it going to be overly salty/browned/overpowering that it destroys the flavor of which it is encrusting? But I took a chance, and I'm glad I did. The spice that encrusted the trout was coarsely ground so it gave a beautiful contrast to the meaty fish. The parsnips below were so delicious and sweet which went well with the whole dish.

Salted Dark Chocolate Napoleon: Whenever I go to restaurants, my thought is always ""yes to chocolate"" regardless of how full I am. This isn't your traditional napoleon, the phyllo dough was crispy thin and touched with honey sitting layered between salted dark chocolate mousse topped with white chocolate cream encircled by a caramel sauce. It was exactly what I needed at the end and was surprisingly light.

Khmer Kitchen is, to me and many others, the place to get the legit Southern style Vietnamese food that no Vietnamese restaurant in the USA would ever have the balls to serve, because they can't be bothered to go outside their lazy comfort zone business-wise. Mind you, it's hard to draw the line between dishes of Cambodia and South Vietnam because four score and seven years ago, Cambodia was continuous with South Vietnam (go ahead, google it, it's called the Khmer Empire and it lasted for more than half a millennium). Think of it as fusion cuisine, but neither of those cuisines are Westernized, so your flavors just go BAM. 

Prah-Hok Kateeh - The must-order appetizer dish under the Traditional Khmer Dish section of the menu. The ground pork dip is flavored with a fish paste that has a very subtle pungent yet light aroma, balancing well with the fresh Khmer vegetable selection such as Thai and purple eggplant, carrot, cabbage, long bean (not the typical American green bean). That light pungent-ness is just so pleasureable!
Sah-Law Machue Yuin (with Tilapia) - This is what the Vietnamese call ""canh chua"" but it's a zillion times more authentic than the versions you'll find in most Vietnamese restaurants in the USA. Beautifully tangy tamarind flavor broth with tons of garlic, and it's best to order this dish with the tilapia as this is the correspondingly traditional protein choice. 
Cha Kr'ung (with Frog) - Standard South Vietnamese bar fare, and we ordered it with the frog with was delicious and was a nice white meat with an almost fall-off-the-bone quality, without actually falling off the bones until we actually needed it to. Be forewarned from ordering it ""spicy"" - the waiter asked us if we wanted it this way, and we said yes, not realizing that this place uses Asian standards of spicyness. Just about everyone at our table was ready to choke on the level of spiciness, and I thought we were pretty strong. However, the coconut broth balances out the spice so well, that we suffered through the pain because it was so damn amazing.
Sah-Law Ka-Koe (with pork) - waiter's choice when we asked him for an entree that was ""not sweet"" and very traditional. It's got some sweet-ish pumpkin in it but otherwise the dish is a soupy slightly creamy dish with lemongrass mixed with seafood-y paste flavor, and lots of chopped Thai eggplant. We ordered this with pork as the waiter told us this was the traditional way. This dish also resembles a traditional Vietnamese dish (which just about no Vietnamese restaurants in the US dare to serve) ""canh ca dang"".

We had previously stopped into El Camino for a couple of cocktails and noticed the fine menu, so for sure it was the right choice.

It appeared to be a slow day -- but it was before noon, so we can not judge. It took a bit of effort but we narrowed our choices down to the Huevos Rancheros and the Fried Chicken and Biscuits.

As for the Huevos ... a heaping pile of meat and beans and cheese all snugly in a sizzling skillet. It may have actually been too much to handle as we sadly left more than half in the skillet ...That being said, we would have loved to have finished it as the flavors and textures were right on.

Fried Chicken and Biscuits with Sausage Gravy ... what do we picture? A couple nice and crispy strips of chicken two fluffy cratered biscuits under a blanket of sausage gravy ... the key to this picture would be the inability to actually see the biscuits under the blanket of gravy.... not the case.

If their is one single breakfast item which I crave, it's biscuits and gravy. I do not feel as if I should ever have to ask for more gravy ... the essence of the dish is excess. I don't care how moist you think your biscuits are ... give-me-more-GRAVY!

It killed it for me ... the better half enjoyed her huevos ... and I enjoyed the chicken .... but I pray for a line cook with a heavier hand next time.

I was a few minutes late for my reservation and when I called to inform the hostess, she was so nice about it.  She even thanked me for calling once I finally got to the restaurant.  Let's talk dining room and decor... honestly I don't remember.  The place was nice and is part of the lobby of Hotel Palomar, but it wasn't nice enough for anything to stand out in my mind.  What I do remember is the maze I had to go through to use the restroom.  Since it is part of the hotel, the diners use the hotel facilities and it's a bit of a walk, but I lived so not the biggest deal.  After I was seated I looked through the drink menu and ordered the Fake/Fake.  It was nice and ginger-y.  I could've eaten 10 of the candied ginger pieces if they had given it to me.  While waiting to order I was brought a complimentary bowl of their truffle popcorn.  How fancy was that!  I usually hate popcorn, but I ate that one.  It had truffles in it!  

My meal was pretty fantastic.  I started with the Kale Cesar salad and it was delicious.  I don't usually eat vegetables, but I would definitely eat that salad again.  It was way more interesting than eating a Cesar salad with romaine lettuce.  For my entree I had the lamb short ribs with the cheddar cheese grits.  Can we say YUM!  The meat was cooked to the point where it jumped off the bone and the grits... more please.  The dish also came with broccoli, eh.  It's a basic vegetable, so... yeah.  I ended my meal with the white chocolate bread pudding with a tiny scoop of chocolate semi-fredo.  What a perfect way to end a meal; not to heavy and not too sweet.  

Aside from the yummy food, what sold me on Square was the service.  This place had some of the BEST service I've ever experienced in a restaurant.  Our server, David, was AWESOME!  As many times we talked to him about something, he never seemed annoyed or bothered.

We were on a long weekend from NYC - where it's hard to imagine tasting menu for $55. We were also pleasantly surprised that we managed to snag a booking day of as well.

When we arrived it was super busy, to the extent that it was hard to get in the door. Our booking was for 8.30 - and we didn't get seated until 8.50, which is always annoying. We had a word with the manager, and got a free cocktail each for our trouble. 

The service was great, friendly head waiter Carmen really guided us through the menu - and also provided some great recommendations for where was fun to go out after dinner - thanks Carmen!

So to the food: Although it's billed as four courses there are a few extra amuse bouches that mean it's more like a 6 course. I started with a fois gras soup, which was rich and delicious, followed by garlic and hazelnut snails. I'd never tried snails before, so in the interests of trying something new I ordered them, and was not disappointed.  Next: crispy rabbit salad, which was gamey with a pleasing crunch. Arctic char in a saffron broth was next - fragrant and delicate, and worked well with the celery, a combination that I'd never have thought would work but it did.

Then for pudding, we shared the panacotta, chocolate tort and the jewish apple cake?
Why three deserts when there were two of us you ask? An extra apology for the wait which was very appreciated - and more than made up for the delay. All three were delicious.

So which great service and great food - why only 4 stars? There was only one vegetarian option for the main course - BBQ Parsnip salad, that as a vegetarian my other half ordered. It was fine, but not nearly as subtle as my courses and it could have been better. Meat or fish eaters will be perfectly happy, but this veggie dish felt a bit like an after thought, so the need for a more vegetarian offerings loses this place a star. If I could knock off half a star, I would  - 4 and a half stars would be a fairer score. But for us Spraga was a near perfect dining experience.

The dessert I had (can't remember what it was) was absolutely disgusting.

After reading all the positive yelp reviews, we went back last night to give it a second chance. Thai iced teas were great. The crispy pork spring rolls were delicious, with a great pork flavor (though the crispy spring rolls at Vietnam Cafe are similar and much better). The grilled mixed vegetables with peanut sauce were bland, but the peanut sauce was excellent. I bet the chicken satay is good.  

We were really thinking that we were in for a good dinner until the entrees came. Not only did it take FOREVER for our entrees to come, but they were terrible! We got the pad thai (again, to see if it would be better), but it was exactly the same: bland. Pad Thai is supposed to burst with the flavors of tamarind, fish sauce, bean sprouts, and peanuts. This didn't burst at all.  After reading great things about the crazy pineapple fried rice, I went for it, but it was bad too: the pineapple was absolutely delicious, but didn't go well with the flavor of the fried rice, which was bland and vaguely unpleasant.

We paid $50 with tip for 2 entrees, 2 appetizers, and 2 thai iced teas.

The cheese slice was good, nothing amazing, but the sauce was seasoned correctly. Overall, all the slices didn't have enough cheese and weren't greasy enough (from NY, sorry I love it), but otherwise were correct. Got a tomato, spinach, and ricotta, which could have used more ricotta and mozzarella cheeses for some more grease, but it was still a very warm welcome.

Quite bad actually.

Her ended up getting either fried tilapia or flounder, I cant remember which.

I poked my head in the kitchen and asked the brothers where it was. The chef brother told me I was interrupting him and his brother and that the only place I was allowed to talk to my server was on the floor. I thought he was kidding and the server brother sent me to the restroom. 

I came back from the restroom and the chef brother stopped me as I passed the kitchen to tell me that I was never allowed to come near his kitchen and that I needed to get the hell out of his restaurant. I told him I would be happy to leave since he was obviously insane. 

The server brother came back to ask to the kitchen to investigate why the chef brother was yelling at a customer. As we left I heard the brothers going at it again. 

The service was terrible. Because the brothers were having a bad day it was literally impossible for our table to complete placing an order without our server walking away while someone was speaking. We waited at least 15 minutes to place an order while watching the brothers argue in the door to the kitchen. 

The food we got, bread and either whipped butter in a dish of oil, was revolting. Primarily because none of us could figure out if it was whipped butter or some sort of soft cheese. 

It's obvious this is not the first time there two have had these kinds of arguments in their restaurant with customers present based on how easily they engaged in their unprofessional behavior. It's also obvious by how the chef brother treated me that I am not the first customer he has blown up at for no reason.

The taste was sub par I couldn't finish the sausage bc it was gross, the potatoes were greasy, the eggs were cooked well and so were the pancakes but 13 dollars for a standard breakfast is insane.

Being able to walk from our hotel to Prohibition was pretty awesome, even if there were a few sketchy corners along the way. Once inside, we took in the serpentine bar and packed tables with some difficulty (it was quite dark) and luckily found seats right away; by the time we left, over an hour later, people were standing three deep all around the bar. 

We started out sitting at one of the bar islands, directly across from three strangers; this might appeal to some extreme extroverts, but it was a little awkward for us. They paid us no attention and had a very loud conversation (trendy vocal-fry girls -- ugh) so we tried to return the favor, but they were hard to ignore, so when true bar seats opened up we scooted over and left them to their workplace gripes.

The drink menu is pretty wonderful; awesome draft / bottle selection, in addition to a handful of craft cocktails. We stuck to beer and were not disappointed; the bartender, once he saw what we liked, offered us a couple of samples and was able to continue making us happy through several more rounds. 

We weren't dinner-hungry, but wanted to try the battered green beans since so many had raved about them. They were pretty disappointing; the beans were overcooked and stringy, and the batter stuck together in huge lumps -- it was more like a battered green bean sculpture. We ate about half and left the rest. Next we tried the fried pretzel, which was good, though not exactly pretzel-like, since it had been deep-fried instead of soda-boiled. The accompanying queso was delicious, but there was only one small ramekin, so we ate most of the pretzel plain.

It turned out there had been quite a party a few hours earlier, as the first friday of every month is a pig roast. It sounded intriguing, but our server didn't know any of the details -- where, how and for what amount of time it was cooked, for instance -- so we didn't try it.

There is a reason this place gets five-star after five-star review. 

The chaats are priced similar to the ever popular Chipotle burrito bowls, but the comparisons end there. 

The menu can be overwhelming, especially if you don't even know what chaats are when you walk in. Just let the owner, Hasan, know it's your first time. He'll work with you to create a ""simple"" chaat for your liking.

""Simple"" only being a relative term. I'm not sure I ever had a meal with so many flavors. And not only that, but they all worked together so well. If it was as simple as warming up some chicken and randomly throwing in a handful of a bunch of spices, Philly would be full of 5 star restaurants. Mood cafe has chaats down to a dime. It's quick, relatively healthy and filling too. 5 stars as far as I'm concerned. 

Hasan will also refuse to take your money unless you are satisfied with your meal. He's well aware of the success of the business, as he showed me his five-star Yelp average on his phone. I don't blame him...after all, its rare for a place with this many reviews to consistently get so many top reviews. And as recent reviews show, Mood Cafe isn't coasting on its Yelp fame by lowering quality. Its a tragedy there isn't a second Mood Cafe in NY, but then again, another location might not be able to retain Mood Cafe's magic (I'm convinced the NY Han Dynasty dandan was subpar compared to Philly locations). I guess I'll have to return when I'm in Philly. Until then, keep up serving delicious chaats, Mood Cafe!

I went to try out the brunch (who can do a bad brunch, right?). This place has definitely earned a spot as one of my favorite places for brunch. Honestly, the prices are a on the steep side, not surprising due to the area, and most of their side items SHOULD be included on most the breakfast plates. For example, I think the omelettes should come with a portion of tater totes or a fruit salad, however; you have to order that as an additional side. 

Despite this shortcoming on the brunch menu, the food and drinks are truly great! They have some of the BEST pancakes I have ever tasted! They are large enough to be shared by two people and can be served topped with warm maple syrup, bananas and walnuts. Not to mention they are flurry, buttery and melt in you mouth delicious. They are to DIE for. I ordered a fruit bowl (berries, grapes, apples) the Grasshopper milkshake and I tried the Quiche. The quiche was light and fluffy and came with a side salad. Again, tater totes should be added on the plate. In addition, the quiche should come with an additional slice, its that great. 

Last but not least, the drinks. I tried a White Cranberry Orange Sangria and an adult milkshake. The sangria was so-so. It came in a small wine glass which was a disappointment since it was about $9.00. I had better tasting and sizes elsewhere. On the other hand, the adult milkshake, you guessed it made with alcohol, was creamy delicious made with chocolate  and topped with mint.

First of all, we went on a monday morning to dodge the crowd.  We heard from friends that the wait could get seriously prohibitive.

I had a fresh-squeezed orange juice which was incredible.  Any fresh squeezed juice that I've had has been amazing, but the price was equally palatable.  The coffee is still on my ""to-try"" list, however I hear its very good.

I had the Challah French Toast (~$7.25) which came as advertised. It was very basic for the price.  Real maple syrup made this dish one of the best french toast I've had in quite some time.  To add to that, the blueberry preserves on the table complemented the meal quite well.  However, I would have appreciated a potato latke or some other side as the meal was... basic.

My wife got an omelet of modest size but smaller than I'd like, which tasted very good.  Their redskin potato home-fry was rather poorly made.  It tasted too much like olive-oil and was seasoned with WAY too much rosemary.  A decent spread but I couldn't help but feel like I was paying a bit for the experience as the food left a little lacking.

Bottom Line:  A great spot for a nice breakfast, but not quite worth the price for the taste and portion.

Looking around, I was impressed with the 70's inspired retro decor- the shag carpet, the stone pillars, the cozy seating and comfortable booths perfect for lounging... while my boyfriend's immediate reaction was 'it seems like an upscale Denny's...' Giving a quick first glance at the menu and it appeared that might be the case- although I was hoping for better. 

We each ordered a bloody mary (a weekend necessity that so few of our favorite brunch spots offer...) - they were great and the spicyness was done just right.  Our attentive waitress returned to take our orders- I got the heuvos rancheros and my boyfriend the salmon eggs benedict.  

Our food arrived promptly- though the portions were a bit smaller than I had expected for the price we were paying (Is that how it worked in the 70s?).  My huevos rancheros was drenched in shredded cheese- the eggs were ok, though I felt the dish as a whole was a little bit of a mushy mess...usually when I order this dish you can actually see the tortilla shell and they use cooked black beans, though happy to see that they made this without the chorizo ...My boyfriend really enjoyed his salmon eggs benedict - althought thought the english muffin was odd and strangely thin.  We didn't really get the tater tots on the side....is this *really* '70's comfort food' or just plain high school cafeteria cuisine?

In theory this sounds like a cool event. Well, apparently by the size of the crowd I'm not the only one that thinks this. I mean Night Market is fun if you like waiting in long lines with swarms of people. 

I didn't have much time to dedicate to South Street Night Market. My group probably got to South Street around 7:30 and had to leave for another event by 9/9:30. Rather than waiting in a beer line, we beelined to the state store. What a saving grace! We were able to buy ""juice boxes"" of wine and no one cared that we were drinking them in public on the street. 

Earlier in the day, I had printed out the map and vendor list and checked off about 20-25 places I would like to try. I had hoped to hit at least 2-3 places. Wishful thinking! I know I was being picky about my selections and expectations... I wanted to try a vendor that I've never had before and I didn't want to pick a restaurant that had a store front that I can visit any old day. We started at 9th and by the time we got to the corner of 6th, I knew I had to make a quick decision if I wanted to eat before leaving. Ka'Chi was in the right place at the right time. Luckily it was on my preselected list of vendors.

I spent the majority of my time at Night Market waiting in that line. I was surrounded by friends and the other people on line were friendly so it could have been worse...it also could have been better. I'll review Ka'Chi separately but in short the food was good and I'm glad I waited BUT it really wasn't worth the wait.  Philadelphia has really stepped up its game with food trucks so its probably best to find them on an ""off"" day. Unfortunately, I was only able to eat at one vendor and not make a dent on my ambitious list. 

I think I'll be passing on the next Night Market in China Town... unless the allure sucks me back in.",2013-08-16 15:02:49,

It's a bit of a chain restaurant, albeit a small chain, but there are enough locations for me to question how great the food could be across the board. 

The University City location is a few steps away from my office, so I finally decided to try it today for lunch. They offer a decent selection of entrees as part of a lunch special, which prices options between $8.50 - $10.  I was told the lunch special portion size is smaller than you'd get if you purchased a regular entree, but there was more than enough food for me.  I'm still very full 2 hours later. 

I had lunch alone today, so I sat at the bar and they offered complementary water and tea. I also took a look at their draft menu, which had a nice selection of craft brews.  They also offer a decent amount of bottled beer, cocktails, wine, etc. They definitely don't skimp in the bar offerings.

For lunch I had the Garlic Sauce Chicken, which came with rice on the side.  It came out really quickly, definitely less than 10 minutes after ordering.  This surprised me, and not necessarily in a good way, I immediately questioned how good it could be if it was cooked and brought out so quickly. However, my fears immediately went away with the first bite. The food was hot and delicious. I don't think Han Dynasty is trying to offer truly authentic Chinese food, this seemed like an American Chinese dish. That didn't matter though, the food was great and 100% better than any of the surrounding University City Chinese food restaurants and trucks that I've eaten at.  Han Dynasty might be a few dollars more for lunch, but the taste and quantity makes it worthwhile.

Located inside Reading Terminal Market, there are many food stall to choose from, but Beck's is the only one with Louisiana style foods.  I came here for lunch after reading some pretty good reviews.

Decor:
Like many of the food vendors of Reading Terminal, they presentation is not the focus.  It was still a fairly clean cooking area and everything was labeled properly.  There was nothing to really complain about regarding the decorations given the surrounding food stalls.

Food:
I ordered the beignets which are only available on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  It was around $8 for a bunch of fried dough balls with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.  They were freshly made to order and came inside a plastic container.  The dough itself was rather dense and did not have the light and fluffy texture that I was hoping for.  They were not as good as I had hoped, but I would be willing to try the savory options in the future.

Service:
The lady who took my order was really nice, but the lines leading up to the register can be quite confusing.  With so many people walking around the market and stopping to look at the food, it was hard to tell who was waiting for food and who was just standing around.  After placing my order I was told to wait to the side, but the food took a while to come out.  Luckily, they were piping hot when I received them, which makes up for some of the wait time.

I'll start by saying it is a strange ambiance because it is supposed to be an old speakeasy feel but there is a large screen TV in the front promoting their upstairs music venue. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of bringing music into the mix (one of my fav. local bands actually played there the night after), but it just kind of takes away from the feel they were going for. 

It was nice to see the bar pretty full on a Friday night, definitely not a common occurrence at the former, Liberties.

Moving on. Their menu offers a large variety of food from sandwiches to ""pies"" and salads. Next time I have my eye on the pork belly banh mi sliders. I ordered the Reuban and it was very well executed and was the perfect amount of food for $10. The fiance ordered the smoked turkey sandwich and was also satisfied with his selection. The sandwiches come with a pickle and these house made parmesan chips that are off the chain. (It's $1 to sub in fries). We also ordered fried pickles, they were kind of bland, and doughy (I think the frier wasn't hot enough or they weren't swimming in there long enough). The sauce they came with was also kind of weird and too sweet. 

The craft beer selection is decent but there are no prices listed on the board--and for a good reason. They are entirely too expensive, even for nolibs. 

I will probably stop back in another time to try out a cocktail and a few other menu items. Maybe I'll even catch a show. B&B has a lot of potential but I'm not hooked yet.",2014-04-01 16:32:26,"{'food': ['sandwiches', 'pies', 'salads', 'pork belly banh mi sliders'], 'drink': []}"

BOTTOM LINE: I invest in you; you need to invest in customer service training and scripting. 

I've been to Brooklyn Bareburger a bunch of times for dine-in and takeout. No problems. 

I dined in once at Walnut St. and had no complaints worth writing. Today, I ordered takeout, and am now doubting that I will ever go back. 

I ordered the Wiki Wiki and a full order of sweet fries (with curry ginger ketchup) to go. I drank a Mexican Mule while I waited; no complaints about the drink. I live a distance from the restaurant, so I wasn't expecting the perfect experience when I got home. I just wanted my Bareburger. 

While waiting, I sent the groupon to skeptical friends. You know, the ones who can't see paying over $20 for a burger and fries. Yeah, I was a fan. I left happy. 

When I got home, I saw that I'd been given a side order of regular fries with a single packet of generic ketchup. Disappointing, yes, but not fatal. What ruined the experience was poor communication. 

The bartender, whom I'd liked, first responded by saying he hadn't bagged my order (not helpful, since we both knew I was there, and already knew this). Then he added that he would look into the problem. If only he had said the second part without the first. At one point, he commented that he knew I was so looking forward to the sweet fries. This sounded condescending, particularly since I hadn't shared any sweet fry fetish with him. After he offered me a credit for exactly what I was missing, I asked to speak with a manager. 

The manager's (John's) first response was ""But that was a while ago."" I offered to send a snapshot of what I'd received, and he declined. I then told him just how far away I live. I won't write about how inappropriate it is to begin a customer service call with skepticism. I'm not a trainer at Bareburger. But the implications of this sort of approach can be found in the writing of Ta Nehisi Coates. 

Then John confused my complaint, thinking I'd received sweets when I wanted plain fries. I corrected him, as did a voice in the background. Then John suggested that everything was probably gross by the time I got home. It sounded and felt as snarky/dismissive/disrespectful/unhelpful as it reads. I asked him to clarify the point of that statement. He dropped that tactic, and explained that they'd normally deliver the corrected order, but I was too far away. I expressed that I understood. 

I asked John to tell me what he COULD do, since a credit for exactly what I was missing seemed inadequate. He asked me how I'd paid (groupon plus a credit card), told me he could look into contacting groupon, and told me he didn't know how that worked. I asked again ""What CAN you do John?"" I also explained, again, that an even credit wasn't enough for the current disappointment. 

Finally, he explained that they usually add a little extra to the credit, to make up for a past error. He used the price of a side order as an example. I asked him what the credit would be for exactly what I'd ordered. Then we got to $10 and an apology. 

I still don't know why it was so hard...??? Customer Service skills are not automatic, and my sense is that Bareburger is winging it. Unfortunately, winging it has had an alienating effect on me. I'm contacting Bareburger corporate, and groupon, for a more satisfactory customer service experience.",2015-11-21 23:31:39,

I ordered the hot chicken sandwich with fries. I also ordered a beer. My sister ordered the grilled caesar salad with grilled chicken. The chicken sandwich was delicious. The chicken was perfectly fried. The batter was flavorful and crunchy. The bun was fresh and pretty tasty. The sandwich came with an aioli sauce and pickles. It was an excellent sandwich (though I would have preferred a tomato and red onion).  The sandwich came with a good size of delicious thick-cut french fries. Definitely some of the best french fries I've had in the City. Despite the good amount of fries, the sandwich could have been bigger, especially for $14. 

The caesar salad was essentially a half head of romaine grilled with bread crumbs and topped with anchovies. My sister asked for dressing on the side and it was a big bowl of dressing. The chicken was a bit bland but it tasted very fresh. My sister really enjoyed the salad. I tried it and thought it was tasty. Again, should have been a bit bigger for $16. 

The place looks really nice and inviting. The restaurant gets great natural light. It is very clean and well-kept. The server was very nice and accommodating.

A friend and I decided to try a new sushi place for dinner and landed on Crazy Sushi. We got to the restaurant with a bottle of wine and both of us were very hungry. We were seated at a table, given menus and the hostess opened our bottle. We chatted a bit, had some wine, and looked over the menu. The first 5 minutes we were there the waiter came over 3 times to ask if we were ready to order the menu is huge so it took us some time. We finally ordered, food came out quickly, very quickly. The server paid no attention to the fact that some of our belongings were on the table (keys, cell phones, etc) before we could move anything he placed our plates directly on top of everything. We ate, food was good not great, we split 2 rolls and a bento box, with the intention of ordering more if this was not filling enough. Before we finished eating we were brought our check, which destroyed any possibility of ordering more. We ate all the sushi and were picking at the bento box and drinking our wine when our server came over to take our check, my friend stopped him because we had not put our money in it yet and explained that we were still eating and drinking and not ready to pay. Then the waiter said ""So you can't pay your bill and finish your food?"" so so so rudely. We both stared at him in shock as he continued to rush us to pay him and get out of the restaurant. I have never experienced anything like it, mind you we were not even there for an hour when this occurred. We were so uncomfortable we did not finish the food or wine and just left.

I wandered in here tonight after getting lost and very, very wet. I stood at the hostess/Please wait to be seated table and no one bothered to make eye contact with me or acknowledged me. Went to the bathroom and came back. Again no acknowledgement until the bartender asked if I needed to be seated. I had the choice of a small table sanwiched right in the middle of a bunch of tables or the bar. I chose the bar.

I ordered a Paulaner and the Copa burger with Spanish fries. The Paulaner came pretty fast and was pretty tasty. It's always nice when you find a place that cleans their taplines. Too many places around here don't. The Copa burger and fries came out after a bit. The fries were smokin' hot so I ate a good portion of the burger first. The Copa burger comes with mild green chiles, Monterey Jack,  and bacon on it. The chiles were decent, as was the cheese and bacon. Unfortunately my burger, which I ordered medium well to hopefully get medium, was more like medium rare. Lots of pink and juices. I like a little juice but not that much. The fries were decent but I'm not sure they were ""award winning"". And how serving fries with little green chiles and fried onions counts as being Spanish, I don't know.

The service was ok, but not that great. It took a long time to get a second beer. It seemed like they were understaffed for how many people were there. That and/or I was getting ignored.

I frequent laban's favorites, bubblefish being one of them and the last visit left something to be desired. The fork in the road left me with two options, Royal Izakaya or Tuna Bar, and boy am I glad I chose the latter.

The ambiance is on point, and the service is friendly and welcoming. The menu is curated beautifully, from my understanding they narrowed it down quite a bit from the other location. This means everything on the menu is guaranteed to be fantastic and FRESH.

We started with the steamed chicken dumplings which were light and steamed to perfection. The ginger salad followed with slices of avocado and wonderfully balanced ginger dressing that wasn't too sweet. And they even do spring mix, which was great considering romaine isn't the best these days. 

For our sushi selections we went with the classic dragon roll, the east roll, the j & j roll, and 4 pieces of the tasmanian salmon, which is a fattier cut of wild caught alaskan salmon. The fish absolutely melted in your mouth and highlighted the night beautifully. The dragon roll was crafted wonderfully and the rice on every selection seemed to highlight the delicate subtleties of genuinely fresh fish. The wasabi was even a notch above. I don't know what else I can say besides try it for yourself. The preparation of everything was so wonderfully thought out and you can tell they care about what they do here. Ken was also present and very humble about my compliments.

To start off, the food is good. The rolls are priced fairly, and the veggie gyoza compares to the best of the same that I've had in Cali (full disclosure: I think Cali has the best Japanese food in the country). The plates are beautifully decorated, and I think the decor inside the place, bar the color changing effects, are absolutely beautiful (I'm a fan of contemporary design). In particular, the sweet potato roll and the cucumber+avocado roll are my favorites, although I'm looking forward to trying the mango one soon too.

In any case, I really want to like the place, but the constant finding of hairs (not ours) in the food during our two visits and the subsequent 'not-caring' of the wait staff has been somewhat disappointing. Further, the lack of attention to detail - not bringing over new soy sauce containers when the other one is empty, not refilling water, etc. is disappointing as well, and in all, costs Crazy Sushi 2 stars.

That being said I can't begin to say how disappointed I am in the service (or lack there of) I received tonight. I actually frequent this restaurant and have for years. Tonight I attempted to bring 7 of my friends along to enjoy dinner here for a birthday celebration. When we arrived we asked what the wait time would be. The hostess who was very nice told us 20-25 minutes for indoor or we could be seated immediately outdoor. The 8 of us were talking and another woman arrived at the hostess station and told her it would not be 25 min but 45 to an hour. So we asked to be seated outside. The hostess explained that if we chose to eat outside if it rained there would be no guarantee we could be moved indoors. We agreed and that was fine. The hostess then mentioned to the other young lady (who I would later find out was named laney) that we chose outside and she was worried about the rain. Laney told her ""well that isn't our problem"". During the time that I was speaking to the hostess the other young woman kept repeating what the hostess was telling me. I'm an adult and I can hear plenty well so I knew what she was saying the first time and didn't need a third party repeating it. 

While the hostess sat the rest of my party I stuck around to ask the young lady if there was a problem or if we had done something to annoy or offend her. She simply stated she wasn't referring to us she was talking about something else. Ok. 

After the hostess sat us, no one ever arrived to take our order. No one even brought us water or asked if we wanted a drink. Nothing. To be so worried about us possibly eating in the rain, yet no one cared to try to get our order in a timely manner.  

After waiting with no sign of service what so ever, I picked all of our menus up and returned them to the hostess. I have never been so disappointed in the service I've received here. It's one of my favorite places to eat but tonight it left a bad taste in my mouth.",2014-07-28 01:59:16,"{'food': ['dish'], 'drink': ['drink']}"

It's fun, cute and chewy. One would think that it's hard for a specialty eatery like Maru Global to get by, I mean let's face it, Americans are not know for trying stuff that they are not familiar with and how can you really sustain a shop that only specializes in one thing? Though, Maru Global succeeded in breaching the gap between the familiar with the unknown. 

Other than offering the traditional takoyaki, they expanded the concept by offering the choice of chicken and beef in addition to octopus. They also offer pizza balls, cheesesteak balls, spicy shrimp balls, crabcake balls, as well as dessert ones like chocolate banana balls. Other than balls, they also offer curry fries/rice/burritos, yakisobas, miso soup, salad and other little Japanese food and drinks.

The decor is clean, the air conditioning can be upgraded. The portions are a little small. The food itself tastes ok but it's nothing stellar.

I have been to Jones twice for dinner.  The most recent occasion was a Friday evening for my dad's birthday before seeing a play at the nearby Walnut Street Theater.  It was early-ish for a Friday (around 6pm) so we were seated right away.  I really like the atmosphere in Jones.  It's very open and the decor is fun, yet soothing.  I love the fireplaces.

My dad picked the wine so I've never looked at the list, but what he chose was good.  We ordered the pierogies as an appetizer and for my meal I had the Texas BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich.  Dessert was the peanut butter pie with some of the excellent homemade ice cream on the side.  I don't remember what my parents ordered but everything was delicious and everyone was happy with their meals.  Good sized portions although the app only came with four pierogies which wasn't enough for three people...but maybe that's just me because I love pierogies and could have finished the entire plate myself...

Our service was excellent.  She was very friendly and knowledgeable and helpful in making choices.

It's a pretty casual restaurant.  I'm sure on weekend evening especially you will see most patrons dressed nicely but my first time dining here was before a Phillies game in jeans and a sweatshirt and I didn't feel uncomfortable.

Ralph's has been a favorite of mine since 2003.  My wife and I always try to invent reasons to take the trip from Bucks County to South Philly.  Ralph's is consistently the best Italian food restaurant that I have ever been to.  Their food is that good that both my wife and I always order the same items.  Veal parm with a side a spaghetti for me and shrimp scampi for my wife with 2 pieces of cannoli cake for desert.

The veal parm is not only delicious but also comes in a generous portion.  Ralph's make the veal dish seem easy as it is a nice piece of veal (never, never had any fat in the 7-10 times that I have been there) that is pounded out thin and coated with breading.  The portion covers the oval plate and is enveloped by a thin red sauce.  The veal melts in your mouth and is complimented by cheese and their sauce.  The sauce is not too strong or too thick and seems to work well with the flavor of he veal.  The side dish of pasta is always filling.

My wife and I refuse to order salads or appetizers as we look forward to the cannoli cake.  The cake comes out chilled and is yellow cake with the icing made of cannoli filling.  There is even a mini cannoli on top!  This is the most delicious cake that my wife and I have ever eaten.  We have even found out where Ralph's orders the cakes from!  This is a must order for any diner at Ralph's.

The ambiance of Ralph's is ""old world"" Italian and I feel like Skinny Joey Merlino or Nicky Scarfo could walk in at any time.  The rooms are narrow and the first floor can get loud.  The waiters work efficiently and are not overly warm, but somehow it works in this environment.  Ralph's lets their food impress their patrons instead of fancy furnishings or overbearing staff.  Credit Cards are not accepted, but there is an ATM on the first floor.  Reservations are only accepted for parties of 5 or more and during peak times a wait is to be expected.

It popped up randomly while I was looking for a new place for lunch, and it has quickly become my not-so-guilty pleasure in the city. Just... UMG. I got the Ziggy Burger based on the review here, and I was hooked. It's flavorful, it fulfills my oral cravings, the lightly pickled cucumber in the burger is a zippy surprise, and is just what I want after walking across the city. 

Yes, I walk from 30th Street Station over to 17th, and back during my lunch break; it's a perfect 40 minute walk with a lovely break in the middle. It certainly helps eliminate any guilt I MIGHT feel after chowing down on such delicious vegetarian fare. Heck, I'm not a vegetarian, and I could happily dine on Ziggy Burgers and their fries and dip until I die.

Did I mention the fries yet? Oh dear. I asked someone in the shop if they were in line, and when they said they were trying to decide what to get I suggested the Ziggy burger ""and don't forget the fries, they're amazing"". She got right into line behind me and ordered the same thing, and I hope she enjoyed it. The cilantro black-bean dip is to die for. It's a very subtle flavor, but it's a flavor that melds so beautifully with the sweet saltiness of the fries. Heck, I had some for lunch today, and I regret not sucking down those last few fries now that I'm about to have dinner. It's a good thing I live outside the city and only work there, otherwise I'd eat at HipCityVeg twice a day.

It can get a little crowded... Okay, that's a lie. I've never seen the place without a line out the door.

The pork hot sauce style was just as good, especially with the complimentary rice (by the way, you can ask for more rice if you run out, and it won't cost you more). It was nice and spicy, but you could also adjust the spice, so there's something for everyone. I would give the noodles a 4.5/5 and the pork a 4/5 (it was a little too oily, but that's just my personal taste). 

In addition, they give you tea free of charge! I had always thought that was expected in Chinese restaurants, especially based on my experiences, but it seems that in some Chinese restaurants on the east coast, they charge for tea. So I was very happy to see that I had nice, light tea to complement my food. I left feeling extremely full.

If you could give 4.5 stars I would, but I can't go quite that far so I had to drop it to 4.  Taking into account the whole experience, there were a few things that made me give it a 4 though.  Let's start with the burger.  I had the basic burger.  It was very good and among the better ones I've had in and around the Philly area.  I was a bit disappointed when I asked what kind of cheese they put on it.  The server responded with American or Cheddar.  Now, to be a top burger, I believe you have to step outside the traditional cheese box and go with something a bit more exotic.  Having the standards is fine with me, but I like to see a gruyere or goat cheese option.  I bit into the burger and it oozed out plenty of juices-this is exactly what you want to see in that first bite as you know it's cooked the way it should be.  Along with my burger, I got an 8 oz. bottle of Coke.  Let me say that again-- for my meal, I had to ration myself with a measly 8 ounces of soda.  Lose the bottles of soda and spring for a fountain drink system.  My last gripe was the price of the meal.  The restaurant has servers so, of course, you have to tip.  I didn't get fries with my burger, but if I did, it would have cost $20 for a burger, fries, and 8 oz. soda.  The eatery is in a strip plaza in northeast Philadelphia.

It's a pretty small, cozy spot, nestled on ever-bustling South St.  Kind of conspicuous, but let's hope it can establish itself in a neighborhood known for its diverse offering of venues.  Surprisingly enough, however, the main floor is VERY conducive to groups, it's wide and inviting...in fact I met some new friends before I could even get a brew in hand!  The decor and mood are modern, trendy, sophisticated without being snobbish.

THE FOOD/DRINKS:
I doubt the drinks we had were typical of Sonam's offering, but DAMN were they good-- I had the pale ale (I wish I would have explored these microbrews more) and then got into the vodka drinks, the green melon/lime mojitotini or whatever it was was delicious...delicious enough for Dave and myself to drink them as shots.  Surprisingly enough, I didn't get toooo drunk.  

The food was good too for the most part...the skewers and empanadas were good, but what the hell was going on with soup in a pear??  Keep the soup, just give me the pear...I know it's very cool nowadays to mix flavors and foods in unconventional new ways, but soup in a pear is not a good exercise in gourmet food.  Desert was lovely as well.

I've been to T3 five times and have eaten there on three occasions.  I've consistently had good food, though I struggle with the price for the value and portion size.  My most favorite foods there so far have been the fried tomatoes (on special), corn fritters, primal chili, crabcakes and blackened catfish.  Prices are too prohibitive on their charcoal menu offerings (with no sides?!?!) to entice me.  Service has always been quick and accomodating and all of my meals have always come out hot with the appropriate condiments.  Great bartending with special emphasis on liquor/cocktail knowledge AND food pairings.  I've never been bored with my bourbons there, and it never fails that I am offered something that I've not tried before.

The decor in the venue is simple yet interesting.  Whiskey barrels serve as seats and foundations for the tables and bar upstairs, though the hard bar seats are hell on the ass with little back support.  The lounge area has inviting couches, a fireplace and shuffleboard.  There's a distinct lack of scuzzy people hanging out and that's almost enough for me to give them an extra star!

Twisted Tail has become a hotspot in the Delaware Valley for blues performers.  House band Mikey Junior and the Stone Cold Blues Band (have competed several years at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis) rock the spot weekly and host the Open Jam on Sunday evenings.  Other local and regional acts have graced the stage, to include Roger Girke, Georgie Bonds and Deb Callahan.  My only whine is that acoustically, the band space is far from perfect. The narrow chamber limits the ability to get a substantial audience in to see the musicians; there are only two tables on the floor up in the front of the room.  The bands are backed by glass windows and surrounded by brick in the long, narrow room; sound vigorously jettisons around in the room.  It would be easy to put some stylish acoustic material in the clamshell where the bands play to control some of the harshness.

My other criticism?  My sense is that the chef and management is overthinking, coming close to ruining the simplicity of southern cooking with nouvelle techniques and ideas.  This isn't a BBQ joint an they should probably stop peddling themselves as such unless they truly change the menu and employ KISS priciples.  In turn, they'd be bringing in far more people and getting far better reviews with easier-to-deliver fare.",2012-02-03 04:58:24,"{'food': ['fried tomatoes', 'corn fritters', 'primal chili', 'crabcakes', 'blackened catfish'], 'drink': []}"

Drinks - Two flights of tequila supplied by greasy man hitting on us - AWESOME. The only issue was once we were done with the tequila our server was supposed to get us margaritas with our choice of tequila. She was so busy that we never got the chance to really flag her down. Not the end of the world, partially our fault. 

Moving on.

The quacamole was so buttery! We just ordered it sort of plain with jalapenos, cilantro and tomatoes. 

I got the empanada app which was very good. The chicken inside had a lot of flavor and the crust was perfectly crusty. I got the short ribs for my main and forgive me because I forget what it came with, but everything was good. Definitely a solid three for the dinner.

The dessert was just weird. I wanted to be adventurous. But I guess sweet/spicy sauce and chocolate just don't do it for me. I took one taste of the chocolate tart and instantly wanted to vomit. That has never happened to me before and I was embarassed by my poor choice!!! My dining companion chose the better dessert - the mango mousse cake something or other, and that was sweet!

The food and drinks (we did the pairing menu) were great, with the exception of the pork which was extremely salty. I would have offered four stars for that. Instead I'm giving Sbraga a grudging 2 stars, because the the overall service was so rushed it basically ruined the meal.

Plates and wines were delivered and snatched away within moments of one another, and we spent the meal with one of the servers watching us eat, and checking her watch. No joke. At one point a server asked mid bite how I was doing and peered over to see if my plate could be removed.  If they could have dispatched us in 30 minutes they would have. Instead we held on for a bitter hour.

By dessert we had become so uncomfortable being ""timed"" that we simply offered up to our server that we could move so they could seat a larger group (obviously part of their goal in shooing us along).  Why one of the clock-watching staff could not have taken the initiative and politely suggested this, perhaps seating us at the counter with a complimentary drink for the hassle, I'm not sure.

I had read the reviews and had expected great, friendly customer service but I definitely wasn't prepared for just how nice and friendly.  And not in one of those fake- let me ask you a million times if you need anything- kind of ways.  Just genuinely happy and kind.  Even gave me a free sample of a smoothie!

The chicken was so tender and flavorful and all the toppings joined together in the perfect compliment to the meat.  I am a huge believer of ordering something ""the way it was intended"" at least the first time I get something.  This came with tzatziki sauce, hummus, red onion, pickle, tomato and romaine.  Typically I may balk a little at the red onion but it had none of the bitter bite I usually find.  The romaine was unbelievably green, crisp and fresh.  The pickle was the perfect companion to the hummus and tzatziki, just the right amount of tang.

My sister and I were planning to go to Roberto's around the corner, but they had a wait, and we were starving, so decided to finally give the La Va weekend BYO dinner a try.  The atmosphere of the cafe works fine for an evening dinner...cozy with warm lighting.

I ordered a sausage dish that came on a hot pan, and my sister had chicken and vegetables.  We also ordered a few cold appetizers, which were reasonably priced and very tasty (grape leaves and a tomato dish, the name of which I've forgotten.)  Bread was warm off the panini press.

The portion size was nice, as well.  My sister's chicken was flavorful and  well-cooked.  We definitely enjoyed our food.

We came in on a Saturday night, but fortunately early enough in where we were seated before the rush arrived. 

We ordered;

Roti Canai
Mee Siam
Crispy Spicy Squid
Steamed Bass With Ginger Sauce
Chicken With Vegetables On Fried Taro

I'm not sure the name of the last dish we ordered, but it was a stir fry combinations of chicken breast and vegetables then set on a round fried bed of Taro root. 

Everything was delicious. My favorites were the Taro Root entree, Roti Canai and Mee Siam which to me was a cross between Filipino Pansit and Thai Pad Thai. The Roti Canai was prepared perfectly and accompanied with a chicken and potato yellow curry that was on point. The spicy squid was decent. The steamed bass wasn't very fresh. Additionally, it was very skinny and the sauce was just ginger. There wasn't any scallions or flavor as expected from the menu description. 

I would definitely return but not order the steamed fish with ginger and squid. I'd like to try more of their curries which seem really good here!

The picturesque street is an ideal location for this intimate space. The restaurant  has a fabulous bar, with a daily happy hour (including $6 margaritas) at the bar. There is a a sunken dining room with lots of wooden tables and warm colors.

The service is great, and the staff is very friendly. I've also heard great things about the Molcajete Dinner for 2, which is available Sunday-Thursday, and includes make your own tacos of various proteins.

We started the meal with some customized Guacamole ($9). Each table in the dining room is set with a guacamole form and pencil in order to complete a checklist of ingredients and mix ins. We chose to have ours made with cilantro. chipotle, cotija cheese, plum tomato, and roasted garlic. The guacamole comes to the table in a heaping bowl with a sprinkling of cotija cheese resembling snow on top. The guacamole has a nice briny taste, along with a pop of citrus, offsets the saltiness. It's very creamy, but still has the house made chunky consistency. There's an aftertaste of spicy heat without too much of a bite. Instead there's a building heat from the more mild chipotle pepper, and freshness from the cilantro. The fresh plum tomato gives a nice chewy change from the creaminess of the avocado on alternating bites, and the house made  tortilla chips gave a great crunch. Great way to start off the meal!

My friend ordered the Ahi Tuna Ceviche ($12) as her main meal. The ahi tuna itself was super fresh, sliced very thin, and came dressed in a citrus and guajillo chili marinade. The tuna is garnished with some micro cilantro and cucumber. The dish had a subtle heat from the guajillo chilis and a punch of flavor from the marinade, which was refreshing and helped cut through the richness of the avocado and cheese. The dish only came with three yucca chips, but there were plenty of leftover chips from the guacamole to scoop up the rest of the tuna.

I opted for a far less healthy, but super delicious entree choice - the Pollo Frito ($23). I ordered the half a chicken portion that was cut into four individual pieces with a sweet and spicy chili sauce drizzle. The three day preparation, including brining, steaming and frying, gave the chicken a nice crispy skin, but kept the meat especially moist. The chili drizzle did not detract from the crispness of the skin, and actually highlighted the juiciness of the meat.

The dish is usually accompanied with corn bread and chipotle creamed spinach. The spinach is somewhat liquidy from the cream without being watery. In addition, the spinach has a pleasant heat and is a great rendition of a classic dish. This time I decided to substitute esquites, or Mexican street corn, in place of the spinach. The esquites complemented the cornbread nicely, and the corn was not overcooked. It maintained a small bit of crunch, and an overall richness from the cream, and a subtle background like flavor. of lime. There was no overt heat in the corn, which was a bit of a relief from the spiciness of the meal. The corn had an amazingly addictive quality to it though, and made me come back more and more. The dusting of cotija on top was a nice garnish. The cornbread had chunks of fresh corn throughout, and generous pad of melted butter. It came out as an individual loaf--freshly baked and hot from the oven.

Xochitl has a great vibe--perfect for an intimate dinner or a group night out. Next time Im there, I'm going to try the Chocolate Tres Leches Cake--as long as I have enough room left in my stomach!",2015-05-13 20:18:23,

Sure El Rey is delicious, but their prices are pretty high unless you go to their happy hour which is usually so packed you can barely get an order in. I've gone to this place twice after church, and have enjoyed it both times. I think I might have found a new Sunday tradition.

Ambiance: A pretty small joint with bright colors that really liven up the room. While the restaurant can only sit about ~20 people, the lively colors and open garage door window really opens up the place. 

Food: $9 for three tacos and a side of chips might seem expensive, but they are loaded up with the protein of your choosing. You can choose your topping too, but don't go overboard aka keep it simple, stupid. These tacos only need a few things: a bit of salsa, pickled onions, and maybe some lettuce if you are into that. Sure you can pile on cheese, guac, and sour cream but you will lose the flavor of the meats.

Speaking of which, the al pastor is by far the best option. They have it on a spit and slice it off fresh and sear it each time you order. You get just the right amount of citrus in each bite. The carnitas are good, but if you want to go with pork, stick with the al pastor. The short rib barbocoa is super juicy and savory, but can be too heavily salted for some people.

Service: Since this is a fast-casual restaurant, service is pretty much limited to that behind the counter. All the employees I've interacted with have been considerate and kind, especially when I ask for more toppings.

Drinks: Selection of American and Mexican coke/soda products, so no complaints here. If you need water, you can ask and the employees can bring you a glass for free.",2018-05-30 19:21:53,"{'food': ['tacos', 'al pastor', 'carnitas', 'short rib barbocoa'], 'drink': ['coke', 'soda']}"

I had been to the former restaurant, Chaucer's, once before, and the transformation was drastic. Pub and Kitchen has been able to achieve lighting nirvana in their small space, creating a warmth that filters throughout. Service was quick and attentive without being overbearing. But on to the food.

I highly recommend trying the Bar Snacks, which are a steal at $3 a pop. We sampled the duck liver pate and fish mop rolls. The latter were delicious. If memory and taste serve me correctly, it was some kind of white fish combined with a creme fraiche accompanied by potatoes and herbs on crusty bread, all of which is underscored by a hint of citrus. The flavors are sophisticated and complex. Two large pieces come to an order.

Entrees: I was in the mood to go light, so I ordered the onion soup ($8) with a side of brussels sprouts ($5). What made the onion soup distinct was the addition of some kind of wheat beer (I think) to the broth, which stood up to the strength of the cheese and paired well with the sweet, caramelized onions. My only complaint: some of the cheese on top of the soup burned at the edges under the broiler. My side of brussels didn't achieve as high marks. The brussels were overcooked as well as the accompanying bacon. The flavors hit the mark, blending well, but the execution fell short.

We had also ordered the fish and chips, an altogether unspectacular dish, especially considering the steep price tag: $16-18 (don't remember exactly). The chips lacked a certain crispness, adding to the overall ineptitude. Also ordered was the steak and potatoes ($22). Not more perfectly could the steak be cooked! Rare, au poivre, and blissful. Not as much could be said of the potatoes, done in a hash brown/latke style, which seemed old and overdone.

In all, a pleasurable experience with exceptional flavor and ambiance; however, echoing other reviews, the actual cooking has yet to find its groove. Potatoes and brussels, especially at this price point, should be done without error. This has yet to happen.

To sit at the bar with a drink and ""bar snack"" before venturing out for the evening--yes, this would be delightful and really the most prudent of actions.

The tacos were tasty , the tofu alone seemed a bit bland because well, it had nothing on it. The accompanying sides on the taco were tasty and helped tremendously. 

The soft serve was do it yourself ( meaning Liam got a lot for the 3$ that it cost ) not sure if you can go back for more once you're done like you can with like drinks. 

They serve alcohol ( lots o tequila !!! )

When we first walked in I noticed only one family eating in the restaurant. Anyway we decided to order seafood delight with brown rice, vegetable lo mien and a half peking duck with sticky buns.  First of all seafood delight was served on a sizzling skillet which cooled down quickly. Also, it was served with a small portion of brown rice. Maybe its my fault I should have known it was an individual portion and not served family style.  The lo mien was Ok but again it was a small portion.  All of this would have been OK but the peking duck was the worst. I was really looking forward to the sticky buns and to my surprise when the duck came out it was served with cold flour tortillas! When we finished my Mom was still hungry and wanted to order more food (we are not really big eaters).  One saying grace were the fortune cookies that we enjoyed with our hot tea.

Mason jar appetizers were interesting and, seemingly, pricey at $8.50 yet actually a  good value because they were well and carefully crafted from delicious ingredients.  Salads were large and had so many great ingredients and just the right amount of excellent dressing.

The short-rib grilled-cheese sandwich was good, the meat tender, with a jam, but lacked a bit of acid or horseradish (but their horseradish cream is too understated -- it came with another diner's jar of beet salad, so I sampled a little).  (I took half the sandwich home to try to perk it up with pickles, or a Siracha ketchup.) 

Others in our party had salads of various kinds, and loved them.  The grilled chicken on one was perfectly cooked, the dressing ""delectable"".

Their great weakness in accommodating wheat/gluten or other allergies definitely hurts and limits this restaurant.  The server knew the beers well, but not food menu ingredients.  And the restaurant's ""accommodation"" of serving a ""sandwich without the bread"" just doesn't cut it any more.  It's just too easy to have a loaf of GF bread and some rice flour on hand to use as needed.  It's customer focused which makes it good for business.  (Didn't even bother to see if they had GF beers, of which there are several good ones out there.)  14% or more of the population has issues with wheat, among other ingredients so that's a big potential clientele to be dismissing.

Took a butterscotch pudding home, to enjoy over several nights, but the taste was off -- possibly from the very large plastic container they put the small dollop into.  Smelled kind of like dishwater.  Perhaps enjoyed on premises, it would taste far better.

The sushi was very meh the first time, but my roommate and I decided to give them one more try based on reviews. I think a lot of people leaving the good reviews have never had good sushi because Makiman is definitely sub par. 

Anyway, the second time I ordered some kind of fancy/special shrimp tempura roll and a salmon avocado roll.

Warm raw fish is not good and it grossed me out to where I couldn't eat it. I could have let this slide, but they also gave me a regular shrimp tempura roll instead of the one I ordered and paid for that cost double. I gave them a call about the roll and mentioned the warm salmon. The guy was super rude and told me that he's ""been packaging sushi for 10 years and no one ever complained about this."" Ok, jerk.

He told me he would credit the extra $7 for the shrimp tempura from my next order. Told him there would be no next order after the conversation we just had and he said OK and hung up.",2013-12-08 18:16:37,"{'food': ['sushi', 'shrimp tempura roll', 'salmon avocado roll'], 'drink': []}"

I love their food so much my fiancé gave me a 40$ gift card to this location. I normally frequent the one on 40th and walnut (so often that they know my name and order) and the people have always went above and beyond at that location. However, today I went to the Rittenhouse location and after ignoring me for five minutes, the lady wound up taking my order. I ordered 3 items off the menu and I tried to use my gift card. At first it got declined and then a manager came over. She checked my balance and it said 0.00$!!! I was devastated. Since my fiancé doesn't really lie to me (why would he in this situation?) I am left to believe that when he bought the gift card, the worker pocketed the cash and never loaded the gift card. I'm very upset because I love the food so much, but this is unacceptable. They have lost a loyal customer and I will also warn others about the dishonest workers at this location.",2017-07-31 23:08:37,

I thought from the look of the outside that it was going to be a PF Changs kind of deal, which is a big NOPE for me. If that's your bag, cool, but I prefer more authentic when I can get it. However, at the voice of a friend, I decided to give it a try. 

I got the pork belly double-cooked style, and the taiwanese sausage. The sausage is pretty much exactly what you'd expect, the sweet sausage that you find at Asian groceries, but paired with freshly sliced garlic which took it to another level.

The pork belly was a little drier than I expected. It didn't have exactly the melt in my mouth texture that I tend to associate with pork belly. The sauce, though a little oily, was flavorful and complex. They rated the spice at a four, but honestly I found it pretty mild. I would've put it more at a one or a two.

Despite those few minor nitpicks, this is definitely a place I intend to bring my husband back to to try more things. Maybe next time I'll try the rabbit.",2013-11-16 19:03:52,"{'food': ['pork belly', 'Taiwanese sausage'], 'drink': []}"

First off, it is in a great location (Rittenhouse Square). It was very conscience that to hop on an elevator, walk a few feet, and end up here. Second of all, the restaurant seems to get some traffic for the bar as well (a plus, because you know it's a popular spot). We both ended up ordering the house salad, which was delicious for a salad (I'm not really a salad person). The fact that I enjoyed it says a lot. I ended up ordering the split cut prime rib (medium rare). My mom ordered the prix fixe prime rib got two sides along with it (corn and mashed potatoes). The prime rib was delicious and perfectly cooked. Additionally, our waiter George was phenomenal. We ended our meal with desserts. We left stuffed, and with leftovers!
