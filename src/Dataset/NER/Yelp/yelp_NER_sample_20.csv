The lunch menu wasn't enormous, but large enough and contained so many delicious sounding things that it took forever to decide. Prices ranged from $7 to $13 per dish.

With such amazing options, I oddly opted for the Local Burger. WOW. A perfectly cooked medium patty, on a Challah roll, with Philly Pale Ale onions and Gruyere cheese. Delicious. It also came with a generous side of fries that were quite delicious.

The beer selection was pretty nice, flowing from your popular macro-brews to locals and macro-brews. Average about $5.50 per pint.

There were very few customers in there at the time, but I suppose we were a little late for the lunch rush. The music was a notch above too low and was a mix of modern, up beat tunes ranging from electronic to modern rock. Even heard some Gogol Bordello!

Our waitress was really perfect, always there at the right moment, helpful and cheerful. Really could not ask for better service. 
For $45 for a four course dinner on south broad you really can't complain too much. But you can eat better than this. Several dishes were over salted or over spiced. Grilled octopus really doesn't need all that spice to be good, just grill it properly and dress it with a bit of oil and salt and it's amazing. Overcook it and overspice it, and it doesn't work. 
Greek salad was delicious.

This was great advice! The food was delicious, the experience is a lot of fun, and the price cannot be beat. (Believe me, I made a lot of phone calls when planning this dinner ... nobody else even came close!)

While the restaurant has a full bar, they also allow you to BYOB with no fee. They brought us a cooler for the wine and glasses right away and were very patient as it took quite a while for our whole group to arrive. At the beginning of the meal, your hands are washed with rosewater - this is not just a nice touch, but necessary since you'll be eating with your hands! We then enjoyed 5(+) excellent courses ... the menu has stayed the same since my last visit 5 years ago, so I'll let you read other reviews for a detailed description. Suffice it to say that the food is still delicious! I am so grateful that our group spanned 2 tables, because any time there were two options we ordered one of each and shared. They were also vegetarian-friendly and provided meat-free options to the vegetarians in our group seamlessly!

I went with a couple of friends, one Malaysian and one familiar with Southeast Asia. Having someone from Malaysia order and explain more about Malaysian culture definitely enriched our experience. For example, Penang's open kitchen mirrors Malaysia's open kitchens found in most authentic local restaurants.  

When we were there, we ordered many of Malaysia's national dishes - nasi lemak, beef rendang, chow keoh tow, and roti chanai. All of them definitely lived up to expectations, as they had the right amount of spice, and soy sauce. 

The Nasi Lemak, this time around, did not have the traditional coconut rice it should come with, but despite that the meat, the dried fish, and all the usual condiments were true to Malaysian culture, that you'd hope to see. 

The beef rendang was very flavorful, having been slow-cooked for over seven hours in order to truly make the test of the marinade and sauce show through. 

The chow keoh tow was a noodle dish with bean sprouts, seafood, and other vegetables. It had a strong hint of soy sauce, and was definitely a Chinese-influenced dish. 

The roti canai reminded me of a flat croissant, it had the flakiness you'd associate with a croissant though less buttery. It was a dipped in a curry-like sauce with a lot of beef, potatoes, among many other things in it.

Once we got inside the place seemed friendly, but the intensely hipster waitstaff didn't seem overly attentive. The waitress didn't let me order the chicken fried steak fingers off the kid's menu even though I was willing to pay more (it was the novelty, not the cost). She flat out told me that it didn't even taste good. 

So what did I do? I got the regular order of chicken fried steak and proved her RIGHT...because it was terrible.  Chewy, soggy, and the gravy was a sloppy mess of thickened, flavorless cream.

So what about it wasn't great, you are wondering? 

I hate to say this but the hostess right when we walked in. There were actually two of them. And they were confusing. They told us there was a 30 minute wait so we gave them a name, and a number and we told them we would wait. Obviously, or we wouldn't have given them the name and number. So they told us to wait and something about a party of six coming in and having a reserved table. 

Anyway we went to the back to get something at the bar while we wait but the bar was full. So the other hostess ushered us over to this back bar style table, which I noticed was already set for six. So I assumed it was for the table of six that we were told about. 

So in my head, we would have a drink and wait for the next table. It was confusing. I felt weird sitting at someone else's table. But we ordered drinks and I thought maybe the party of six wasn't for another hour or something. 

So the waitress, who was totally sweet, came back with our drinks and asked us if we knew what we wanted to eat or if we needed a minute and I was just like wait what's going on here? Was this our table? Or were we waiting? If the hostess seated us here, why did she take my name and number?

It was so weird and I felt stupid but I had to ask the waitress if the table was reserved or not. And she looked at me funny and said no of course not. She smiled and said if it was reserved I wouldn't be taking your order and waiting on you at it. Which really was cute and funny.

I really want to love this place.  I've come back four times since my initial review.  Each time I wait at least 20 minutes to sit down, which I'm okay with since all the great brunch nooks have a mandatory wait.

What I don't like, is that each time I sit down, I wait like crazy for my food.  I'm not sure if it's personal, but each time I've come, we sat down before some groups and way before other groups but we inevitably get our food last.  A few months ago we waited so long after others got their food that I think the waiter felt bad and brought us a complimentary bowl of Tim Tams (which are delicious - I highly recommend them as a snack).

We went last weekend.  The line was long so I got a coffee and tea while we waited to sit, I was just dying for the coffee and couldn't wait another 20 minutes for it.

We sat down and ordered immediately.  A few minutes later, a four top sat in front of me.  A few minutes after that, another couple sat on my right.  

Then we waited....

The couple to my right got their food.  The four top then got their food.  A fifth person joined them right after and placed an order.  We waited... the fifth person then got their food.  Our waitress hadn't even been back to our table.

The couple to my right finished and got their bill... still no food.  The four-top did the same, then our food came.  By then, I was cranky and starving so I just angrily shoveled my food down.

Our waitress then promptly brought the bill and totally didn't care.  I still tipped her 20% out of fear of getting worse service if I do go back.

That puts me in quite a pickle, living in Philly and all.

From a pushy server to mediocre-at-best dishes, Penang was a less than stellar dining experience.

To start, the satay chicken and beef were chewy and dry. The peanut sauce was lacking in flavor but generous with grease. The entrees were equally disappointing, but at least the nasi lemak proved better than the rest. Much like the appetizers, the beef rendang were tough and next to impossible to chew. As for the ""king pork buff"", I think a more appropriate name for the dish would have been ""king pork flop."" Similar to jing du pork chops in presentation, the bbq sauce simply flopped in the piquant nature of the original dish.

Dessert -- ABC shaved ice -- was aesthetically pleasing but disappointingly tasting. In fact, I couldn't find half of the ingredients listed on the menu in the bowl.

While we debate the ""savings"" of the prix fixe offerings it got us out to dinner here sooner than later (normal menu pricing would not have deterred a visit.)  What a surprise. Great relaxed vibe, attentive, friendly service and contemporary Latin decor.

The bar and dining area on the main floor is cozy, could seem tight if the place was packed but not claustrophobic. Except the water closet - and I say W.C.

Now the food, it was delish. Nothing disappointed from the contemporary Mexican offerings. We started with the table-side prepared quac which was very fresh and tasty. Next were the ceviche de fluke (light and refreshing) and cazuela de chorizo y papas (bold, spicy and a nice compliment to the kale - only way I'll eat kale in the future :-) Third course we dined on the falda de res (flank steak cooked to medium with a great sear around) and carnitas de puerco (tender, melt in your mouth pork cheeks.) All topped off with cajeta cheese cake (from goats milk - you'd have to like goat's milk cheese or it may be too assertive in flavor but rich and creamy just the same) and churros (accompanying Mexican hot chocolate which was rich in flavor but not as thick as the pudding-like variety of Spain.)

Overall a great experience and am looking forward to returning and trying a tequila flight and some other menu items. Contrary to some other recent reviews we had no service issues.

I've used the computer to check prices, but it's slow and really not worth it.  If you go, go because they offer a GREAT selection of beer including many 1.6 pint bottles for a quick fix.

Premium price for a great selection that's on my way home from work isn't too bad in my book.

Went at 9 AM on a Sunday, got 1 fig-on-fig, 1 indian cinnamon, and 1 strawberry rhubarb donut.  The indian cinnamon was 1 of 3 donuts they make hot upon request, the other 2 were part of the pre made batch that runs out eventually.

The hot donut was one of my favorite cake donuts ever -- moist, tasty, and the indian cinnamon spice complemented the donut flavor well.  The fig-on-fig had a good subtle fig flavor.  The strawberry rhubarb was good but a bit sweet for my taste.

Returned at 11:45, got a number and waited until 12:20 for my half order of fried chicken with Zatar spice. The spices were ok but the  chicken was dry. Compared to other fried chicken this one ranks medium-low on taste and high on hype.

There is a bar adjacent to the host area with limited seating and the general dining area is inviting but not pretentious. The restaurant isn't overly spacious and though our table was a bit small it was nicely located near a window. 

The service was attentive and the pace was good. 
The menu features a variety of appetizers, pasta, entrees, and vegetable sides, many of which seem to be comfort food or southern inspired dishes. 

We enjoyed the Parker House Rolls, served in a cast iron skillet and accompanied with chive butter. They were tasty and a nice starter.

The caramelle pasta was probably the least inspired. Although it was nicely presented the portion was minimal and though the butter sauce was warm, the pasta twists themselves were cold which was somewhat off putting. 

The highlight of the meal was actually the seasonal chicken. I'm not a huge fan of chicken but this chicken was fried in buttermilk, boneless, and was soft and flavorful. The accompanying grits were a bit heavy on the butter, but okay. The collard greens were fine, the comeback sauce was well prepared. 

For a side vegetable we tried the torched broccoli with hot sauce. The presentation was a little unsightly, it was more like broccoli tossed haphazardly in sauce, but it was tasty. 

Our drinks were good, the restaurant has a good enough variety of cocktails, wine and other libations to get along with, though I wouldn't characterize the pours as particularly generous for some of the prices. 

Our dessert consisted of the Dirt Sundae, of chocolate mousse and topped with crushed cookies/fruit. The presentation was nice and the mousse was well flavored and a good way to conclude the meal.

When I walked in, I actually liked the cafeteria style long tables, it made me feel like I was in for a NYC fine pizza experience.  Even ordering an overpriced, lightweight, 500 ml carafe of their house Sangiovese made the anticipation climb...pizza and red, can't get better than that, right?

We had the Heirloom tomato salad to start.  I'd have to say the baby kale was tender and not bitter, with a nice balsamic reduction.  The tomatoes were average in taste and the small ones, not the meaty heirloom tomatoes to which one may be accustomed.  And the flatbread served with the salad was totally worthless, dry, stale, tough to chew.

Then came the bubble buster, the friggin pizza.  We ordered the  Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, mozzarella and tomato sauce).  If there was 3 oz of sausage on the entire pizza, I would be surprised.  Other than a couple sprigs of fennel for decor, the roasted fennel was absent any taste, let alone a roasted flavor.  The tomato sauce was nice and light.  But the beautiful looking thin crust was soooooo soggy, you couldn't lift it up, it required a knife and a fork.  Wet crust sucks!!!!!!!!!

There is a way to avoid that from happening, serve it on a raised mesh screen, this will prevent the crust from steaming.

This is a great place to host large parties, but it can be difficult to find. It's located inside a furniture gallery, on one of the higher floors. Locating the elevators was an issue and slightly scary, since all the stores were closed at night.

The food itself was not bad. The set was $60 / person. This may have included venue fees as well as 1-2 drinks / person. I chose the set with salad (not too memorable), scallops w/ risotto (really good!!), and a chocolate mousse dome dessert (too heavy / rich).

Since I already had dinner before coming, I only ate the salad and dessert, and took the scallop and risotto home. But even reheated in a toaster over the scallop was delicious! It is easy to overcook scallops, so I usually enjoy them at restaurants. My only problem with the scallop dish is that the sizes are sooo unequal between dishes. I got lucky and got two really large pieces. Other people had 2 scallops which equalled the size of one of mine... I know scallops cannot be perfectly identical in size, but that variation is just wayyy too big, must be statistically significant. I felt really bad for them.

I actually have very indifferent feelings towards the Rittenhouse HCV (everything there for me has been good but not FANTASTIC,) so I was expecting the same 'okay' quality. Walking in, the UCity location has a much nicer interior with a lot more space for people to sit. It's lush and green and really lovely inside, and, like the other HCV, you order at the front and the waitstaff will bring your order to you. 
I ordered the Crispy HipCity Ranch--a staple at the Rittenhouse location--to see how it would compare.
It was WAY BETTER than the Crispy HipCity Ranches I've had at the other location! The 'chick'n' was indeed crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, the vegetables were fresh, the ranch sauce super flavorful, and the bread soft and very good at bringing everything together. I went during opening week, so the sandwich was put together a bit weirdly (everything fell apart immediately,) but it was still absolutely delicious. My friends ordered the Bistro Bella and Philly Steak and they loved their meals as well. We wanted to order a groothie or another drink / side, but they were incredibly overpriced, so we passed. The service was a bit awkward and HCV was clearly overstaffed for the number of people actually eating there, but we still had a good experience.
Overall! This HipCityVeg is a welcome addition to the UCity food community, if you can afford it (I need to not go there every week and blow my bank account...).

Their instagram page updates the new flavor, so that's how I check what's new but you can always ask if there's anything for special over the phone and the host/ess always answers me in detail. 

The decor inside is super casual hangout spot sort of feel. Kind of small, but waitstaff is very friendly and fast. Also the Metro, the large pizza, is a gigantic rectangular pizza that prob can feed 3-4 people. The regular round pie is just enough for 2 if an app or dessert is ordered. Although, we always end up getting one small pizza per person and just pack the leftovers. These surprisingly taste pretty decent even when cold or microwaved. 

Anyways, highly recommend if you're looking for a casual hangout spot with buddies or slightly fancier late night grub over za and wine / beer.",2017-03-21 03:52:14,"{'food': ['pizza', 'burata', 'truffled white leek pizza', 'roasted potatoes', 'corned beef', 'pickled cabbage'], 'drink': ['beer', 'wine']}"

It actually felt kind of homey, it was nice on a cold rainy night.
So why does this place get 4 stars? The food. The food was absolutely fantastic. My friends I was with were vegetarians so we got mostly veggie food. I got just basic rice and lentils. The lentils were nice and buttery but not too much and seasoned very well. My friend got this cauliflower stew which was great as well.

It's funny how you measure relationships. Justin, ramen and I have come a long way. I remember the first time we went to Toki (http://www.yelp.com/biz/toki-underground-washington?hrid=kHY3lSf2_8_Kz7fbNNQdQQ) together to get ramen. His proposal to go grab noodle soup was somewhat appalling but I really liked him so I didn't want to outright reject the idea. I was also pretty drunk so I went with it, heh. I ate some of the noodles and picked out a lot of the meat from the bowl that we shared. That was a big hint that he liked me too; if a man who loves meat as much as Justin does lets you steal all of his pork cheek, you must be special.

Nowadays Justin, ramen and I are like a happy but dysfunctional family. Ramen and I don't always get along but when we do, we really do, and Justin is the go between to make sure we get along. It's true love when Justin will find a way to go eat at a new ramen place without me as a taste test before he determines if I'll like it and can take me there. May sound odd but it means I don't have to eat gross food. I should have added ""boyfriend is a ramen taste tester"" to my list of things I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving.

Justin and I had both researched where to eat in Philly and dinner on our first night was to be at Khmer Kitchen. However, our late lunch pushed dinner back a bit and when we arrived, just past 8:30pm, they had just stopped seating for dinner. We looked through our bookmarks and headed towards Cheu which wasn't too far away and was still open. Plus, it wasn't much further to Monk's which was our final destination for the evening. Even on a Friday night without reservations the wait wasn't too long. They actually quoted us a much longer wait time than it was and in the 15 or 20 minutes we waited on the bench outside the door we laughed at all of the people coming up expecting a table immediately. A bunch of normal people with a ""do you know who I am"" type of attitude annoyed that they couldn't immediately get a seat in a small highly rated restaurant. 

We were seated at the counter right in front of the bar with adorable cartoon-decorated lamps above. We had a great view of the open kitchen and I was very impressed at how efficiently the two in the kitchen worked, and even more so that the chef was a woman (I don't understand why females are so underrepresented in the culinary world). Not only did the duo quickly put out good food that was well presented, but they did it all while managing takeout orders as well. Cheu is a bit too fusion-y for the type of ramen I like but the food was still decent. We ordered the daily dumplings (one type per day, four dumplings served in chili oil for $5). Not bad but I was still too full from lunch and was hoping that I'd like the ramen (ya know, since Justin hadn't tried it out for me yet) so I just ate one and gave my other one to Justin who happily finished it. Round two was the brisket ramen (with matzo ball, kimchi, sesame chili broth for $13). I think the dumplings ended up being the better part of the meal though since the matzo ball in the ramen was just texturally weird to me. The broth was well developed though and I think I'd like their product more if I'd had more traditional option. That being said, I'm rounding up from 3.5 stars because I get the sense that Cheu doesn't give a shit if people like their fusion food or not, they're gonna do what they want, and I respect that.",2014-11-21 12:40:21,"{'food': ['dumplings', 'brisket ramen'], 'drink': []}"

That's how I'd begin to explain ""how this restaurant was"" to friends that ask, followed by a long pause.

A groupon deal came out for Bistro St. Tropez, and after checking it out online I decided to purchase it.

Had a dinner and a movie date planned out, so I arrived at the restaurant around 6:30pm.

First thing that put me off was the location of this place. It's located in this big commercial building on one of the top floors. I saw the sign of the restaurant upon exiting the elevator. Followed it, then all I saw was an outdoor looking patio, except it wasn't outdoors, it was situated on carpet. It's exterior felt like a mall cafe and so extremely out of place.

We were approaching the restaurant with another really dressed up couple who signed up for the groupon deal, and we stood awkwardly staring and saying ""uh... is this... it?"".

Finally someone came to get us (ha!) and it turned out to be a really cute and cozy place inside! 

Our waiter was extremely nice, funny and on point about everything. Service was absolutely excellent.

We went along with the three course meal. You have the option of choosing your appetizer, entree, and desert.

The bread rolls they give out while you wait for your food came with an amazing fresh pesto sauce.

My downfall from this pleased mood started when I picked the smoked corn soup to start. It tasted like pureed baby food. I'm not sure if any other yelpers out there felt this way towards it, but my date felt the same way. 

For my entree, I had the salmon with pesto, wrapped in phyllo. I am a HUGE fan of phyllo, so this really got 5 stars for me. Cooked fabulously and was sitting under a butter sauce and paired with asparagus, which happens to be my favorite vegetable!

My date had the steak and frites, and it came in a big portion! Didn't expect it, only because upscale restaurants tend to downsize portions then charge the sh*t out of your meal. The meat was tender, juicy, and PERFECTLY cooked.

For my desert course, I picked the baked peach in lavender sauce, with what seemed like a hazelnut gelato on the side. I should have steered clear when I read lavender sauce. It tasted just like what it was... peach soaked in lavender. I'm not sure I enjoyed the taste of a flower, but if you do then go for it!

My date got the creme brulee, which was excellent. Some restaurants tend to butcher creme brulee, but Bistro St. Tropez did it justice- top was carmelized to perfection.

Overall, I would suggest the steak and frites entree, as well as the salmon with pesto wrapped in phyllo. 

I'd also suggest to skip out on the course deal and order a la carte, that way you can avoid the baby food soup and flower tasting peach.",2011-12-21 04:09:18,"{'food': ['salmon with pesto wrapped in phyllo', 'steak and frites'], 'drink': []}"

The bartender Molly is an absolute professional, and was kind enough to make me a virgin cocktail off menu. She also suggested their house salad, which may seem simple enough, but was a real hit. Chef Nolen has always mastered amazing textures in his salads, and the addition of peas and cucumber to a standard house salad was a delight. I also enjoyed the steak tartare appetizer, which, covered in egg with crunchy chips and baguette slices, was awesome. Tartare done well is a joy! Pro Tip: Get the maple custard desert. Jess Nolen hit the ball out of the park on this one. Walnut crumble, rich yet light texture, and prepared to perfection. 

What sets Whetstone apart from other local places is their attention to detail. The design of the place allows one to peek into the half-open kitchen (as us foodie-voyeurs like to), the sleek bar is welcoming and warm, and the beautiful old whetstone above the visible cheese cooler is a nice touch. What I really like is Chef Nolen's charcuterie slicer right next to the bar and the host stand; we were able to casually chat about cheeses as he meticulously sliced (what I think was) speck or prosciutto.

They really set up a great local place here with a top notch staff, great pricing, and a comfortable atmosphere to enjoy the eats! You'd be silly not to check it out.

Salaw Machu Kreung (lemongrass soup with slices of beef lungs)
Pleah Sach Ko (Raw beed salad)
Prah Hok Kateeh (ground beef marinated with fermented fish served with vegetables)
Mussels with coconut sauce
Mussels with curry sauce
Frog meat with vegetables (Forgot the name)
Kah-Puh Chin (Fried shrimp with some sort of mayo/sriracha sauce)
Cooked (Grilled?) beef with fermented fish sauce
Some sort of chicken dish I totally forgot

Out of these dishes, my favorites are: Kah-Puh Chin, Prah Hok Kateeh, and the grilled beed with fermented fish sauce, and the raw beef salad.

My least favorite was the mussels with the curry sauce, which was surprising because I totally thought I'd like it based off how delicious it looks from other people's pictures.

It was my first time eating frog as well.  It wasn't too bad; it was like chewy chicken meat.  It was also my first time eating raw beef. Again, I was surprised I liked it.

Now make no mistake, Cambodian food is completely different from other Asian dishes.  I don't know how to describe it, but it's a more ""ethnic/heavy"" tasting.  The dishes use a lot of lemongrass.  Khmer Kitchen is authentic Cambodian food, but it's slightly on the sweeter side, according to one friend who just came from Cambodia. The food is still delicious, though!  If you're new to Cambodian food, I'd recommend the Prak Hok Kateh or Kah-Puh Chin.

We ordered the shrimp pil pil and grilled octopus appetizers, then split the whole grilled sea bass. The shrimp pil pil is a dish of shrimp lightly dusted in flour then cooked in a cherry pepper and garlic paste. In general, I find it blasphemy to coat seafood and fry it, but this shrimp was an exception. It has a nice crispy crunch on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside and smothered in a delicious, flavorful paste. This is not a dish for those who do not like garlic.

The grilled octopus was exactly what you would imagine. Fresh octopus grilled and served in a lemony light sauce. Sauce might be stretching it, as it was more of a clear broth. Anyway, it was pretty good but I still preferred the shrimp pil pil. (Note: I recently had the octopus dish at LIttle FIsh so with such an outstanding dish in recent memory, it is not surprising that Dmitri's octopus would pale in comparison.)

For the entree, we had the grilled sea bass. I love whole fish. The fish was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully. The rice and escarole sides were unmemorable, just as other reviewers commented.

Finally, the pita bread they served was delicious. I loved the taste of the smoky grill on the bread, although I have to admit the interior tasted almost gummy like it was just a minute or 2 undercooked (underbaked?). The ""baguette"" should not even be served at all. It tasted like mediocre italiam bread in the shape of a baguette.

Even though my review and rating was supposed to be solely based on the food, I feel I should comment on the atmosphere. My recommendation is to avoid this place on a busy night.

Even though half my family tree is rooted in Thailand, not Cambodia, the flavor profile and hominess of the dishes at Khmer Kitchen deeply resonate with me.

He will let you know with pride what special dishes grandma and her team of children (his aunts and uncles) are cooking that night.

As is always the case with home cooking, there are always a few imperfect dishes that you don't ask your parents to make when you visit home. I am not a huge fan of the seafood dishes, namely the curry mussels and fried fish. Also, the lemongrass stir-fry was too mild in flavor for me.

First and foremost, this is absolutely a Hipster dive, so if you have an aversion to the casually ironic, stay away...it will only get your blood up and probably dull the taste buds just a little bit.

Anyway, looking at their menu, it is clear that there is a great amount of thought placed on taste and variety, two things that absolutely make it hard to make a choice when it's your first and probably only chance to sample the offerings. 

I settled on the Challah French Toast with Home Fries and their locally-purchased bacon. Add to that an absolutely delicious fresh-squeezed Limeaid that more than hit the spot.

First and foremost, major props for serving hot maple syrup with their pancakes and french toast, that is a special touch that you don't really get most other places. Add to that the fact that they gave a generous amount, guaranteeing that the maple flavor is absolutely present. I dug that.

The Challah French Toast was light, airy and very delicious. Three slices of this thick bread are more than enough to satisfy even the hungriest of diner. Very good choice here.

The Home Fries, made with peppers and onions were just as delicious, although I wish the portion was slightly larger. $2.50 for a modest saucer is a bit much; I would have happily paid an extra buck for a larger portion.

But by far, the absolute best part of the meal was the Lancaster County Country Bacon, which without fillers and emulsifiers, made for an excellent slice of bacony heaven. Cooked just right, with a good amount of thickness, it was a highlight of the meal.

Must admit that I wasn't a fan of the Cash Only rule, but as the ATM located in the shop had a relatively low fee ($1.50), I'm not going to let it ding the overall experience. 

One last thing: I tried a bit of the Potato Latke, and I must say...I wasn't nearly as impressed as everyone else here seems to be. It was on the dry side, and not as savory as I would have liked. If you have to choose between the Latke and the Home Fries, absolutely go for the Home Fries.

My days started and ended with La Colombe's cappuccino, enjoyed in either the Rittenhouse Square or the cafe itself. I've found only one other cafe, Cafe Trieste in Berkeley, whose cappuccino matches La Colombe's.

At first, I only studied at La Colombe. (To be honest, I still haven't found another cafe where I feel comfortable studying as I had at La Colombe. Must be something about their seating...) As I became a regular, I found myself drawn into intriguing conversations. La Colombe remains my dream cafe: an excellent team of baristas serving great beverages to interesting patrons studying, reading, doing crossword puzzles, drawing, and engaging in witty conversations.

******************

In reading the reviews thus far, it seems there has been plenty of coverage about the coffee but only mostly negative feedback for the cafe. So here's my lowdown. Decide what you will:

*Opens and closes early: 7am-6pm ish. There are usually a handful of people already waiting at the door before the barista is ready to open. On the weekends!
*The baristas are amazing. The best I've seen anywhere. Incredibly efficient and fast! It helps that most patrons are regulars and know what they want. If you become a regular, the baristas will remember what you usually order and ask you if you want your usual. I varied and hence they never presumed. However, I've seen them notice regular patrons standing in line, serve up their drinks by the time the patrons reach the bar, and off the patrons simply pay and go. It reminded me of a well-choreographed dance. Tip them well if you become a regular. You may get free beverages and useful connections out of it.
*The baristas are all very attractive. They are all people who've other lives, for which networking at La Colombe comes in handy. They know who's who. I consider them to be, to some degree, involved in the weaving of a particular Philadelphian scene. They've never snubbed me. I've never seen them snub anyone. They've always been super professional and discrete.
*There is no menu. Can be intimidating for newcomers and those who like to know how much things cost. Order what you've liked elsewhere. The baristas will make most drinks people would ever want, and they'll let you know if they do not make/have a particular drink/ingredient. Just don't ask for soy milk. Skim is as far as they go. Remember, you're at a cafe owned by a Frenchman. Don't balk at the price. It'll be worth it.
*The iced cappuccino is crack.
*In terms of food, they only offer a limited quantity and variety of pastries. The almond croissants are fantastic. Less a fan of the scones. All can be gone by midday. There's a day (Mon?) when they have no pastries due to logistics. The baristas don't mind at all if you bring your own food. The regulars can be seen eating burgers from Loie's next door.
*Only cash.
*The place can get packed. Then, take your drink to go and stroll through Rittenhouse Square if you were planning on lingering. Or ask someone if you might share a table. People have always been obliging. Then, table hop when one becomes available. I've spent entire afternoons table hopping to my preferred spot or from one conversation to another.
*I tend to see two types of patrons: those who want conversations (i.e. are networking/socializing) and those who want to study. If you plan to study, don't sit near the front. Sit as far away from the bar and door as possible. Generally, although not always, this is where the studious sit whereas those who want conversation, the regulars, choose tables closer to the bar and the door. Invest in noise cancelling headphones, although they'll block out the music but definitely not conversations. If you're an attractive woman or man who comes regularly, the regulars will strike up conversations with you sooner or later. If you don't want that to happen, good luck.
*The baristas and the regulars are characters. Interesting to get to know. Consider yourself warned.

La Colombe Cafe off Rittenhouse Square can be more than just a cafe. Your experience of La Colobme, ultimately, is what you make of it. I chose to make it one of my networks/a scene. Those who prefer otherwise need not. But I do hope you'll really appreciate its contributions to the vitality of Philadelphia.",2007-07-25 06:19:43,

I'd heard Honey's name floating about for a while, so on last Saturday morning we went as a group of four to check it out.  I also knew from prior word-of-mouth that it was no reservations and that the line might be long.  When we got there there were people waiting outdoors.  I really liked the fact that Honey provided these heater lamps for the line outdoors - it was about 20F out.  We luckily got to wait just inside the door.. our wait was about 40-45 minutes.  Our waiter filled our coffee really quick and kept it filled our entire time.  Great service.  It was really busy but I never felt like our waiter was overwhelmed.

Every other aspect about that was superb. The servers were unobtrusive, were very prompt about refilling our water and wine glasses, and were really nice too. 

For the prices that they were charging, I expected the food to be out of this world and frankly, it wasn't. The maki roll that I ordered (I think it was the Paradiso roll?) was extremely salty, which is saying a lot since I salt EVERYTHING. The seaweed salad was SUPER fishy, which makes sense since yeah, it's seaweed, but I guess I'm just partial to the regular, not fancy kind. The sushi and sashimi combination dish that we got was infinitely better, but I feel like I could've had that same quality of dish elsewhere for cheaper. The one dish that stood out the most was the rock shrimp tempura with a wasabi aioli. It was PHENOMENAL. It wasn't super greasy and the tempura remained crisp the entire time, despite being tossed in the aioli. I would be tempted to go back again for that alone. 

Izumi, I really wanted to like you. It sucks living in South Philly because there isn't any sushi down here at all, and going to Vic's isn't always an option. But your food just isn't worth the price. Sorry :/

My sister and I shared the crispy artichokes for our appetizer. It wasn't very large, from what I remembered, but it was delicious, especially the lemony sauce it came with. It wasn't such a let down that the appetizer was small though, since we ordered a whole pizza to share between the two of us. It came out on a silver pizza platter, which the waitress balanced on an large, antique-y looking tomato can. I'm not sure why - perhaps to save table space - but it was still a charming presentation. We had a pizza with cippolini on it, so I'm assuming it's the mushroom pizza. It was great! We loved all the ingredients together on it, and we demolished the entire thing. For dessert, we shared an affagato - I think vanilla ice cream in espresso, if I remember correctly. It was a fitting end to the meal.

We came when it was not so busy and when the weather was lovely enough to sit outside, to be in full view of the river. Maybe avoid if it gets packed.

When you walk downstairs you are greeted by beautiful women who check your ID and coat. Their attire is sexy and maybe not be what a lot of people expect but this lounge is all about the experience. As
you move in further you feel like you're thrown into the set of The Great Gatsby. The music is a great remix of classics and top 40. There is plenty of space for large groups and to mingle with new people.
They mean for this lounge to be for the rich and successful (or really if you feel like dropping $100+ easily for a couple of drinks and small plates). The crowd is 30+.
The special drink menu has been carefully crafted although limited. Be warned that there aren't any prices on the menu but I can't imagine it's anything less than the ballpark of $20 per drink. Try the Fitzgerald and the Coco Chanel.

I went to dinner with a few friends to Eatalia and consider myself an EXTREMELY picky eater.  I was a little skeptical because I had yet to hear about the place and it's a little off the beaten path.  However, if I would recommend any Italian restaurant in the city, this would be one of them.  I have been to La Viola, Gnocchi, Porcini, Modo Mio, and all of the top Italian restaurants and I can honestly say the food here definitely competes with all of them.  

We started with the antipasta and I assure you it was extremely good and had an excellent variety.  Next was the crabcake.  I am extremely picky about crabcakes but this was EXCELLENT! Nice crisp outside and juicy lump crabmeat inside.  Definitely one of the best I have ever had.  From there, I had the Filet Mignon in a Fra Diavalo sauce.  I am sitting here today writing the review while craving their Fra Diavalo sauce.  EXCELLENT!

We finished off with the Tiramasu and loved it.  They also definitely get points for the presentation!

I think the difference between Eatalia and all of the other Philadelphia Italian BYOBs is that it really conveys that small, intimate setting that you crave when you go to an Italian restaurant.  The owner is waiting on tables, meeting with customers and makes you feel at home.   You feel welcome and are not just ""another"" customer!

The menu covers pretty much all the standard dishes subsumed under the catch-all term ""Indonesian"" and is broadly divided into noodle and rice plates, some organized in the fashion of a (modest) colonial Dutch rijstafel (a style of eating that allowed for sampling food from different areas).

We started with the egg noodle dish Mie Komplit, a combination plate that included BBQ pork, shredded chicken, vegetables, and eggs (hard boiled).  Rice platters we tried included the Rendang beef platter and a combination platter of various meats and vegetables.  The noodles were nicely prepared, as was the rice, and the diverse accompaniments tasty, if of somewhat differing quality (the pork belly had been around for a while).  The soups that came with these plates had a clean but thin chicken taste.  One minor quibble I have is that the temperature of the food was not as hot as I would have liked it to be.

All this delectable eating comes at astonishingly low prices.  The tea served is hot and always quickly replenished with another pot, the ice coffee serviceable.

We were welcome downstairs by a nice gentleman, and he got the elevator for us to go to the 37th floor. Looks like the rest of the building is for condominiums or offices, which require key cards to get in. 
Upon arrival upstairs, we were warmly greeted by two lovely ladies. And we got seated to our reserved window table. 
The view is very nice. The first thing we noticed is Philadelphia is flat. No hills, and no fog like San Francisco. A bit hazy, or is it pollution? 
Taylor was our server, she was extremely professional and courteous and friendly. The supporting staff too, but we failed to get their names. A lady we guessed was the manager came by and checked on how we were enjoying our meal too. 
The oysters were from Nova Scotia, and nothing to rave about. No flavor, no sweetness like Kumamoto or Kushi, or Malpeque.. we liked the hors d' oeuvres, compliments of the chef. It was something like a sea salt lavash bread with avocado. Very nice. 
The lobster looked good, but no dipping sauce and no lemon till we asked. The bone in rib eye was cooked to the desired temperature, but too fatty. This was not from a well marbled meat, it was just plain too much fat. The truffle sabayon was excellent though. The curry fingerling potatoes were good, the lobster Mac and cheese was over cooked, the cheese was a puddle of grease. 
We ordered the warm vanilla cake for dessert. Just great presentation, but meh on the taste.

It was not very crowded, which was good because the tables were practically on top of one another.  Besides the close seating the place was nice and comfortable while still feeling trendy.  The plates and mugs were pretty cool too - oblong shapes and interesting designs.

For apps, we split the lemon hummus and the petit salad.  I was bummed that the roasted squash soup that I saw on the online menu didn't make any reference to it having lobster in it.  Bummer.  The salad was boring.  The dressing was sweet and pleasant but other meh.  The hummus was delicious and the presentation in a glass jar with lemons was particularly attractive.

He got the creative It's Always Sunny Chicken Sandwich which has a crispy chicken breast, sunny side up egg, frisée, bacon-soy vinaigrette, and garlic parmesan fries.  There were two veg options: a roasted vegetable sandwich and a vegetable lasagna.  I was warned that the vegetable lasagna isn't a standard lasagna - there are no noodles or cheese, it's more like a thinly layered napoleon.  I went with this as I felt I could get a veggie sandwich anywhere.

His arrived on a big plate and looked really interesting.  He said it was good and the fries were quite nice as well.  

My face kind of dropped when mine arrived as it was a tiny square of layered vegetables and a small side of tabouleh.  Looking at some of the other tables, most meals were generous.  Mine was not.  At all.  It tasted fine, a little spicy actually, but otherwise just fine.

I was impressed by the size of the facility, which can hold over 200 people (at least). There was an outdoor cocktail reception and indoor dinner reception. 

The hors d'oeuvres were delicious, my favorite being the beef wellingtons! 

My cousin has impeccable taste. I was pleasantly surprised with the decor and dinner service. My guess is that I ate a mixed greens salad with rasberries and feta cheese with a vinaigrette..... i could be wrong, but it all melded together so well. There was also a choice of steak, fish or vegetarian. I opted for the steak. See the pictures! I Love potatoes so it was perfect for me.... steak, potatoes au gratin and snow peas.

Every time I've paid Tria a visit--and those visits have been varied, from afternoon shopping excursions to later-evening noshes to happy hour visits--the staff has known an excellent pairing for wine and cheese.  Part of the fun of visiting a place like Tria is experimenting with the pairings.  If you're not in the mood for heavy eating, but instead want to soak up the ambiance while nibbling at cheese and baguettes, Tria is your place. 

The food menu itself is rather simple, with fare like Smoked Chicken Salad and different sandwiches.  Tria seems to go with local or organic choices for some of its items.  No matter how much I've eaten at Tria or elsewhere, I always like the simple Nutella panini.  Sure, it scrapes the roof of your mouth, but chocolate can sometimes be pain.

The interior is warmly lit and inviting.  The only downside is the seating is limited.  If you want to sit outside, you're forced to sit next to a noisy street with little area for seating.  The servers always seem annoyed when they have to serve you outside as it's an endless trek up and down the front stairs.  Otherwise, the servers are great.  

Another thing to look out for is what Tria calls Sunday School.  Now, I don't know about you, but for me, Sunday School has an entirely different meaning.  For Tria, it means they highlight some cheese, wine, and beer choices, discount them, and give you a little lesson about them.

I had purchased a nice bottle of Chocarrubica that cost 25 dollars. When I got home, I went to drink it and confirmed with my wife (as she has an awesome palate for tasting) that the beer was in fact infected. I sent an e-mail telling them about this issue and never received any response. Then I e-mailed Brendan the regional manager for B. United International. He was swift and kind in taking up the task of solving this problem. He as well has e-mailed The Foodery, and thus far has not received an e-mail either. 

Now, folks, I would like to say first that I have a certain philosophy when it comes to money spending. Though I do not a make as much as I would like to (so I can start a bigger Italian beer collection!), I have no problems in spending money for a product I believe in.

So it saddens me that The Foodery does NOT have the passion or professionalism as does the company that provides the Italian beer. As someone who knows the ups and downs of the food/beverage/alcohol industry, as I myself have worked in it for over 15 years. This is a common problem in the alcohol industry: money can be made easily, but for those who enjoy the culture and taste of such products  are pushed aside by economic greed. And to think that beer had originals that were humble and in most cases, beer as food, in many of our cultures in this world.

Respectfully I do not suggest  coming here if in fact such a problem were to occur, it would not be solved. As a note, Brendan did not think ill of my e-mail in regards to this, as they take pride in their product, and their respect and love of the customers.

Oh and if you are like me and enjoy or are curious of Italian craft beer, the Wine Works in Marlton New Jersey is a GREAT stop!

A dinner at Mood was the end to an almost magical evening; I have never been so warmly welcomed or felt at home in a food establishment before. New to chaat and lassies, Hassan took out time just before he went on his break to teach us all about how to select a combination we'd like--and within my dietary restrictions. They were incredibly encouraging and so thoughtful--assuring us multiple times that if we didn't like it they'd find something we would enjoy. It was extremely reassuring as the choices were a bit overwhelming for two excited newbies looking to explore.

As other customers came in Daniel continued to share samples of their lassis--including new ones he made to experiment-- from beet/lemon/ginger to guava to strawberry/coconut/peanut butter. My boyfriend had the Mango (luscious, creamy); I was overjoyed with the insanely clean and sweet coconut. Both tasted incredibly fresh--though mine was more icy than smooth (perfect for the next day after a night in the freezer).

As for the chaat...it was wonderful! As everyone has noted it's nearly impossible to describe. I have many dietary restrictions (spicy, lactose, fried foods being among them) and was nervous, so chose the paneer. It was very different that I've had in other preparations, but delicious scrambled in combination with the beautifully sweet/salty/savory combinations of mint/raspberry/spicy sauces and I'm not even sure what else. My boyfriend--asking for the most authentic/spicy preparation-- had the chicken tikki (a bit too much sauce, but wonderfully hot).

Mood Cafe is a gem-- we stayed for over 2 hours chatting with Daniel and other regulars.

My boyfriend and I were craving Indian last night, and we live in the Mayfair section of Philly (read: Irish dive bars and pizza shops as far as the eyes can see, but not much else). After doing a Yelp search for Indian restaurants in the area, I decided to give Zaika a call since the ratings on here are great and I was taking a shot hoping they'd deliver.

Not only did they agree to deliver out of their zone for us, and read parts of the menu off to us because there's not one online other than the small snapshots people have taken, AND let us order under their delivery minimum, they also came with TASTY FOOD. DELICIOUS. The Korma was creamy, had those delightful bits of cashews and raisins in it, just enough heat to it, and really tender chicken. I hate when Indian places throw huge, dry cubes of chicken in there. These bits were perfectly braised. My boyfriend also loved the Tikka Masala, and both dishes had the perfect ratio of meat to sauce so there was plenty there for the dipping. The rice was just plain beautiful, and the naan was great too.

So, this experience sealed the deal for us, we'll now be regulars. In the future I plan to order and pick up on my way home from work in order to not send them out of their way again, as it's totally going to be worth it. Although, I do recommend that the owners consider extending their delivery range, and definitely get their menu up online (or even better, sign up with Grub Hub). They could probably make a killing, as not all of us in the Northeast are only interested in wings and cheap pizza. This gentleman was so appreciative for our business, and it was refreshing not only that they went out of their way for us, but that they also served up some really good quality food. 5++ stars.

The reason we decided to go there was due to a recommendation from a friend. We were not disappointed in any way! Parking was not a problem, we were fortunate to park on Market Street in front of the establishment. The restaurant is located on the 4th floor of a high end furniture showroom. As we approached the entrance to the restaurant you can actually see inside of the kitchen area. It looked well organized and extremely clean. We were met at the door and escorted to our table by a friendly host. The table had a spectacular view overlooking 30th Street Station, the Market Street Bridge & the Art Museum in the horizon. I was informed that this location is an excellent place to watch fireworks on the 4th of July. Our waiter (Matthew) treated us like rock stars. He was accommodating, provided us with detailed descriptions of the various entrees. The wine he paired with our meal was perfect.  The French rolls with pesto are amazing. The escargot are orgasmic in flavor!  We had the following entrees: Coquille ( pan seared scallops), Canard ( pan seared duck breast)  & Truite ( oven roasted rainbow trout). Everything was cooked to perfection! The food was phenomenal. Kudos to Chef Patrice for stopping by our table, making us feel like VIP's  He also gave us a complimentary glass of champagne, raised his glass and gave us an anniversary toast.

There are a variety of sauces depending on what you're in the mood for, but my two favorites are the pesto Parmesan and the honey mustard. 

The chicken is top notch in my opinion, albeit very expensive, however the mac and cheese was somewhat disappointing. It's packed with ingredients (sausage, peppers, herbs, cheese, etc) and almost has the consistency of stuffing. But all of the ingredients leave a mush of indistinguishable flavors.

- Pimento Cheese Stuffed Jalapeño (beer-battered, surprisingly light)
- Collard Green Oyster Rockefeller (paired with a french sparkler, collard greens cut through the richness of the oyster and pancetta)
- Eggs and Grits, Prosciutto,  Bacon Crumble (paired with a Riesling, the one questionable pairing, got a little lost in the dish)
- Crab Cake Fritter, Pickled Green Tomatoes (spicy Tabasco sauce made this dish, paired with Gerwurtzaminer  that was spot on)
- Tennessee Hot Chicken, Coleslaw, Brioche White Bread, Pickles, blue cheese dressing (paired with some Peach CObbler tasting moonshine cocktail that was brilliant) The cayenne-spiced chicken was some of the best fried chicken I've had
- Smothered Pork Chops, Okra Salad (paired with Pinot Noir), a definite nod to truck stop food, but way better!
- Pecan Pie, Bourbon Ice Cream (Paired with a Espresso beer aged in Bourbon barrels, great finish)

- The burgers are over-priced. If I'm paying $15-25 for a burger, it'd better be damn good.
- In light of how hyped up this place is, the food is seriously underwhelming. I think it's a little ridiculous that people sometimes wait over two hours for a table at this place. 
- Atmosphere: why is it so dark inside? Burgers and candles... a little incongruous, no? It's also really, really loud so it's not necessarily romantic either. I'm having a hard time gauging the ambience of this place.

If you're on the fence about this place, I would highly recommend checking out Shake Shack across the street instead.",2014-11-21 02:39:50,"{'food': ['burger', 'egg', 'fries'], 'drink': []}"

My girlfriend and I tried this place for the first time today. We went because it always seemed to have a line out the door. When we arrived, we sat down immediately and received menus from a hostess. No one else came to the table for at least another 20 minutes. Our server arrived (finally), and took our drink orders. She didn't return with our drinks (just two cups of coffee and a glass of water) for about ten minutes. She didn't ask if we were ready to order, which was really strange. We waited another ten minutes for her to come back and ask for our order, and she didn't even know the menu. Okay, she may be new, but having my menu taken away so she could read it herself was unpleasant and, frankly, rude. After she took our order, we waited and waited for what felt like forever. We watched other patrons enter and leave with full before we received our food. I even had to chase her down for coffee refills! She was lazy, inattentive, slow, and unpleasant.

The pub:
The area is sectioned into a bar area and a seating area. The bar was completely full when we came in and there were two decent sized groups in the seating area. The noise level was loud but we were able to still talk to each other if we leaned in and talked a bit louder. The lights are dimmed down but there are candles on the table that give a very warm atmosphere. The decor was very ""pub like"" and there were nice wooden benches to sit on for tables. 

The food:
+Bacon Grease Popcorn
We seen so many reviews recommending the popcorn so we had to try it. There's a reason for the hype. The popcorn was incredible. It had such an intense flavor from the bacon grease that it felt like if you ate the bag of popcorn, you would be satisfied with that as a meal. At the same time, I wasn't able to eat this popcorn like I would other popcorn or chips. My hand kept plunging in for more but at a certain point, I just couldn't anymore. It wasn't that I was full, it was that I think the flavor was almost too much for me to have it all in one go. This wasn't a big deal however. We took the popcorn home to eat and we managed to eat it over several days. The popcorn didn't show signs of becoming stale until the fourth day in and it was just left out, wrapped in a plastic bag. The popcorn comes in a brown paper bag with the top rolled down so that you get maybe 3/4 of a standard brown bag. When its brought out, dots of oil will already begin to show on the brown bag, almost as if it were a signature mark to an amazing snack. I would highly recommend getting this cheap and amazing appetizer and would definitely get this if I were to come back. 

+Roast Duck Sandwich
The roast duck was pretty good but I didn't eat much of it. It was my girlfriend's meal. It was a special that day and I think it was well worth it but I wouldn't get it again if we came back.

+Pulled Pork
I never had pulled pork before so I thought it was a bit dry. However, the sauces they provide you with go above and beyond to make this meal amazing. The three sauces are either vinegar based, mustard based, or ketchup based. My preference was the mustard then the ketchup and leagues behind is the vinegar for the simple fact that the vinegar was just a liquid and I like my sauces thicker. I realized I am not a huge fan of pulled pork however, and would not get this again.

The duck and pork came with sides:
+Cheddar Cheese Fries
The fries were pretty good but nothing special about them in my opinion. The cheddar cheese was nice but it wasn't too different from other cheese fries I've had. 

+Mashed Potatoes
These mashed potatoes were one of the best I've had. They aren't those pureed potatoes that you get from Boston Market or KFC. They were mashed enough so that they had a consistent... consistency but they were as liquidy as pureed mash. They had the skins on them still which I am a huge fan for and they were seasoned very well. The right amount. I would get these again.

+Baked Mac n Cheese
This was the best part of the meal, second to the popcorn. There wasn't anything too special about this mac n cheese and yet it was so delicious. The breading was just the right amount, maybe a bit less than I would have liked and the cheese was so very creamy. I would definitely come back for more. 

This was a nice place and I could definitely see people coming here with a bunch of their friends, getting some drinks and getting the amazing bacon grease popcorn to share. For a couples place, I think it was too loud but we definitely enjoyed it for a date.

They serve a prix fixe tasting menu that the chef selects for you.  The meal was creative and outstanding. They customize the tasting to your food preferences. My hubby and I were each served different dishes, as well as a unique wine pairing for each course. Be prepared to open the purse strings- the meal will set you back $400 for 2 ppl w/o drinks or $800 w/ a deluxe wine pairing and gratuity. The cost was $155/pp for food and the deluxe wine pairing was $135/pp (if I recall correctly, the standard wine pairing was $95/pp). If you enjoy wine, I highly recommend the pairing. The food was creative and delicious! Though I wasn't blown away by the dessert, it still gets 5 stars overall for food, service, atmosphere, etc.  I would definitely go back for a special occasion.

Little may be a bit of a stretch - the place is TINY.  Counter service for about 6ish, and about as many tables seating between 2 and 4 people.  The entire place has a bit of a ""too close to the kitchen"" smell and feel (a bit greasy) but it IS a greasy spoon so I guess it is to be expected.  

The food is exactly what you would expect - no need to list menu items, everything is totally adequate-to-good.  Were I a 23-year-old hungover college student this would be a four-or-five star rating, but as a fully-grown adult the charm of shabby-greasy-simple just doesn't do it for me.  My second trip did find me a bit over-served the night before, so I can vouch for the curative aspects of Mel's.  

The coffee is decent, if unremarkable.  That's pretty important for a breakfast spot - no complaints there, and the server kept it good and full - plus the pot is literally right there, so you don't even really need the server if your vice is caffeine.  

Service is the star here - everyone working was efficient, kind, friendly and seemed to really care if we enjoyed our meal.  For a greasy spoon prices were a bit high, considering this is NOT Main Street, but a fair value.  When full Mel's feels REALLY REALLY crowded, but if not full there isn't quite a claustrophobic nightmare.  Ceilings are low, tables are packed in, the stools suck.  EVERYTHING seems not quite square and level.  (OCD anyone?)

It was a dead night downtown due to the Phillies game being on, but we still had a 45 minute wait for a table.  Glad we waited.  We had a great little meal consisting of an excellent prohibition cocktail, an enormous chilled tequila that filled a martini glass, a fried shrimp appetizer, and a heavenly burger with heavenly cheese fries.  The drinks were excellent and reasonable considering the neoghborhood.  The app was good, not great, but after betting on whether we were going to get 3 or 4 shrimp for the $7 price, my date and I were stunned to count about 15 medium sized shrimp.  After that hit the spot, the village burger with thousand island dressing, bleu cheese and carmelized onions ($16) came out, as did the $7 duck fat cheese fries.  The portions were big, and all of it was melt in your mouth good.  The burger meat was of excellent quality and very well ground, something I look for in a burger.  The bun was perfect, toppings just right, and it was cooked perfectly.  The fries were dreamy, probably the best I've had.  All of that excellence was served in a small but upbeat, quirky fun setting.  The menu is limited, but I'm sure everything the they do is done with perfection in mind.

We had the jerk wings, ox tail, some sort of chicken, fried rice, and white rice... Maybe something else i don't recall

The explosive flavors, price to value ratio, great service (Tony is the man), BYOBness, and love that goes into making this fantastic food are tough to beat. The only downsides are that it is cash only, which I can get over, and far from where I live, which I am trying to persuade them to change.

For those who are unaware, Cambodia borders Thailand and Vietnam, and this is clearly reflected in the food as well. You get the refreshing lightness and acidity of Vietnamese cuisine as well as the curries and spiciness of Thai, all with a unique Cambodian flare. 

There is nothing here I haven't fully enjoyed. Prahok kahteeh (carmelized pork) is my favorite - on multiple occasions I have ordered takeout and trekked down here solely for this dish. The flavor of the pra-hok (fermented fish) marries perfectly with the sweetened pork, and the plate of veggies it's served on is like a work of art. Other highlights are mussels in curry (douse that sauce on your rice to find heaven), beef lok lak (with the citrusy dipping sauce!), and papaya salad (they make it real spicy if you ask). It is truly a family run business (the owner, mom, and aunt are the chefs), and everyone here is super friendly and ready to provide recommendations.

They do charge you for rice, probably because they know how addictive their sauces are, but maybe this is balanced by the fact that they serve bottled water free of charge (though why do you do this?

The decor is really cool and cozy with dark lighting and rug-lined walls. Everything was great at first, the staff was nice and our first waiter explained everything we needed to know about the 7-course meal. After that moment, everything went downhill. 

I think our second waiter was new so he got our first course mixed up with the hand washing part. He didn't seem to really care that he made a mistake and was very nonchalant about it as well.

After we washed our hands, the first three courses were served together with stale pita bread. There was one delicious eggplant dish and two underwhelming salads, one being what tasted like boiled carrots and a simple cucumber and tomato with vinegar dressing. 

After the waiter took that away, he brought us a pastry looking pie that was over dusted with powdered sugar. The filling tasted vaguely like bland rubbery egg whites and maybe tofu? I don't know, it was all very confusing. 

When this plate was taken away, we waited a whole hour and a half before the next dish came out. During this time no one came to ask us if we needed anything. We had no water, no help, and definitely no explanation as to why we had to wait so long for the next course. 

When someone finally asked us if we needed water, to which we responded yes, it never actually came. That happened twice within the two hours we were there.

Finally, the chicken dish came out and it looked like an over boiled baby chicken with a lemon slice on top. I feel like it probably doesn't take an hour to make this under seasoned chicken so I'm not sure what happened there but we had to wait another half hour (2 hours total now) before we decided we could no longer wait for the rest of the meal. So we asked for everything else to-go and to get the check. At this time, the waiter finally explained to us that the oven was broken but it was too late. 

Of course the check took another 30 minutes to come. By the time we left I couldn't tell if I was more mad about waiting 2.5 hours for nothing or about paying $160 (with gratuity already having been included in the bill for you) for five people to wait 2.5 hours.

With some others' reviews in mind, I eagerly took a bite with the expectation that this moment would completely redefine my life... only to recoil in surprised disgust as my taste buds came into contact with this greasy, hard-to swallow piece of dough. Apparently, it is possible for something to be both flavorless and salty at the same time. (This is it.) As some other reviewers point out, the dough is crunchy on the outside and under-cooked on the inside. Although it is very oily, the mixture of dry dough and ricotta gets easily stuck in my throat, unless I swallow it with half a bottle of beer. What bothers me the most, though, is that the pistachio bits keep falling off. On the bright side, the Rotolo is only $3.50. 

The Wood Oven salad was also very disappointing. It was a mixture of some kind of thinly sliced Italian ham with slightly pickled root vegetables, which were both charred and under-cooked at the same time. The only thing I liked was the $14 Margherita Pizza, which tasted just like it does at any other wood-fired pizza places. 

The service was good, even though we had to wait about 40 minutes to get seated.

We did not order anything fancy, just the typical dishes that you would typically see on the dinner table in any typical Italian family household, such as chicken parmesan, chicken alfredo, mussels over spaghetti with white sauce, spaghetti with sausages. All came fairly quickly and tasted great. 

We order connolly as dessert and it was the best connolly I ever had. Crust was crunchy but not hard, and the filling was creamy and rich with bits of dark chocolate that brought another layer of enjoyment. What I liked best about their connolly was that they were not overloaded with sugar like the ones I had at other places. 

Overall the dining experience was excellent. The place is kind of small though, to my surprise. Their tables are fairly small and the gap between tables is fairly narrow. I wondered if that was just how the restaurant was set up originally when they opened in 1900 and just never changed anything since then. I suppose it's not a concern for their servers because their servers are all very slender. When we were leaving at the end of the meal, I saw a family walking into the restaurant with a baby in a baby carrier. Too bad I didn't get to see how the restaurant managed to find a space for the baby carrier.

They don't take reservations and I wouldn't recommend dining here for a large party.  I would stick to a party of 4 or less.  The service can be slow a lot of times, but the server is super helpful and the FOOD IS WORTH THE WAIT!  I recommend calling ahead before making the trip to S.Philly because sometimes, they may close for Cambodian holidays or for a catering job.  It's the worst to be excited for a meal to find out that the restaurant is closed that day!

MUST TRY STARTERS:  
GRILLED SEASONED MEATBALL STICKS:  These are AMAZING!!  Unfortunately, they don't always have it because 1) there was high demand for it that day and they ran out or 2) it's the winter time and they can't grill these bad boys in the cold!  I usually call ahead to see if they have any that day or can put some aside for my visit!

PRAH-HOK KAHTEEH:  This is a caramelized ground pork with various spices.  It is served with seasonal vegetables that you use to dip in the minced pork.  The smell may be tough for diners who are new to Southeast Asian cuisine, but it's a tasty must-try!

MUST TRY FAMILY-STYLE DISHES:
SOUPS:  I really enjoy ALL of their soups/stews.  But my friends and boyfriend's favorite is the SAH-LAW MACHEU KAHTEEH with the PORK RIB TIP.  It is a slow-simmered sour soup prepared with coconut milk base, fresh pineapple, and fresh basil.  The coconut and lemon grass makes it very tasty and aromatic.  It has A LOT of pineapples and we wish they had less pineapples and maybe add potatoes or carrots to balance out the sweet pineapples and to absorb the tasty broth.  It is served with pork ribs and tips.  It would be even tastier if there were more pork ribs because the meat on the bones are much more tender!

CHA MUSSLES OR TALAPIA FILETS:  This dish is prepared and cooked in a special blend green curry mix and spice tossed with fresh basil.  WE LOVE THE CURRY and always ask for extra sauce, please!  Most diners order the mussels, but I prefer to order this dish with the fileted tilapia.  It really depends if I'm already ordering another fish dish or not.  If I order another fish dish, then I order this with the mussels.  If not, then I order this with the tilapia.

WHOLE TALAPIA with Tamarind Sauce:  Some may be afraid of eating whole fish with the head and bones in tack.  But com'on, the rest of the world eats their fish this way - it's so much tastier.  I love the tamarind sauce that they give on the side - I pour it all over the fish.


SO-SO DISHES:
GRILLED BEEF STICK or GRILLED CURRY CHICKEN STICK:  These are ok - they can be dry and lack taste.  The Cambodian street vendors' sticks are tastier and more tender.  I would recommend the meatball sticks instead if you can eat pork.

BOK LA-HONG:  It is a spicy papaya salad with fresh tomatoes.  I don't always order this because of the other great dishes, but sometimes I will if I feel like I ordered too much protein and need some more veggies in my meal.

SKIP THIS DISH:
PLEAH SACH-KHOE: The menu says that it is ""thinly sliced choice beef marinated in lime juice, lemongrass, khmer kitchen sauce and spices top with fresh herbs.""  The description sounds good and we've mistakenly ordered it a couple of times, forgetting that we didn't like this dish before.  I would suggest SKIPPING this dish.  The beef doesn't have much flavor and is not the best quality.  And the beef is not marinated - the sauce is served on the side.  Khmer Kitchen has so many other great dishes.  Skip this one.

I admit to being a bit of an atmosphere snob most of the time, and this place wasn't on my radar - I actually never heard of it until they texted me the name and address that night.

This place is big.  It has a downstairs restaurant area and then a bar upstairs.  It was a Saturday night and they had a live blues band playing, which was actually good.  Nonetheless I was there to talk talk talk with friends of mine who I haven't seen in ages, so I got out of the room where the band was playing as quickly as possible and moved into the lounge upstairs so I could speak to my friends without shouting in their ears.   

The lounge is cool looking - it feels like you are at the house of a stylish friend with the comfy couches, chairs, fireplace and TV.  I liked the look of it.  

I was sticking to wine that night and it did seem pricey at $11 per glass.  I don't mind paying fancy wine prices at fancy places, but in my opinion, the prices shouldn't get into the double digits at a casual establishment such as this.  

The staff seemed clueless to me.  We asked one of the bouncers if we could move one of the chairs and he just stared at us blankly and didn't answer.  We took this as a yes, and moved the chair.  I don't think they hire Mensa members there. 

At the end of the night I decided to order a snack.  After looking at the menu I ordered some fries.  EIGHT DOLLAR FRENCH FRIES.  I questioned the bar tender to see if this price was correct.  He went on and on about how they used fresh potatoes and 3 delicious sauces, etc.  They arrived and were....okay.  Not even really okay, just really subpar.  And the sauces...one of these ""special sauces"" was vinegar.  Haha - special.  I have had better fries everywhere - just off the top of my head, the Abbaye, North 3rd, Sidecar, Resurection Ale House, etc.  The fries got a 3/10 on taste and the $8 price tag seemed extremely unwarranted.",2012-02-13 21:26:22,"{'food': ['fries'], 'drink': []}"

Total for 4 people was $56 with TONS of leftovers. Next time we should probably only order 3 dishes-- but they were all so yummy. 

Based on the reviews- we got there on Friday at 5:30pm to avoid the crowds and we were the second table seated. Whew. 

Dishes came out in the following order: 

1. Sah-law ka koe- simmered chicken with veggies -- delish! It's like a curry but much lighter with lemongrass flavors and veggies like papaya and eggplant. A definitely must.

2. Cha Krung- spicy beef with celery and lemongrass. The spicy-ness of this dish was perfect and had a light coating of grated lemongrass and peppers. Also a must order. 

3. Nyum sahdau-  traditional salad with tons of different ingredients and fish sauce. Server (who is the son of the cooks) told us to eat the salad slowly to enjoy the various profiles and that each bite tastes different. It definitely did! Unfortunately by the time this dish came out we were starting to get full and so we packed this away to save room for the last dish. 

4. Threh chin- tilapia filet with a coconut / peanuty sauce. Also delicious and loved the creaminess of the sauce. 

So many things to like about this place-- the mom and pop nature (various generations were cooking our food in the back), the BYOB with no corkage fee (and they'll keep your white wine cold for you in their fridge), and the amazing dishes. Wish we had a Cambodian place in DC-- the most similar at this point would be Thip Khao for Laotian food in Columbia Heights.

During my most recent attempt to give this place a chance this past Sunday, my brunch companion ordered the vegetable omelet but requested that the chanterelles be omitted. Our waiter didn't skip a beat before responding in a disrespectful and patronizing tone (direct quote): ""Have you had chanterelles before? Chanterelles are the finest mushrooms in the world. I recommend that you don't omit them. You should order them on the side."" My companion, who is actually a very successful chef, good-naturedly told the waiter that it was fine if the kitchen wanted to put the mushrooms on the side (I think she pitied him for his abject cluelessness and wondered if I might want the shrooms.) The waiter was generally surly and had no idea how to relate to customers; we could observe this in his attitude toward nearby tables too. I wondered if he was a member of the owner's family; otherwise it's hard to fathom what he's doing on the front lines. His behavior was enough to seal Kanella's fate for me, but the fact that the $10 french press coffee was the worst I have *ever* had in any context, and that the food was for a third time just a notch above mediocre, didn't help either.

The sushi has to be graded on a curve. For the neighborhood, it's 5-star. But if this business were in Center City, it would be a 2-star last resort. What I hate about this observation is that sushi, if taken seriously, can be truly mind-blowing when made well. 

But these kids -- yes, it's run by kids -- don't take it seriously. In fact, they don't seem to take any part of the business seriously.

I had a chance to go last night for the first time. I was lucky - I know an insider. So, we didn't have to wait TOO long for a table. But I heard they don't normally take reservations and the wait is sometimes a bit long. We also had a chance to try a pretty good variety of dishes.

Drinks: I don't drink whiskey, but my boyfriend and his friend both loved a tasting of 3 and after-dinner one, too. I had two different cocktails: Ginger Rogers (and I'm not even a huge gin fan) and a De Rigueur. Both lovely and tasty! Yes, girly.

Apps: I don't do oysters, but the other couple with us enjoyed 2 of each. I had the pickled truffle lemon artichokes, and I was in heaven. Whipped ricotta to spread on your toast? Great idea! This is the best artichoke concoction I've ever tasted. Best. The pickled Herb Cherry Tomatoes were yummy, too, though I've had a lot of great cherry tomatoes lately. Popcorn shrimp were tasty, but the sauce was what really impressed me. As did the mustard and cheese sauce for the soft pretzels. The condiments topped the pretzels, for me. That cheese!

Dinner: Burger - medium, cheddar, bacon, awesome. 2 can split it. The bbq Pork looked wonderful, too, and when I looked at my friends' plates, they were clean. It was gone in, like, 1 1/2 minutes.

Dessert: We got to try all three desserts. The Irish Car Bomb was good, kind of like a wet cake, though. The Shortcake was good, with a mix of strawberry/rhubarb, though you couldn't taste much rhubarb in it. On the side of that was a buttermilk sorbet which really impressed me. The winner of best dessert, though, is the 'Nutter Shake. I've never had such a milkshake - so many flavors, thick, and with a bite-sized blondie on the side. Blondies melt me.

I would give it 5 stars, if it weren't so pricey.

Is it the blasting music and the hipster wait staff?  Is it the fact that this place is always busy and it must be good if so many people think it is and are willing to wait for a tight seat in an overcrowded restaurant?

I don't really understand why this is considered one of the best breakfast places in Philadelphia. 

The best thing about this restaurant was the fast service and I am certain the wait staff make bank here (more power to them).  I would rate the service a five and the food a zero since it was hardly edible. 

The Vegetarian Chicken Fried Steak was greasy, salty and dry.  I got a small taste of the macaroni and cheese since most of it was burnt and stuck in the ramekin it was served in and the buttermilk biscuit tasted like saw dust.  The salad was the best part of the meal. 

I expect that a vegetarian dish is never going to be as good as the real thing.  But it's pretty tough to mess up mac and cheese. 

The other issue was the music was so loud that I could barely hear my friend across the table.  Although I am a huge rap music fan and I love to blast it while in the car or at home, I would prefer not to hear Biggie Smalls rapping about coke deals instead of trying to have a conversation.

The duck sandwich was ridiculous. I could have kept ordering over and over until they rolled me out.

My wife and I decided to check this place out because we heard they had a decent salad bar. Well, we didn't know the salad bar charged by the pound--what is this, Whole Foods? The annoying order-taker rolled his eyes and spoke in mumbly broken English, like he was so inconvenienced that he had to take nine seconds to explain this to us.

The salad bar itself was decent. The selection was a bit broader than you would expect from a hole in the wall pizza place and most of the foods was relatively high quality. The greens, however, which are the most important part of a freaking salad, were wilted garbage. This factors pretty heavily into the low rating (coupled with the awful service). 

We also got a shrimp appetizer. It was pretty good--decent portion and alright quality. Not amazing, but not bad by any means. 

Back to the terrible service: We had our one-year-old with us and they didn't even offer a high chair. We had to take turns holding our son as we ate. Considering the fact that no one else was in the entire restaurant, they could have at least offered some assistance in this area.

It sounds like this a place for college kids to show up for late night pizza and wings. That's cool, I guess, but don't expect to get acceptable service and don't expect much from the salad bar.",2012-04-15 23:48:11,"{'food': ['salad', 'shrimp appetizer'], 'drink': []}"

And to boot, she's a far better waitress than 90% of the other restaurants I've been to. It was amusing how serious she was at ringing up my bill. But on to the food.

I have to say it's nice to have something other than banal Middle-Eastern food prepared with little to no imagination. SKH puts thought into their menu, though by  no means was my experience a cerebral one. I ordered a lamb stew that was cooked in a sauce similar to a curry, though a bit sweeter and it had onions and pepper. It was served with a light salad with a yogurt dressing as a starter. Then came the brown rice and lamb dish with Afghan bread. The lamb was like butter in your mouth and the sauce was fantastic. All the food complemented itself. And they also brew a wonderful tea. My only negative detail was that I found the sauce to be a tad bit salty. As for one who likes to keep an eye on the salt consumption, this was a minor detail.

My friend lives in the neighborhood, so I've been here more times than I can count. Another friend called it ""The Sipowitz Bar"" and I'm still not sure why. The food is solid and the drinks are strong and reasonably priced. The last time I was here a severely drunk guy with his relatively normal friends at the table behind us. On the way out, drunk guy walked up and said ""If I weren't so drunk, I'd ask you out."" And I said ""If you weren't so drunk we might take you seriously"".

Ok, but here's the real story. When I was living on the east coast (and wild), one of my friends lived in SF and the rest of us would celebrate her birthday without her. One year her birthday coincided with a friend's husband's birthday, for which she had rented out the upstairs room of the London. Since it was such a fancy occasion, we made a 15 inch cutout of our friend in SF (we'll call her Cutout J) and took her out for the night.  Cutout J was a huge hit as she posed for pictures down other people's pants and shirts, pictures of people licking her, pictures of her hanging out with the monkeys painted on the wall of the upstairs bathrooms (I have the photos, I know I wasn't imagining them). The waiters working the party were in love with Cutout J and asked to keep her. I said sure, as long as they didn't throw her away. Her parents went into the bar a couple of months later and noticed a 15 inch cutout of their daughter hanging out with the bottles behind the bar. That, my friends, was a high point in my career of fucking with my friends. Well, that and the time that Cutout J's parents threw a party at the London and I convinced Cutout J that another friend of ours had just gotten engaged at the Hard Rock Cafe in Philly after her boyfriend hired a mime to mime out ""will you marry me?""

My first experience with the ""handy nasty"" was when I used to be vegetarian. I had been concerned that I wouldn't be able to sample everything since there were so many meat options. My server went out of her way to check with the kitchen that the dishes I ordered would be vegetarian-friendly and accommodated my other requests. The many other times I have been here since, the wait staff has always been friendly and helpful. They do a great job of refilling your rice, expediting your food, and are always ensuring that you're enjoying yourself.

As for the food, the flavors are always robust and are some of the most authentic in West Philly. I recommend the Dan Dan Noodles and the Eggplant with Garlic Sauce. They are both more mild, but are flavorful and classics worth getting every time. All the entree dishes also offer many chances to be adventurous in your flavor combination or spice level with all the different styles. The food can get a bit oily, though. Spicy dishes (most likely due to added chili oil), and dishes that have larger amounts of sauce tend to accumulate grease, most noticeable in take-out orders or leftovers.

Next up, I had their ""Thanksgiving Dinner"". You know how no one makes Thanksgiving dinner better then mom? Yeah, the cooks at Jones took my mom to screw off, and showed her how its done.
The turkey was super moist, covered in gravy. The potatoes, just the right amount of garlic. The stuffing....oh man...the stuffing was so damn good. I want to talk about the cranberry sauce, but it might get the review flagged for me thinking dirty things ago a food portion. Lets just say ""Yum"".

My boyfriend and I are something of pizza connoisseurs, having sampled slices from basically every neighborhood from South, Central, North, and Northeast Philadelphia.  Whenever we get hungry, it just seems like the easiest option.  When Lu started building a studio facility in Brewerytown, naturally our first inclination was to find a pizza place and grab some slices after we were done working.  When a friend from the neighborhood suggested Lazo's, we knew we had to make the extra schlep just to try this bounty.  

Now, I've never been one to judge a place by it's decor, so let's just start off by saying this is no hipster joint with chalkboards all around and wood furnishing and all that bull.  It's an old-style linoleum-floored fake-granite-veneered greasy spoon.  So I wasn't expecting to be blown out the water when I sunk my teeth into the first bite.  Here's the run-down:

SLICES:  moderately sized.  Not extraordinarily big, but very satisfying.  The key here is that you can get toppings a la carte, which makes a perfect double-cooked slice of pizza where the cheese is chewy, the toppings are fresh, and the sauce is hot. 

SAUCE.  Oh my god.  The sauce is seriously the best I've ever had.  It's slightly sweet with a big savory undertone and seasoned perfectly.  I could seriously eat a bowl of this sauce.  I think I might next time I go there.

SERVICE:  These guys are so nice.  Once you go in once, they remember your face, name, and what you do for a living. Lazo is an amazing guy, and the people he hires are just as nice.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  Cheese slice, Greek slice, pizza fries.

They don't deliver very far, but it's the kind of place I will make the extra effort to get to just so that I can eat that magnificent pizza.  Good lord.  Go try it!",2013-07-23 13:39:18,"{'food': ['pizza', 'pizza fries'], 'drink': []}"

The bell peppers were cooked well but I'm not a big fan of bell peppers and though the description says ""sausage, onions, peppers, and home-made mustard"", I was expecting spicy peppers, not bell peppers (especially since other items specifically list ""roasted red peppers"". Not a big deal, but I think the sauce/juices from them ended up making the hoagie a bit soggy, and it became really chewy, even despite the mustard on the bottom. 

I'd probably go here again, but likely wouldn't get the po boy, and would ask for clarification about the toppings.",2017-08-23 04:40:42,"{'food': ['mac and cheese balls', 'alligator po boy'], 'drink': []}"

We ordered two half-orders: Za'atar and Buttermilk Ranch. Both were delicious and heavy on the rub and flavoring. The meat was juicy, and I think they achieved what they intended. 

As mentioned in other reviews, though, this is Korean-style chicken, and I have to admit I prefer the traditional approach with the buttermilk flavor. The pickles weren't up my alley so much, which is not to say that they weren't good for those who like the sweet and strongly flavored. Though the plain honey donut was as good as you could hope.

For the flavored donuts, we tried the strawberry-rhubarb, pomegranate-Nutella, Appollonia, and Indian cinnamon (I think! They disappeared rather quickly.). All were good, though my favorite was the Appollonia--the perfect mix of sugar and spice (cocoa, spices, orange?). They were consistently moist and fresh, with a perfect cake-like texture and donut-level chewiness. Definitely wished that this place was closer for the morning donut pick-me-up!

PASS ON...i wasn't too thrilled over latkes (was a bit too fried up for me...) and the biscuit was D R Y!! pretty much crumble all over the place as you try to dip into the sauces... 
 
SERVICE: like others have mentioned... our waiter was very quick and accommodating...

Inebriation was the tipping point and I booked an uber for myself and my companion to this place on a Friday evening after happy hour. 

Big bonus that this place has alcohol. I ordered a beer to top off my previous imbibing and obviously nachos. My companion ordered steak tacos. The tacos came first, my companion's verbal candid review was that it was subpar to what he's used to in SoCal. The bar is high in this case.

Either real life time passage or my significant impatience made the wait seem like a hot minute. I passed the time by pouring the three hot sauces they have into those little cups to prepare myself. I drunkenly got the same hot sauce twice. No harm, no foul. 

Chips are crispy and loaded with sour cream, tomatoes, pickled-jalapeno slices, and radish shavings. The amount of beans were scarce. There was also this delicious powdery white cheese I've become accustomed to consuming with my mexican food recently.

The first time I dined, was for my birthday and I informed the staff I was gluten free and couldn't eat onions. They seemed accommodating off the bat but I later learned in my meal, my dish had scallions and breadcrumbs nestled deep inside of it. The waiter was the least bit apologetic and I suffered for the next 2 days. 

More recently, I came here for brunch and was so excited to finally try their gorgeous looking menu. After 22 minutes of waiting for water, the waiter seemed to not really know anything about the menu or when I told him about my restrictions. We started with the Greek plate which was unreal but when we moved to entrees, my meal had onions inside the eggs and was inedible. Again, pissed.

Nonetheless, we both were excited to enjoy some Thai food in a Thai restaurant.
I made reservations via phone on Friday, and spoke to a very polite person on the phone who was able to take me reservation with no isse, and was delighted to hear they were a BYOB (I have a bit of a wine cellar with a selection of somewhat unique wines) and did not charge an outrageous corking fee. 
The place itself was well put together; very clean, simply decorated without being boring, and quite spacious (long, but narrow). The service was quick and friendly as well. They made sure that there was always a full glass and no empty plates in front of you for very long at all, without making one feel rushed, a rarity indeed. 
The food was, I regret to say, a tad bland. We started with a chicken Satay that gave me high hopes - flavorful, moist poultry with a peanut sauce that wasn't overpowering. Following this for our main courses we ordered Drunken Noodles with a Massaman Curry, to share amongst ourselves. Both seemed, at least in my opinion, a bit lackluster. The noodles were overdone, and there was just a lack of punch that makes me enjoy that dish so very much. The curry was also bland; there was no discernable flavor that really jumped out for me. The portions were quite large, however. 
For dessert we had a mango sticky rice which was overly sweet (for me) but was still well done and beautifully presented with a fresh mango (yum!) flower atop the rice.
I give this place 3 stars because of that blandness. I would really hope to come back here sometime soon and bump up the rating, because the rest of the dining experience was quite fantastic.",2013-04-29 14:04:33,"{'food': ['Chicken Satay', 'Mango Sticky Rice'], 'drink': []}"

The mosaic tile art makes you feel like you have escaped to an enchanted little paradise. But let's not forget the inside which is equally whimsical with it's New York City eclectic vibe. 

The good stuff....we ordered a large half white and half red pizza. Their pizza is Sicilian style and it was most delicious. The dough was thin, crispy and buttery. Perfect cheese to sauce ratio and the sauce was just lovely. The pizza was so good we ate the whole large pie!!! (Extra gym time for me but well worth it). After our pizza we ordered dessert. I had a vanilla bean cheesecake which was utter simplistic perfection and my husband had the Napoleon waffle which was basically a waffle ice cream sandwich. With being outside and eating his waffle sandwich he said he felt like he was down the shore and that's always a lovely feeling.

Waitress took 10 minutes to get to my table for the first time, another 8 minutes to bring my first diet coke, etc.  I did not get better from there.

I ordered the french onion soup and that was good at a good price.  I ordered the turkey dinner.

It's a cute restaurant and we enjoyed eating outside. The server was nice and even offered to wrap our leftovers which is a rarity these days.

I had the bacon Mac n cheese, the cinnamon roll pancakes and the cheesesteak. The Mac n cheese was decent, no complaints and nothing great to say. It was probably the best thing we had. The pancake was good, again nothing fantastic to say it was a pancake with minimal fruit and toppings. I'm not sure what was going on with the cheesesteak. They had a vegan option which I did not take and yet it seemed like I was eating vegan imitation meat. It looked and tasted strange and they had too many southwestern flavors in it for my taste. I ate a quarter of it and sent the rest home with my boyfriend who liked it more than I did. 

The bloody Mary's I was at least expecting to be good but yet again tasted very watered down. They have an option to add bacon for an additional dollar, don't do it you barely get a sliver of bacon.

My boyfriend and I gave Naoki a try instead of Terakawa. We sat down and one of the staff (not sure he was a manager or owner) asked if we wanted hot green tea or ice water.

We ordered miso ramen and shoyu with chicken katsu. Chicken katsu(which was good) came in first. So we started eating them and ended up finishing it before shoyu ramen came.

I had the NY Strip.  I requested it medium-rare and got what I asked for.  In addition, all of their steaks come with a side and a choice of sauces and meat preparation flavoring.  These are luxuries that are unheard of at some 'finer' steak restaurants.  My date had the fillet mignon medium-well and found that it was slightly overcooked.

I also had the soup special for the night (sweet potato soup with leaks) and it was delicious.  At $9 it was a bit pricey, but it was a special evening out so I didn't mind.

Since our server was so delightful and attentive, we actually looked at the dessert menu and ordered the Molten Chocolate Cake.  It was a delicious chocolate cake with a hot liquid chocolate center and a scoop of vanilla ice cream in top to cool down eat bite.  Be aware (not beware) that this takes 10 minutes to prepare, so order it in advance if you know that you want it.

They accommodated our large party (9 people) even though we were 15 minutes late for our reservation, which was nice of them. 

I had Huevos Rancheros, which comes in a personal-size cast iron skillet and is filled with everything you could ever want: beans, cheese, tortillas, salsa, and two perfectly sunny-side up eggs on top. It's not an easy to eat dish, but it works very well to eat with the all-you-can-eat chips ($1/person.) 

I'm not sure if I missed this the last time I was there, or if it's a new promotion, but each brunch entree comes with a free mimosa or bloody mary. My bloody mary was tasty, spicy, and flavorful - I was mixing some fun additions like celery or olives, but it wasn't disappointing.

A few people at the table got the chicken and biscuits with gravy, which I tried, and I can't wait to return to order my own portion. 

The service was good, not great - but nothing that negatively affected our meal. 

In the end, I feel like we did extremely well - each paying $10-$15 for our final bill (including alcohol, tax, and gratuity.) Not bad for brunch + booze!",2012-11-19 19:35:55,"{'food': ['Huevos Rancheros', 'Chicken and Biscuits with Gravy'], 'drink': ['Mimosa', 'Bloody Mary']}"

In the summer I visited Tria almost every Sunday for Sunday School. I always order all three of the specials to try anything I haven't had before. I'm not really big on cheese, but I've yet to come across cheese at Tria that I didn't enjoy. A happy hour was recently introduced on Monday through Thursday. Great deals on top notch beer is always a nice treat on my way home from work. Everything is extremely clean and professional, this is a nice atmosphere for a romantic first date. The music isn't loud enough to make conversations a shouting match and the lighting is perfect to the 'T'. I have been to establishments that play music too loudly and make conversations awkward because no one can hear each other.

I signed up for a membership card on my second visit because I knew I'd become a regular. Tria has become my favorite place to have a relaxing Sunday night and wind down an eventful weekend.",2010-02-05 01:33:18,"{'food': ['cheese'], 'drink': ['wine', 'beer']}"

Great rotating beer selection for my husband, an amazing wine (and sometimes cocktail) list for me, and stellar food. We don't get here nearly as much as we'd like just because it's a destination-type of place for us, which is a shame!

Staff and service is amazing. During our last visit the manager asked how our food was, and I told him, in a totally truthful manner, that I preferred the way they had prepared a certain menu item before they changed their menu, and he insisted upon taking it off the bill. This was totally unnecessary -- I wasn't even complaining, I was just being honest hoping they would bring back the old menu item -- but still the gesture was still appreciated.
