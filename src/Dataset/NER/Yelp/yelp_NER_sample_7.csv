We stopped in around lunch time, it was not busy so we were able to sit at the pizza bar and watch them cook. Now just to forwarn anyone we are not big fans of Neapolitan pizza just because it's hard to find a place that really knows how to cook it. It's always very burned and very soft amd wet in the middle. The staff was great, very friendly and the menu had great meat and veggie options. 

Today we started with their meatball and rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta and pistachio pesto) appetizer. The meatballs were very tender, had great flavor and the sauce had great flavor. The rotolo was a nice treat it had a crispy exterior, soft interior filled with tasty mortadella and creamy ricotta and the pistachio pesto was a nice compliment. Next we tried their shaved cauliflower salad. The greens were fresh it just a bit to tart of a dressing maybe to much vinegar. Next we tried their Tonno Pizza (Sicilian tuna, onion, mozzarella and parmigiano). The toppings were very tasty, the dough had great chew and texture and the sauce was sweet and tangy. Next we tried their Pastinaca Pizza (roasted parsnip, charred brussel sprouts, brown butter parsnip sauce, mozz, parm and lemon zest. The flavor combination was outstanding very different but a great veggie option. While the dough had great flavor and texture it was very burned and very soggy in the middle.

It's worth trying if you're like me and didn't grow up around here eating monkey bread and 'wuder' ice 'down the shaw'.

We were out last week checking out our hood since the weather has finally opened up a bit. It was a Friday night at around 11 and Passyunk was pretty busy. Not much was open but this quaint little tea shop slash old school ice cream parlor. They had tables out on the sidewalk and everyone had a plate with half-eaten dessert of some sort left on it. We decided to stop and have a bite. 

Along with the Italian cream, we ordered the Passyunk S'more and man, it was outrageous. And aptly named! They piled up this super rich chocolate and graham crackers in what seemed like 6-7 layers. Top that off with a mound of marshmallows that they fire right at your table with a blowtorch. You basically extinguish the flames when the mallows are charred to your liking.

Not only did everything they had look tasty (we wanted everything), but I couldn't help but notice a sign that says ""$1.00 coffee - any size"". Sure enough, I was there at 7 the next morning for that. How can you go wrong with gourmet coffee that doesn't taste like it's been burning for hours for $1.00. That kind of thing just doesn't happen these days. I've since been there at least once a day - and sometimes twice. They've always got a great selection and it's always fresh.

I ordered the calamari to start and a burger with a mixed green side salad dressed with sherry vinaigrette.

The calamari was lightly battered had a decent crisp to it.  The accompanying jalapeño (also battered and fried) lent a great, subtle overall spice but was in itself so moist that the batter would slush off.  The lemon was fresh and juicy.  The tarter sauce wasn't very balanced.  A bit too tart, overall.

The burger was recommended as the star of the show.  I thought it was slightly below average.  I can see they were trying to do a charbroiled patty but it was bland and almost too burnt.  There were no accompanying sauces and even though I ordered the cook to be medium, it was much too dry (even for a medium).  It came with  enjoyable bread and butter pickle slices and fresh tasting lettuce as well as tomato.

Three members of my party ordered the Philly cheese steak, which I didn't try.  It was described by all three as ""bland mush.""  

The fries were very well seasoned, extremely crispy, with an almost velvety interior.  Definitely top twenty fries of all time.

I couldn't wait to try the Village Burger being that I've heard it's one of the best in Philly.

When my friend and I got there around 7:30pm we were told that there would be at least a 30 minute wait to eat inside but that we could eat at the full-service bar or outside. It was a Monday, and either way it didn't bother us as the evening was nice and I always enjoy a good outdoor meal.

Once seated we both couldn't get over how uncomfortable our waitress seemed. It might've been the case that she was new and getting the hang of things on what was supposed to be a slow Monday night, but regardless it was all too noticeable how awkward she seemed when taking our order and performing other tasks like cleaning our plates/refilling drinks. I ordered whiskey and my friend got beer, and she asked us what we wanted to drink next when we were both clearly barely halfway through our drinks. She also felt the need to pour us water in our glasses when they were definitely still 3/4 or more of the way filled. I just didn't see all that as necessary and it detracted from the experience.

The burger itself was delicious I will say, but overpriced. I'm not in any rush to come back here for a burger to be sure. Each topping outside of lettuce is at least $2 extra or more. So the price of a medium-sized burger easily balloons to about $18...and that doesn't even include the $5 Duck Fat fries that any diner would typically want as well.

(Tip: If you want to try this dish, make sure to call ahead and check to see their availability for lamb). 

I must say, Greek coffee really hits the spot. It has a very rich, chocolatey taste to it. And the amount served is perfect for ending your meal. 

I assume the restaurant is family owned and operated, including the waiters. We had the same waiter the two times we went and he was VERY accommodating to where we wanted to sit, given the restaurant isn't that spacious. Here's one of the things I really appreciated: The restaurant is always busy, and there can be long waits for when you come without reservation. However, while you are dining waiters do not rush you to get out or to leave once you've signed the check.

A few days ago I received notice that a new pizza spot opened on the corner of 11th and Jackson in a space in dire need of a revival. There have been restaurants in this space coming and going for years and I believe (and hope) that Nannie Franco's will fill the necessary void for another amazing neighborhood pizza place. 

After spending a couple hours doing the normal Friday night South Philly arm curls I reached home with an outstanding urge for some food ill probably regret in the morning. With limited options I dacked my brain. Insomnia cookies? Paulies? Some random Chinese place with a name I can't pronounce?? Just before throwing in the towel and possibly going to sleep without have my liver and stomach simultaneously screaming at me when I wake up. But with a drunken flicker of the light bulb I remember the pizza place on 11th and Jackson is open until 4. Having exhausted my late night options to the point if absolute boredom I decided to try some new blood. 

I called and got more pizza that me and my friends could eat. 2 pizzas with sausage and cheese was 26 bones. The lady behind the phone also informed me that we get a free Stromboli with our order, score! Since I just watched Babe randomly a few nights ago I have been craving pig. I went with the sausage Stromboli and they even added bacon! 

I can't remember the exact time the pizza arrived. I would say it was less than 3 episodes of Family Guy. 

The driver was friendly enough and the pizza came hot. The crust was crispy and the cheese stuck just long enough for my mouth flap to engulf the entirety of a slice. 

My friends barley came up for air between the free Stromboli and the pizza. I throughly enjoyed the red sauce and how crispy the chunks of sausage were. The pizza and Stromboli contained enough pig to satisfy my craving for Babe, if only until breakfast. 

I tried the left overs in the morning and they were just as good as the night before. And the cheese did the impossible for typical morning after pizza, it stayed on!

First off, let me mention that my fiancee and I got here on a Saturday around 7:00, and while we expected there might be a wait, we had no idea it would be and hour and a half wait! Strangely, though, seating outside was available right away, so we were more than happy to take it!

As with most people, I had heard about this place from a friend and had been wanting to try it for a while. My fiancee, being a vegetarian, has been on a kick to try as many different veggie burgers around the city as she can. 

I really wanted to order a glass of whiskey here, but decided to go for a beer instead figuring it would go better with a burger than a glass of whiskey (which I prefer without any food). So, I ordered the IPA they had on tap, which I should mention was one of the best I've tasted. For dinner, my fiancee ordered the veggie burger (no surprise there) with sautéed onions and fried egg (she's a vegetarian that eats eggs...) along with vegetarian fries, and I ordered the village burger (medium) with sautéed onions and the cheddar cheese along with the duck fat fries.

The burger was hands down THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER TRIED. The meat was cooked perfectly, had the right amount of seasoning and flavor, and the toppings (including their house thousand island dressing) all went together perfectly. And somehow, even though it was a standard sized 8 oz burger, the thing felt like it was 16 oz, nonetheless I ate the entire thing! As if this was not enough, the duck fat fries were incredible; and yes, I ate all of them as well...

I would be amiss if I did not also mention on here that the veggie burger my fiancee got was also very good, according to her it was the best she has tried as well.

I asked the hostess if that was true and she said yes.  They had several specials with crab in them, and I had a groupon so I was willing to splurge on the fancy sushi.  We ordered and then sat down to wait.  Probably 25 minutes go by and the waitress comes over to tell Katrina they are out of crab, and she has to pick a different roll.  Now, they didn't say anything to me, so we figured I must have gotten the last of it.  Well, about 10 minutes later the waitress came to let me know that two of the rolls I ordered were no longer available.  I replaced one with something different, and requested that the other just have the crab changed to something else.  About 15 minutes after that, we finally got our food.  It took about 45 minutes for this process to go down, which caused us to be really late for the party, so we actually requested to just sit at a table and eat our food instead of taking it with us.

First of all, it has exploded with popularity. Dinner service, even at 5pm, is extremely popular. It has become a trendy place to see and be seen in the uber-chic neighborhood of Northern Liberties. 

The second observation is directly tied to the first- the outstanding food. No wonder El Camino has drawn rave reviews and grown exponentially since my first taste; the food is magnificent. Without a touch of pretense, the menu reflects both Tex Mex and authentic Mexican cuisine. It is extensive and has options for both the picky and adventurous, the carnivore and vegetarian, the glutton and the lush. 

May I point out that the Fried Pickle Chips are heaven-sent? I sometimes catch myself daydreaming about them at nite. The crisp vinegary crunch of the pickles, the savory, molten hot breading, and of course, the spicy, smooth, simply decadent chipolte mayo dip served on the side makes my mouth water. The flavors explode in your mouth in a WOOSH of satisfaction. The Fried Pickle Chips at El Camino Real are my favorite appetizer in Philadelphia. 

I won't wax poetic about the rest of the menu, but just know that it is nearly equal to the said satisfaction of the Pickle Chips. Just to name a few, I love the Texas cheesesteak, the pork bellies, the chili and the enchiladas.  

Furthermore, El Camino distinguishes itself in decor as well. It isn't overly oozing faux authenticity the way that the Cantina begs to (for real, you use flour tortillas, so let's not pretend this is actually South of the Border, ok??) and yet still satisfies the exotic taste inherent to Tex-Mex. The servers are great, it is not overly loud, and oh yeah, the brunch is amazing too.

I was looking forward to it most, but it turned out to be dry and bland. There were little cheese balls and olives and I don't even know what else. I can't remember because it was so forgettable. 

Second, I got the verde salad and it was eh. It didn't have enough avocado and it was also way too bitter. I was so excited for the pasta I ordered, but was again...sorely disappointed.

Service: horrendous. Our server literally hated her life or her job.

Although the pizzas were enjoyed by everyone around the table, but the other ancillary dishes were subpar, the poutine, not with poutine cheese. The wings were bland.

Beers: pricey, but again, had plenty of selection so everyone eventually found their top choice. $2 tiny tiny flights. There are many other breweries in the area that have better pricing and beer selection.

I will say we ended up sitting outside in the humidity even though there were 3 large tables inside that had no one sitting at them. They refused to let us sit there, by the time we left, 2 of those tables were still empty and remained open. I don't understand their thinking behind refusing us. We were a mix of all ethnicities and everyone was dressed well, so I don't know how they judged us to stick us outside rather than let us opt for the inside table.

Unfortunately, it was such a poor experience, will not be back. Hope for future customers to beware and proceed with caution. Happy eating and drinking!",2018-09-05 19:57:04,"{'food': ['pizza', 'poutine', 'wings'], 'drink': ['beer', 'wine', 'mixed drinks']}"

Large, thin/foldable, with the right amount of cheese/sauce and a crust you'll want to finish. The second time I walked in about 5-10 minutes after closing, but they still were down to sell whatever slices they had, so they seem like decent folk. Getting a pie should only be better, which I hope to do soon. They're a block away from Main st., so if you're in the area for the evening, they're quite accessible.

Edit: After having ordered a couple pies from them, as expected they were great. I have to say, the pies are smaller than expected, particularly given the largeness of their individual slices. I'd dock them a point for their pies being smaller than what I'd expect for a typical pie, and a bit pricier too ($16). Oh well :\  If you overlook that though, you're in for a delicious treat. For myself personally, they were the tastiest NY style pizzas I've had in Philly thus far. Cheese, sauce and crust were all on point (I was really surprised by the crust...it's hard to find crust this tasty around here). I have to mention that they do this strange swirly thing with the sacuce/cheese, so that they're next to each other, and not layered on top of  one other (it's kind of like a margarita pie, except in a swirl instead of in splotches). Don't worry about that, the texture and tastes is just fine when you take a big bite into it. 

Anyhow, TL;DR  if you're in the Manayunk/Roxborough area, I highly recommend making them your go-to pizza place.",2015-08-20 16:02:21,"{'food': ['pizza'], 'drink': []}"

This was our first time venturing for ramen.  I hopped onto yelp and decided to head over here.  I remember reading about this place on foobooz before so i was curious.  Plus it seemed more fun than the other ramen places.  It was almost a perfect night.  We got parking right across the street and seated immediately at the bar.  Sad to say i kept on bumming elbows with the woman next to me.  I wish there was a bit more elbow room.  Note to the owners: elbow room is a necessity when eating noodles!  Just try eating with your elbows tucked in, not so fun eh?!?  Also, i would have to minus points for the bartender.  He served me a flight of the sake (one was soju).  However, he did not shake the sake.  It was a nigori, i mean how could he not know.  Sad to say i just let it go, usually i would have mentioned something but it was just a shot.  Okay i've vented.

We ordered the mung bean and the chicken bun.  Both were delicious and the bun was not of the white dough kind that was expected.  This one was more of the brown flakey kind.  Nevertheless it was good and i would order it again.  They did forget to bring out the special cheeseburger bun that the bf ordered.  Next was the garlic flavored wings.  The carnivorous bf devoured it.  I had the smoked fish ribs.  This has got to be one of the best thing i ever ate.  It was a paku which is a cousin of the piranha.  The dish was very flavorful. The skin was crispy and perfect.  It was definitely a party in my mouth.  We ordered the pork and miso cod ramen.  The cod was cooked perfectly with a little crispness.  The noodles were cooked al dente, it was great.  The broth was mediocre, i'm trying to remember it but there was really nothing memorable about it.  The bf finished his bowl completely.

The noodles were hard, clumped together and I didn't get enough broth with my ramen. Good thing I was very hungry, otherwise I wouldn't have finished eating the miso ramen.

My school's end of the year dinner was located at this place and the name rang a bell. After thinking about it more, I realized I have been here before about 5 years ago for a birthday party. At that time, I remember it being delicious and it was something unique because we ate with our hands. Also there were belly dancers there! 

When I went again recently (a week ago), I had an emergency so I had to leave right after. I called the restaurant earlier in the day to let them know I probably would not be able to make it. But the owner insisted I came in to get the food packed. I obliged, and glad I did! 

We had a party of 25 at least, and we all got seated at around 3 huge round tables upstairs. I stayed for the appetizer, which was actually just what I had remembered 5 years ago! And just as delicious. Good to know that some things don't change :) This was just #1 in our 7 course meal that we had gotten as a group. 

I had to leave after this meal and asked for a to-go box. To my surprise, I got 5 boxes to take home. I went back and opened each box. I got plenty of food. I got the chicken, which was marinated so delicious. I also got lamb, which at first I was hesistant about since I don't enjoy lamb particularly, but I don't know what it was, but this lamb was ...differently marinated? cooked differently? I'm not sure what it was, but I kept eating the lamb! It was so good! First time I will say that. 

I also got some desserts- a egg dessert with a pastry covering it, it was something I've never had before, but very delicious. 

And then I topped it off with the dessert, which was a honey, very sweet, dessert- it was delicious, but I couldn't see myself eating too much of it because it was very sweet, but the amount he gave me was perfect. 

I had forgotten about this place, but ever since coming here again, I would definitely think of this place again, especially for big parties. The owner was so nice and gave me such a good amount of food to eat. He was very nice about the whole situation. The variety of food is also just so good. I'll come back again for sure!

We pull up and race to the entrance, just as the rain seems to be getting heavier. A small outdoor ""foyer"" guards the front door, New York style, which leads into a small, cozy dining room thronged with seated diners. Old-time photographs line the walls, proving that celebrities ranging from Teddy Roosevelt to Frank Sinatra have visited (and evidently loved) Ralph's. Faded patterned wallpaper looks like it belongs in your grandparents' Victorian mansion. Ornate ceiling tiles gleam overhead. The place oozes traditional, old-school vibes, and I fully expect to see men in pinstripe suits with one hand tucked in the breast pocket at all times.

MB chats with the host, who seats us promptly at a four-top near the entrance. The occasional blast of cold nighttime air hits us when other patrons enter (it is a virtual downpour now) but it gets warmer as the night wears on. Our server is friendly, gruff, and full of good humor. He takes our drink order (Yuengling for me), then rattles off the specials for the evening with lightning-round precision. Everyone opts to start with some kind of appetizer, but I'm still reeling from our stint at Mac's. I need a reprieve from meat (if only momentary). The ""spring salad"" sounds good, so I go with that: spicy arugula; sliced rings of red onion (which I shuffle off to the side); quartered, juicy Roma tomatoes; chunks of tangy gorgonzola; tart balsamic dressing. All that freshness does wonders, clearing my taste buds for more traditional Italian fare.

I'm ready for pasta now, and I'm a sucker for good gnocchi. This place looks like there may be a little old lady somewhere in back--grandma, let's say--hand crafting each seashell-like piece. Seems like a safe bet. I'm back on the carnivore train again, so I get the tomato meat sauce. The bowl arrives nearly overflowing with bright red sauce covering the pale gnocchi. There are green bits of herb in there, but not overwhelming. I try a nibble. Good, but not great. The gnocchi wavers from being slightly undercooked to perfectly cooked (it may have finished cooking under the sauce, so that's forgivable). It's a solid, if plain, dish with no real diversion from textbook Italian cuisine. A standby, if you will. It is satisfying, though. I do my best to eat most of it before setting aside my fork. The house chianti washes it down nicely. Again, no bells and whistles with the wine either.

While the rest of the table decides to end with coffee and cannoli, I'm good with just some espresso to fill in the cracks. (That's a good thing; no one else seems that impressed with the cannoli.) In the end, a one-time visit to Ralph's seems sufficient to get the gist. Solid food with little flair, adhering to time-honored recipes. The rain has stopped finally, and we're able to depart without getting soaked. Time to sleep...but not with the fishes.

Vetri Cucina helped make our anniversary meal very special.  We frequent a lot of tasting menu restaurants, and enjoy being led by the chef's selections - but sometimes you get a dish that doesn't quite fit with your dietary preferences (as opposed to allergies).  Vetri Cucina's system of allowing you to look at the 20 or so potential dishes for the night and to let the kitchen know which dishes you DO NOT and which dish might be a MUST HAVE allows the kitchen to create a tasting menu tailored just for you.  They also do not serve each person in your party the same menu.  This allowed my wife and I to basically share a 13 course tasting menu, instead of 6 or 7 courses.  Service was very informed and outstanding.  The restaurant itself is located in a renovated brownstone, so it has a very homey feel to it.

The tuna crudo and prosciutto dishes were my favorite antipasta courses.  The pastas were the real standout dishes.  My favorite was the Fetuccelle (cross between fettuccine and parpadelle) with porcini and blueberry.  The pasta was perfect and the sauce was an interesting combination of the earthiness of the mushrooms and the sweetness of the blueberry.  My wife enjoyed the malfadine with braised beef ragu.  Very meaty and very flavorful.  

For the ""secondi"" courses, we were served the porcelet and the veal dishes.  Both were very tasty, but at this point in the meal we were getting pretty full, and we wished we would had been served the seafood course (snapper) to lighten up the meal a bit.

He said something along the lines of ""Curse God for bringing fire to mankind"" and then lit our tray for our food.

I was surprised by how empty the restaurant was, given that it was prime brunch time. The inside of the restaurant is modern looking, but with exposed pipes and a hipster twist. We were seated by the large windows in a booth overlooking the street. With the warm September light streaming in, it was the perfect brunch atmosphere. 

I ordered the 24 Brunch, which consisted of two eggs (any style), potato hash, focaccia bread, and bacon. Though the individual components of the meal was typical diner-brunch fare, the quality of the ingredients was high and relatively affordable ($10.00). The focaccia bread, shaped into sticks, was thick and pillowy with nice herb flavoring and a toasted shell. The eggs were cooked medium-hard, like I'd requested, and the potato hash was solid, but not anything special. In hindsight, I wish that I had ordered my eggs sunny side-up like my friend, so that I could dip the focaccia in the egg. Relative to the rest of the meal, there was a lot of focaccia bread. The portion sizes were substantial, but not generous. What surprised me the most about the meal was the bacon. The bacon wasn't cooked in any special way that I was aware of, but it was delicious.

The tea was standard, and my gin-based cocktail was tasty (though a little difficult to drink as it contained lots of pieces of fruit which competed with the ice cubs for falling out onto my nose as I tried to sip).  But the food...oh it was awesome!  I've been craving Chinese for a while, and this more than satisfied my cravings in a way that cheap fast-food take-out never could.

The food is arranged by how hot and spicy it is, from a 1 (not hot) to a 10 (mouth on fire).  My group chose what we thought would be a fairly safe, not spicy level of 3--and found ourselves unprepared for the peppers.  Next time I'll go for a 1, but I'll definitely go back.

We had a tasting menu which included a huge variety of dishes.  Appetizers ranged from scallion pancakes (flakey and buttery goodness!), to pork dumplings (mouth on fire burning!), a cucumber salad, pork lo mein, and other savory/spicy dishes.  By the time the entrees arrived, most everyone at my table was more than halfway to being full, but the array of foods to sample was enough to entice us to continue eating.  The sweet honey-batter shrimp, snow-pea leaves, stir-fried green beans with pork and chicken with sticky rice were all amazing.  The meats were well marinated and practically melted in my mouth (beef, pork, chicken--all were excellently prepared!).  The vegetables were crisp and the sauces tangy.  It was an excellent meal, only dimmed by the fact that this place doesn't serve dessert! (As I live for sugar, I find this somewhat blasphemous)

While it was fairly crowded when we arrived at 7 on a Wednesday night, the service was still attentive and the food delivered promptly.  Our attentive waiter was great (filled our water glasses when they were less than an inch from the top, always asking how things tasted, etc.).  By the time we left (sometime around 8:30-8:45) the bar area and dining area were both packed, evidence as to how popular this place is.

This isn't 1997 in some NBC studio though.  It is 2013.  It is real life where I am a girl who gave up on the feeling of ever being sufficiently caffeinated.  Long gone are the days when a simple cup of coffee could give me a flutter in my heart and some gas in my tank.  I know caffeine is a drug because it used to make me so high and by high I mean euphoric.  It is a legal drug afterall and boy was I an addict.

Nowadays, I settle on just functioning with a cup of coffee and Dunkin and Wawa are acceptable means to an end.  I haven't felt the surge of caffeine in years, but this week that changed.  On a quick lunch break, I was treated to the presence of Aaliyah P (who delivers a burst of energy to all who surround her anyway).  She bought me my first cup of iced coffee from La Colombe.  I was happy to see simple syrup and all sorts of fun additives to make an already cup of iced joe better.  

Back at the office, I began to feel something.  That flutter in my heart that left me in my early 20's after all my all-nighters came back to me.  I didn't know I could feel this way again.  And of course, I needed to feel it again and again like a true addict.  So 2 days later I went back and found myself in a blissful state again. it only cost me $2...I'm done for.  Sure, this too will pass and I will become numb again, but for now, I have found my liquid joy again.

When I called back, I was asked for a credit card to hold the reservation and that if I cancelled I would be charged the full amount of the reservation and issued a gift card in that amount. 

The best part was when I then said to cancel my reservation, the girl on the phone said ""you mean you don't want to keep your reservation???"" As though she was shocked and that how dare I cancel at this top notch restaurant. Absolutely rude and condescending. 


I have no problem using a credit card for a reservation. My problem is that this policy is nowhere on their website, and they all of a sudden need a credit card. In my opinion, they saw a demand for tables and decided to enact this policy. They waited until a week before Thanksgiving so that people would not have a choice. Well guess what - we do have a choice. I booked my table of 8 elsewhere, AND happily left a card number to confirm, because this was made known on the original reservation call.

Thankfully, neither scenario happened, and I was privileged to finally dine there last night. 

With that being said, I obviously preemptively put Vetri Cucina on a pedestal surrounded with unrealistic hype. I had butterflies the moments leading up to my visit of combined sheer giddiness and nerves, that I would somehow be let done. I'm ecstatic to report that my dining experience at Vetri was one of the top dining experiences of my lifetime, and I found it to be truly everything everyone says it is, and more. 

Upon entry to the restaurant, I was actually a little uncertain. The hallway was narrow, and I had to walk through a crowd to get to the hostess stand. That literally was the lowlight of the evening, and that's not even horrible. Every aspect of the evening was stellar from there-on-out. 

Where to begin? Well, to start, I wish I was taking notes. Our server was so knowledgeable that I wish I could've written down everything he said about the food and the wine. The wine paring was extraordinary from the thorough to description to the actual pairing. I had the six-pour pairing and I'd absolutely recommend going that route. I didn't view the actual list until after the meal, I didn't realize that they literally listed the wines and dishes they paired with on the page. This is a great keepsake, and guide for my own future pairings. 

After our aperol spritz, we started with a few ""snacks"" and a vegetable crudités platter for the table. We passed the veggies and helped ourselves to the snacks from the center of the table. Our next course, after the bread, was our antipasti. I didn't realize the plate in front of me was my tuna crudo, and mine alone. Theoretically, a group could share and pass everything. We did, to some extent, however we mostly ate the plate in front of us. Based on specific wine pairings, this does make sense.  

Taking a step back, before our tasting journey began, our server gave us some time to discuss the menu and our preferences. I was told to ""not be shy"" if there was something I really wanted to try. While the tasting menu had the element of surprise at every course, the meal was centered around that initial conversation with the server. From just looking at the menu, there were a few standouts that I simply needed to try. 

After the antipasti- we moved on to multiple rounds of pasta. Mamma mia! The swiss chard gnocchi with brown butter was one of the most exquisite things I've ever eaten in my entire life. The gnocchi melted in my mouth as the flavor of the brown butter sauce lingered. This was served with the tortellini with truffle sauce that would've been a knockout on its own. I received the mafaldini with lamb shank ragu as my second pasta course. This was my must-have, and while delicious, the gnocchi still takes the cake. Special shout out to the delectable seafood in the tonnarelli al Frutti di mare that I sampled for one of the other plates

At this point in the meal, I was starting to hurt, however there was no looking back. No food down, no food left behind. Of course, I had to sample the next round of bread that came out- the sourdough. No regrets either. 

I rallied in time for our secondi; in my case, the milk fed veal with asparagus- yet another standout from my initial menu review. I've said this before about veal, however, we have a new winner. This was the BEST veal I've had in my life. We had two different preparations of this tender, tender meat. One was more tender and filet-like, the other was delectably fattier with a slight crisp. There was a dollop of sauce, however I preferred the veal in its own juices. 

Finally, we reached dessert status. Based on our groups eagerness to try everything, our server ended up bringing us one of each dessert option. The pistachio flan was placed in front of me, and the pistachio that oozed out of the flan upon dipping my fork was a highlight. We literally based the plates around the table and it was great to try a little of everything. I hit crazy status when the little pastry tray was placed in the center. Did I need to try one of everything? Probably not, but when at Vetri, you try to eat it all. 

While the food was phenomenal, the staff added to the entire experience. Aside from our fantastic server, the team work and collaboration of guest service was apparent. We had so many people interacting with us throughout the meal that were aiming to please and perfectly harmonized with the actions of their colleagues. 

I was smiling on the outside and smiling on the inside. This meal is a true highlight in my culinary life.  So, I'm so thrilled the world isn't ending and I'm not dying. While I've checked a major item off my bucket list, it's only left me with the taste for more of the finer Vetri Cucina dining experience.",2018-06-21 17:52:08,

I did however enjoy the whitefish salad snacks at the bar. Anyway, recently I had been hearing a lot of positive things about the place, so I gave it another chance. 
I went for dinner on a Friday night, and there was a half-hour wait for a table, which really isn't bad. My friends and I got cherry bourbon cocktails from the bar, and they were very delicious. When it was time to be seated, it turned out that we had to close that tab before going to our table, which was time consuming and a little annoying.

The first owner did an amazing job and this restaurant was famous in the Korean community - everyone who loved soon dubu knew this place was their go-to. However, owners changed somewhere along the way and the quality of the soondubu went down drastically. The flavors changed, there was less tofu, less seafood in the haemul soon dubu, and the somethin flavor was off.

Last year I gave it another try on a cold day and I was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant was really good again! They put in the right amount of spice (4 out of 5), it was a bit sparse on the seafood again, but plenty of tofu. I went a few more times after that, and the last couple visits I noticed the quality go down again.

I just went again with my [Korean] parents and was so disappointed that I don't think I will be coming here again for awhile. My dad got the clam soon dubu (level 2 spice) and it was ALRIGHT but maybe because it wasn't spicy. My mom ordered the doenjang soon dubu and it was just salty. There was no flavor and no substance I thought I was tasting super concentrated ocean water with soft tofu. My mom couldn't take more than 2 spoons because of how ridiculously salty the was. I ordered the haemul soondubu as usual (level 4 spice), and the seafood was sparse masked by a ton of tofu while the flavor was also a little off. Also, due to kitchen renovations the rice was not served in dolsot (stone pots) which was a huge part of my soon dubu experience.

To top off the decrease in quality of the food, we asked [multiple times] for plastic containers to bring home the leftovers but was told that those containers were only for take out customers. Instead, we were given these small foam containers that were could easily get crushed. We asked for one more plastic bag just to pack our leftovers separately but they insisted on only one bag per customer even though there were 3 people with 3 separate orders.

The menu was limited and there was definitely some false advertising on the part of the restaurant because the website indicates ""all you can drink bloody marys and mimosas for $20 + 1 entree"" but when we arrived the waitress told us $25. 

The food was ""meh"". I was unimpressed by the turkey bacon benedict I ordered, and the egg white omelette and salmon benedict the others ordered were all quite bland.

What can I say, I am obsessed with the food here, and my goal is to try every single dish in the menu.  Unfortunately I am a long way from reaching that goal as I tend to order the same dishes each time because I can't help myself, namely Prah-Hok Kateeh and Sah-Law Machue Yuin.  I have tried a few new dishes since my last review, see below:

Pan Fried Tilapia with Ginger Sauce - my new second favorite dish, after Prah-Hok Kateeh!  They gave you an option to either get a whole fish, two filets or one filet.  We opted for one filet so that we can order more dishes.  I definitely want to get a whole fish next time.  The fish was perfectly breaded and seasoned, it was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The star of the dish was the ginger sauce, it was perfection.  I love the different notes in the sauce, including sweet, sour and a hint of spiciness.  I would be happy with a bucket of this sauce and a bowl of rice.  

Nkahp-Ch'in - I've never had frog legs before (I know, bad Asian!), and was hesitate to try it, but the dish looked so delectable that I had to give it a try.  I think the frog legs being fried really helped, I mean everything taste good fried no?  It kind of tasted like chicken, but with less meat.  I liked the batter and the sauce that came with the dish, but I am not sure I would try this dish again. 

Pleak Sak-Koe - I saw that a lot of people on Yelp recommended this dish and decided to try it.  The dish is basically thinly sliced beef that comes with a side of lettuce and basil to eat as a wrap, kind of like Korean BBQ style.  I was not a big fan of the dish as the meat was a bit bland, a rarity as nearly all of the other dishes I've tried have been burst with flavor.  I think this would be a good dish for someone who is new to South Asian food and not used to all of the bold flavors.

The four of us polished off 8 dishes the last time we came here.  Despite a few misses, I still think this is one of my favorite restaurants of all time.  If only I can convince the family to move to NYC and open up the restaurant here.

Our servers kept checking in on us, but did not get to the point were it became annoying. 

We dined on a Friday night, so we got the grand tasting menu with the wine pairing (a $90 supplement).  They presented us with the options that were being made that night and asked if there was anything that we would or would not eat on the menu.  

The amuse were a great start:
-Beet Salad: Ok, although I'm not sure how it was an amuse.
-Tomato and Red Pepper Cold Soup: Fantastic.  I only wish I could get a large bowl with lump crab on top.  I could eat this everday.
-Corn Pudding:  Very Good.
-Squab Fritter:  Very good.  It was my wife's favorite amuse.
-Foie Pastrami on toast.  Simply amazing.  I love foie and I love pastrami.  They two combined could have not been any better.

We then had a variety of smaller dishes that were different for me and my wife (which is great, so we can try more of the options):

Highlights:
-Foie Pastrami
-Sweet Onion Crepe.  Best thing we ate that night.
-Spinach Gnocci.  A Vetri classic.  It is unfair to compare any other gnocchi to these.  Simply amazing.
-Wine.  All the wine was perfectly paired with each dish.  All from Italy.  A great bargain.  Definitely worth it.
-Desserts.  Chocolate Polenta cake and peach and blackberry upside down cake were amazing.

Lowlights:
-Sardine.  Probably my mistake for not taking this off the table.  I'm not a huge sardine fan.
-Porchetta stuffed with Cherries:  I just wasn't a fan.

Overall:  Definitely a great experience and a must eat in Philly.  Hands down the best Italian I've ever had (including Italy).

In response to another post below:
Contrary to what another poster said, I think the amount of food was perfect.  We walked out full, but not feeling gross.  The portion sizes here are much more realistic than Per Se.  Walking out of Per Se, I wanted to vomit due to the large quantity of rich, buttery food and large number of courses.  Also, I'm not sure how you can compare the two on price, since my bill at Per Se for two was over twice what I paid at Vetri.  I'm not saying this is better than Per Se, but I don't think you can compare the two. They are two different styles of food, atmosphere (I had to wear a tie at Per Se), price, etc.",2010-07-10 13:36:17,"{'food': ['Beet Salad', 'Tomato and Red Pepper Cold Soup', 'Corn Pudding', 'Squab Fritter', 'Foie Pastrami on toast'], 'drink': ['Wine']}"

I ordered the chicken parm over spaghetti, a chicken salad sandwich, and a grilled chicken gyro. I was feeling hungry ;)

The chicken parm had a good sauce. The chicken was tasty, but it looked of rather low quality (think 1999 McDonald's Chicken McNugget). The gyro was overfilled with the sauce - it was dripping everywhere. and the chicken that was used on that similarly looked ... fake. It tasted okay, but within 30 minutes I did not feel.

I see why this place has such high reviews - food tastes good (least the chicken parm did); and my order was ready within 15 minutes - impressive.

I'll give them larger, but if this is what you call meaty, the pickings are pretty slim, I actually burned calories trying to eat these things!

Our server Linda, was a gem, she was friendly, helpful and knew how to guide us through the menu as this was our first visit. Five big shiny stars for her service! The food however was a different story... 

Hubby started with a bowl of clam chowder, which was loaded with potatoes and tender clams, but nothing else, the consistency was good, however it really lacked in flavor, it needed so much more, perhaps onions, celery, I stirred in one pat of butter ( Paula Deen approved ) a little salt and pepper and that still did not do the trick, so I repeated this same procedure, but it really did not help.

Philadelphia is known for Snapper soup, but this tasted sour, the meat was tender and plentiful and a poor quality sherry was served on the side. We each took one bite and decided we would pass. The crab imperial stuffed mushroom caps were okay, but expensive, four small mushroom caps and I do mean small were filled with the imperial for ten dollars.

My two pounds of garlic crabs were all work and no play, but plenty of messing around trying to get out the minimal amount of meat, I was tempted to pick up those babies and start sucking the meat out of them! No more blue crabs for me, I'll stick with the dungeness, snow or Alaskan crabs from now on, better yet, saute me some pure lump crab meat in a little garlic and butter. I will give them this the garlic and red pepper sauce was outstanding, they should bottle it.

Hubby had the seafood imperial with crab, scallops and bay shrimp, which was a very rich but small portion and we both agreed it not only smelled very fishy, but tasted fishy as well, after two or three bites we decided to bring it home for the cat, but she was not thrilled enough to eat it either.

They have a full bar and a happy hour, my margarita was not very good, mostly bottled margarita mix. The hostess was not very friendly, well she was okay with us, but I had to giggle when two young girls moved from a table to a booth and she screamed at them "" you can not just seat yourselves!""

The interior is modest, yet clean and accommodating.  There are only a few tables in front of the kitchen, maybe nine total, but there isn't really a feeling of being squeezed in.  The interior is a warming red hue and on the wall facing the street there is a large flat-screen television mounted, which lightens the mood from serious/romantic to more of a casual vibe.  Alcohol is not served here, but I was informed that the restaurant is a B.Y.O.B. establishment.  The prices seem to underline the casual nature of the restaurant; I think my bill for a 'traditional khmer dish' came out to just under $9.  You'd be able to easily feed two people with such a dish + appetizer for $12-14 dollars.

The dish I ordered, saw-law macheu kre'ung with beef and tripe tasted like a home cooked meal.  The clear broth had a fine sediment of lemongrass, galangal and spices that tells the tale of long hours simmering.  As someone who enjoys cooking, I can tell the difference between a bullion base and a true home-made broth and this was certainly the latter.  The broth stained yellow with turmeric on the napkin as I sipped the slightly spicy-sour broth between bites of water spinach and fall-apart-tender pieces of what I believe was short-rib beef.  There was also an herb in the mix I couldn't quite place, though I believe it could have been morning glory.  The tripe, which I should mention is completely optional, added just the right amount of assertive gaminess to it and was not at all chewy.  It added a nice change of pace to the unctuous bites of beef and the fibrous crunch of the water spinach, so I highly recommend you add the tripe if you're on the fence about including it or not.  The end result was a deeply satisfying meal that was nutritious, exotic and delicious.

The young gentleman who waited on my table was clearly working multiple roles in the restaurant, which is a family-run operation.  I found him to be polite and quite rightfully passionate about his family's food.  There weren't many customers as it was still early in the evening, so I have yet to see how they operate under duress, but I found that I had a great deal of attention.  I asked his opinion on what a newcomer with no fears should order and he obliged.  I was also given a complementary cleaver-minced chicken, herbs and celery dish that had a deepness to it that must have been toasted rice powder.  This treatment does make me think more than a little bit that I could have been mistaken for a professional food critic...  but perhaps that is a cynical thought.

I highly recommend trying out this restaurant sooner rather than later as it is bound to get a great deal of exposure very soon.  The young gentleman who waited on my table spoke of outdoor grilling, room expansions and menu additions in the very near future.  If they can keep up this level of quality for the huge potential crowds, this modest corner-restaurant has the potential to become a popular foodie-stop in the near future (if it hasn't already!)  I'll be back with friends and family for sure... especially if they turn on that industrial strength steamer next to the front desk during the winter.",2012-08-19 23:22:07,

I have been there several times in the past and generally leave pretty happy and with a satisfied belly. Well, last night was surely NOT one of those experiences. Let me take you through the evening....

We were a party of 15....had reservations for about 2 months in advance

1. Arrive at 7:30--meet with friends, buckets are on the table for beer....good start

2. 7:40 Give menus and looking for apps; we notice other guests eating ribs but don't see them on menu. We ask server and she says, 'oh that's our special.' Doesn't proceed to actually tell us about the special, but, we order it. The BBQ ribs. They are typically an entree, but we were hungry so ordered one to eat as an app. The plan was to share with the table. 

3. 8:30- It's now been almost an hour. Other apps came out to others in our parties, the ribs never come. We ask what is taking so long and she says that they are thick and take a long time to cook. (I've worked in many restaurants throughout the city....BBQ ones at that...I know ribs. They are pre-cooked. You heat them and throw sauce on them.) At this point we have already ordered entrees because it was taking so long that we wanted to make sure we weren't eating at midnight. So....at this point we say ok forget the ribs as an app, send them with all of the entrees. 

4. 9:15 the ribs arrive with SOME of the other entrees. They were 4 pieces of rib, a scope of rice and sauteed veggies. This is what we waiting 1 hour and 45 mins for?!?! AND paid $22. You must be kidding. 

5. I ordered the vegetable roti.  It was ice cold when I got it. I looked around for a server to ask for it to be heated.....NO servers outside. I continued to sip on my beer (the only good thing of the evening) and waited til a server walked by. After about 10 mins still NO server outside. I walk inside and see I server. I simply ask if it can be heated up. She said, 'go find a manager. He's in the kitchen wearing a yellow shirt. tell him.' I said, 'I don't feel comfortable walking into the kitchen.' She says, 'no, its ok.' As this is happening, the bus boy is walking by and he says, 'I'll take it for you.' He takes my food, places it on top of his dirty, full bus tub and walks it to the kitchen. Ummmmm..... (It does get heated up quickly and returned to table...it was ok tasting...)

6. A friend at the table ordered the jerk shrimp skewers at a hefty $20. I don't mind spending money on food, but good food. Not food that is sitting in mass quanity in the back....but the best part is....HE NEVER GOT THE SHRIMP. At around 9:45 when a server FINALLY comes around we ask where it's at...she looks at her notepad....doesn't say anything and walks back inside. Oppps. He had to follow her inside and cancel the order. 

7. The bill comes. $486 for 11 people. We split it...so $44 bucks a person. I could go to some of the nicest restarants in philly and get a tasting menu for almost that prince. And remember...it's a byob...so that did not include alcohol. 

I didn't expect fine dining or amazing food. But...I expected 'good.' What I got was....Goodbye, Jamaican Jerk Hut. At this rate, you won't last much longer. 

PS. There were several other large parties seated near us....and needless to say...it was QUITE obvious they were having a similar experience. I heard both tables continually ask where the food was and have to confirm orders with servers because they were not getting the correct food. 

It seems that the main root of the prob was the kitchen. Oh and let's update the website too. You're prices are several dollars cheaper on your website than on the menu.",2012-08-19 12:40:07,"{'food': ['BBQ ribs', 'vegetable roti', 'jerk shrimp skewers'], 'drink': []}"

I typically enjoy the events in the city that bring people together... this, however, reminded me of Mardi Gras back around Y2K when i literally didn't have to put my feet on the ground... the volume of people would just pick me up and carry me!  I managed to walk over just fine.  Even at 4th and Bainbridge, it was tame.  Turning that corner at 6:30pm was INSANE!  

I tried to be a good sport... I met up with some friends.  We divided and conquered to get some variety, and then we were to meet up and share.  Well, we never found eachother again.  I got put in charge of cheese curds at The Cow and the Curd.  I hopped in line and waited about 5 minutes.  The guy working the truck said 'next' and the woman at the front of the line was not paying attention.  He asked again, she did nothing.  Nobody nudged her, or cut around her... so finally the guy just looked at us (towards the end of the line) and said 'there's no line... come order'.  So the back of the line rushed the window, the front of the line got pretty upset about it, and i found myself arguing with a 12 year old over cheese curds.  I quickly realized how pathetic and ridiculous this was, and decided that I no longer had a taste for fried cheese... from a truck that is ALWAYS out and about in the city ANYWAY!!!  I was, however, in need of a drink... so i grabbed a sixpoint which brought me back down to only hating things a little bit.  I found Nomad Pizza around 2nd and South, got 1/2 a pie, ate it while enjoying a band that I wished would have played more covers, finished my sixpoint, and got the hell out of there.

I did see Enid reping the yelp table which was lookin' good.  I got a little pang of pride walking by there.  I tried to come over and say hi... but the jet-stream of people wouldn't allow for it.  I tried to slam on the brakes and got rear-ended by an oblivious suburban-mom on the phone pushing a double-wide stroller.  No urban mother would EVER invest in the double-wide!!!

Yes, it is true that Vetri now only offers the full tasting menu at $135 a head. Add in the wine tasting menu, and you're over $200 a person, not factoring in tax and tip. I thought I was being clever, so I decided to forgo the wine and pregame with a few pints at Monk's a few blocks away. Not the classiest of things to do, but dealing with my lack of class is something I have to do every day.

Be aware that the menu changes seasonally. They offer you a menu with several options for each course, so expect to get any one of those items. You can inform your server if you have any particular preferences or diet restrictions, and they are very accommodating. My dining companion and I received different items for nearly the entire meal, so I was able to sample about 11 different dishes. 

If you see the spinach gnocchi, order it. Marc Vetri is a master of pasta, but even this is out of the ordinary for him. The gnocchi melts in your mouth, releasing the fresh spinach that is somehow still slightly crisp. The golden onion sweet crepe with white truffle fondue is also completely mind-blasting. Everything from the seasonal vegetable plate to the post-meal macaroons was delicious and perfectly executed, with excellent service and ambiance to match.

The only sour taste I got was the one left in my mouth when presented with the bill (incidentally, they also miscalculated *slightly* and almost charged us $200 extra!). But quality isn't always easy to come by, so start collecting your loose change (or loose Benjamins) and, please, direct yourself to Vetri.",2011-07-29 20:42:26,

The view! Omg, the view of Philadelphia is amazing and totally worth it! 

The food is absolutely fantastic. Very pricey but totally worth it. 

I had the spare ribs with roasted carrots and potatoes. My husband had the tuna with a poached egg and a delicious clam sauce. We shared fries dipped first in the mayo sauce and then dipped in house steak sauce. Delicious! We cleaned our entire plates! I'd like to note that the ribs are first braised which makes them tender and slow cooked and then they are grilled. Grilling helps hold the meat together. From a culinary aspect, the texture is easier to cut and hold together on a fork which makes eating much easier. Just braised would be delicious but fall apart which means you'd need a spoon rather than a fork to pick it up. 

Dessert we ordered the toasted cinnamon crunch. My husband had to have it because of the Krispy Kreme donuts used to make the ice cream. It was accompanied by some crunchy cinnamon brioche bits, toasted hazelnuts, and some sort of cinnamon whipped dollops.  Overall, delicious. Very sweet. 

I was disappointed there wasn't a single chocolate dessert option other than a chocolate sorbet. 

We loved every minute, ate every bite! Soooooo delicious. For all that  our bill was just under $90. Again, pricey but worth it since this was our special dinner while visiting Philly.

My company got a group of about 15 together for business meetings yesterday & today with colleagues from NJ, NY & PA, so we all arrived at different times via plane, train & car. We arrived yesterday morning for all-day meetings in one of the private conference rooms at the hotel & stayed the night at the hotel. From arrival to departure, the service from the staff here was exceptional.

David, the bellman, greeted me outside before I even had 1 foot out of the taxi. He took me straight to the check-in counter.

Jamie & Emily at the front desk assisted with my check-in and were SO cheerful and friendly! 

Duc, one of the food banquet guys, was my favorite of all. Since we were in the Anthony Conference Room on floor 3 for business meetings, we had catered lunch, drinks & snacks from the hotel. Duc was super attentive to our needs, came to refill waters & sodas from the table, set up the lunch table, & I was convinced he was psychic. Every time one of us would look around in need of something, Duc just had the uncanny super power of knowing what we needed (location of restrooms for example). Duc is awesome!!!

The rooms were HUGE, super clean, nicely decorated, new appliances & the soap products smell SO good. The bed was probably the biggest bed I have ever slept in. I should have slept horizontally to fully utilize the bed space. Fresh flowers in the lobby and a very pleasant experience upon arrival and every time we would walk through the lobby.

I've always had a decent experience, good margaritas and good food, the wait was never good but tolerable. 

Well tonight, 12/29/17, we asked for a table of 6, we were told 40 minutes wait time which was fine, we get it people probably had cabin fever and they were busy. We scurried to the bar area, congregated at the corner ordered drinks, even got a pitcher of margaritas. The bar servers were great. 70 minutes lates, we were finally seated. 

We got our appetizers, they were great then we ordered our entrees. Three of us got fajitas, 2 out of 3 were cold. One of three that was hot. But the hot fajitas had such a tiny steak on it. 2 of us did not want to complain, we weren't there to get free food but eventually one of our friend did say something. Our server, Ashley, was great and she got the manager. He solved the situation by getting me a fajitas that was hotter, the way it's supposed to be. He brought out another steak for my friend. The food runner with the pink hair dropped off my hot fajitas but the literally dropped the plate of tortillas, sour cream and guacamole as if she was bothered by our complaint in front of my friend.

I finally was rewarded with the deliciously greasy but gourmet 500 burger experience!

I got the 500 burger and I was not disappointed. It's a sexy looking burger - a little tall, plump with promise & bright with color.  While it looks small it is thick and dense. The meat is juicy and flavorful (aka there was a fair amount of grease/juice running out of each my bites). It comes on a brioche bun which was a bit dry... 
The 500 also comes with bacon and well you can't really go wrong with bacon ... ;) 
The special sauce was decent but nothing special. I would have liked to see some hot sauce offerings. 

Three types of fries - plain, spicy and truffle... Say No More! Truffle fries?! Yes please.

I was visiting philly from NY with my mother and wanted to have a nice steak dinner after wine tasting across the street. A guy in the wine ship told us the steaks at Marmont were good so we decided to try it boyyyyyy was that the wrong decision. 

Once we arrived we were immediately sat by the host who was very polite. Upon sitting the atmosphere was busy and a bit noisy as there was a large party celebrating an occasion over dinner. We placed our orders for the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the pepper crusted NY Strip Steak along with some sides. 

Our drinks came promptly, the food took about 40 minutes. That was a little long but expected since we ordered steaks. While we waited for our food to arrive things took a turn for the ABSOLUTE WORSE when the waiters decided to kick the large party off of their table and allow them to squeeze into their cramped bar located an arms length away from dining customers to continue the party. It suddenly turned into a frat party with intoxicated people who were still being served drinks screaming over each other and crowding around tables of people trying to enjoy their meal. 

I watched as a couple managed to get their meals down in 15 mins and promptly leave. Either way by the time we received our food I was ready to leave as none of the staff addressed this issue. They simply pushed through the crowd and continued working as if this was not a restaurant. 

The steaks were okay, just OK. They were a little over cooked and my ny strip steak was a bit salty maybe it was the crust of pepper seasoning. I wouldn't order it again...The filet was fine aside from it not being medium as requested. Once we received our food, I ignored the shortcomings of the dishes and kindly explained to our waiter that the bar shenanigans were unacceptable in a restaurant full of people spending a pretty penny on dinner. 

Instead of her immediately correcting the issue as I shouldn't have to state the obvious. She went on to tell me they were a large party celebrating as if that made it okay. After 20 minutes, more than halfway through my steak she comes back over to say the bar tender mentioned something to them although the frat party was still in full swing and she continued to serve them alcohol. 

At that point, another couple was ready to leave before ordering their main courses because of the noise and lack of management. We ended up hurrying out of there praying for the couple we left sitting next to us. 

If you like eating dinner in a frat house, go for it! I would never eat here again or recommend this place to anyone !!!!! Absolutely horrible.

There's not a lot of places within walking distance to even go eat at besides the usual pizza and sandwiches. However, I was a little disappointed. I'm a vegetarian so my opinion is a little bias, but the food was very average. You walk in and order on touch screens. They really need a ""build your own option"". The vegetarian options were very limited. I did however like that the veg options were pretty healthy. I went with the veg bowl which was average - filling because of the egg and quinoa but nothing special with the taste. Kinda salty too. We waited a long time for our food (considering it's supposed to ""fast""). They didn't offer any hot sauce or anything to fill up on the side - instead they had ketchup and mustard which is just so strange for a taco place.

Long overdue in writing this review. Have been to Lulu's a number of times--it's a close walk for us but somehow avoids some of the touristy scenes--hint they don't stand outside and solicit you to come eat there. 

So, let me give you the run down on how to order well at an Italian pizzeria: chianti, fiesta salad, pizza margherita, (both with homemade mozzarella!) finished with espresso.

Order some chianti by the glass--happy hour specials have been in action every time we go for late lunch.  Next, the Fiesta salad--perfect to share with two--is delicious with homemade fried zucchini spears, arugula and roasted red peppers. Add a pizza margherita to this order and you and your date are in Italy having an almost real Italian pizza.--sorry nothing actually comes close to the real thing, but this experience is the most accessible IMO and I lived in Italy.  At the end of our last pizza date, the very nice Italian man whose service is continental in every way (read non-obtrusive!) came to check on us.  When we asked about espresso, he looked at me as if to say, ""but of course!""  (I didn't see a big espresso machine so I thought they didn't have it.)  I'm not trying to over build it--it's just going for pizza, but if you want good pizza, this guy makes his own homemade fresh mozzarella--which just makes the pizza margherita.

Okay, add to all that two things:  

1.  Great space for large crowd with teens, vegetarians, etc.  (non-fussy, not super expensive for family crowd, everyone is happy)

2.  We just ordered delivery  tonight and hello under 30 minute delivery!  Great way to serve up great salad and pizza at home with no fuss.

found hairs in not one but THREE of our entrees. the server Kelly, acted from the start like she was being bothered and showed NO EFFORT in making it a nice and friendly experience. she was blahzay, eh, whatevs, attitude. never said sorry for the hairs when I brought them to her attention, instead accused us and said well how did the hair get on your fork?

We waited for a long time to the point where I was about to go in and get the manager. after I had told her our issue and the responses I got from her I knew at this point she was not going to do anything about it so I asked for the manager. 

he came out but again was not warm and friendly, comped what had hairs in it but that was it. I would have rather a sincere apology then what these guys did for us. 

if you were in my restauarants and had told me there were hairs in your food I would have been mortified, removed the dishes right away, and did whatever I could to have made the experience better not worse!

I also ordered the chicken formaggi for me, and an apple walnut salad for both of us.. I actually ordered this in person, not by phone.  When I got home with our food, I discovered that the container that was supposed to have salmon/veggies in it actually contained pasta with shrimp, scallops, & some miscellaneous veggies, but not a bit of salmon, asparagus, or potatoes.  The place was about 4 1/2 blocks from my apartment, and I didn't feel like walking back, plus it was late and we were both hungry, so my mom decided to eat what was given to her.

The food that I had at dinner was okay (pretty good sushi for the price). What wasn't fine was the way that I was treated when I called back the next morning (I'll explain). After leaving the restaurant the night before, I realized that I had accidentally left a large amount of cash on the table (not talking about the $6 cash tip I had also left for my $27 meal) before walking out and wasn't able to go back to retrieve it because I had left the restaurant at closing time. I called them back the next day as soon as they opened up and explained to them what had happened. While a very small part of me was hoping that I'd be able to get my money back, as it was pretty obvious that I had dropped it on the table by accident (I had set aside my cash tip with my receipt, so that extra cash wad was obviously not supposed to be there), I really just wanted them to at least speak nicely to me on the phone. However, I was met with a lot of confusion/disbelief by the man that I was talking to on the phone and eventually told to ""hold on."" The man went on to have multiple conversations with employees at the restaurant while I was still on the phone (no, I wasn't put on hold). Eventually, he came back on the phone call and told me that he had just asked all of the servers who were there the night before if they had picked up the amount of cash I had lost, but everyone had claimed not to. I nicely told the man on the phone that I had a feeling that my server was not telling the truth and most likely pocketed the money instead of splitting the tips with the rest of the servers (as they do at Crazy Sushi), because I remembered leaving the money on the table. Again, I was met with disbelief and an accusatory tone, then told to hold again. Like last time, I wasn't put on hold, and heard him and a woman screaming back and forth at each other, presumably about me. At that point, I was 100% sure that the man either knew that my server was lying about taking the money or that the money had been split amongst the servers at the end of the night. He eventually came back on the phone to tell me that he asked the servers again (which he couldn't have done since he was yelling the whole time) and they all claimed not to have picked up the money. 

Long story short, I simply wanted someone to be nice to me on the phone, regardless of the outcome -- it would have been nice to have received a simple apology for the possibility of my server picking up the money and pocketing it, as I knew that the money was probably long gone at that point. However, I was met with a lot of disbelief and an overall unprofessional, rude, and possibly dishonest attitude.",2018-06-26 21:05:28,"{'food': ['sushi'], 'drink': []}"

The PM experience was fine apart from higher prices than other whiskey joints in town and bus staff that will take your half full drink more than once. The server didn't want to replace them when he was alerted. It was definitely off-putting.  

The brunch service was less than stellar. The eggs - poached and fried - were a soupy, half raw mess. You always take a gamble with mods but when I ordered the crab benny sans the crab cake because my hungover stomach wasn't particularly feeling seafood, the sever neglected to tell me that he would be bringing me a $10 plate of two soupy poached eggs with sauce.

Jose Garce's restaurant, Village Whiskey, attempts to make burgers with his signature twist.  There are some highlights to my visit but I am afraid the main course, the village burger, was like many gourmet burgers, outstanding, but not a burger that stood out.  

Let's start out with the good: 
Fried shrimp appetizer:  Great crusty batter seasoned with a variety of spanish/ alittle cajun spices.  I tasted the celery seeds, oregano, and basil.  I really like the fried garlic.  It made this dish stood out.  However, the roumalade sauce was pretty standard.  In many ways, this dish reminds me of those delectable mini dishes we find in tapas bars.

The average: 
Duck Fat Fries:  To be frank, I thought the standard criteria for a good fry is for it to be golden brown and crispy.  I was curious how Village Whiskey can control the color and taste of the fries (i.e. like how McDonald control their color with their secret beef tallow/oil ratio)? Since it was cooked in animal fat, it's very hard to control the temperature. Animal fat burns at a much lower temp and has a much shorter usage/mileage than non-animal fat.  The result of this is a darker brown color.  It doesn't taste burnt, but it has that look.    
I didn't taste any of the duck fat attributes in fries until I got out of the restaurant. This is because when animal fat cools, the taste is more pronounced.  (i.e. toast with butter has more butter taste than melted butter on pancakes.)  Perhaps the they need to control the ratio between duck and veggie oil. 

Burger:  I tried to order just the burger (Village Burger) (med rare)  to see what the highlight of the burger is.  Although the meat has a great grind and it was very juicy. It lacked alot of  beef flavor.  Perhaps the type of beef was not right or it didn't have enough beef fat.  Some of my restauranteur friends often admit they add alittle bit of beef tallow or mix other types of beef cuts in their burger meat to add flavor and texture.   The thousand island dressing added a different dimension to the taste of the burger.   The pickle is great!  The last time I tasted such great brine on a pickle was when I was in Frankfurt, Germany during a spring pickle festival.  

Overall, my meal costs $27 + tips.  Service was great, but I thought I would get more out of my $11 burger. I think if I do ever go back, I would try to put toppings on my burger.  Given the appetizer was very good, I would expect the toppings would make the burger better.   But then would you want to rely on toppings to make your burger better?",2011-04-29 01:48:43,

My friends tried to change my mind, and as I have more and more experience with good pizza, I can see the appeal, but was never too impressed. 
But my oh my, Capofitto totally blew me away. I was just searching for a brunch place to catch up with a friend and this popped up. Gelato and pizza sounds interesting, so we decided on this one, 
You walk in and the gelato is in the front, it's very cute, and continuing in the back is the restaurant. The lighting is dim, especially compared to the gelato parlor which has huge windows. It's very cozy and comfortable. 
We decided on a San Lorenzo pizza to share and got the bread pudding for dessert (it's a bit too cold today for gelato). Both items were to share. The pizza crust is thin with the perfect spread of toppings. I have a huge appetite, but even half of the pizza was incredibly filling. It looked so thin too. I prefer savory foods over sweets, but the bread pudding was really good. It was warm and dense. The bread is not overly sweet, and has a relatively strong egg taste (that I really like and enjoy). The syrup drizzled over top enhances the bread, and with the spice and baked apple slices, the perfect autumn dessert. 
In my journey to find ""good"" pizza, to understand the obsession over it, I've tried a lot. I have been on the road to conversion and I am completely converted now.As I was eating, I was already planning a return trip.

Finding a coffee shop that caters as much to the non-coffee drinkers can be a challenge.  I was expecting to go elsewhere on this hot Sunday afternoon, but it was closed for the holiday weekend.  Yelp helped me find Red Hook.  Like another reviewer, I noticed that the staff was sitting chatting with friends when I walked in, but she stood right up to assist me.  She offered her recommendation for an Earl Grey with Caramel Latte.  It was a great choice.  Good flavor... and something I never would've considered on my own.

My one (maybe two) issues with Red Hook is that the place feels a bit like visiting a college kid's shared house.  The mismatched furniture is cute, but worn and dirty.  There was dust and dirt everywhere.  And, probably due to the heat outside and frequent door openings, lots of bugs.  They also didn't have air conditioning.

Finally at 845 I called inside and requested to be served. So, finally someone came outside to help us with water and get us wine glasses. So our first experience was not that good. 
The only reason why this place gets 3 stars os because the food was very good and tasty. The place is also byob with no corkage fees. They give free chips n salsa. Salsa was descent too. Although our chips took 45 mins to arrive and came with our apps instead of upfront. For food we ordered their friend banana with beef and chicken with saffrin rice for entrees.

My fiance loves ice cream cake, so for his birthday, I ordered an ice cream cake to be delivered literally next door.. like 8 feet away, and it didn't happen.

I spoke with the owner earlier in the week and he was super friendly and eager to have a cake made and was the one to suggest that it could be delivered since I mentioned he worked right next door. I asked if I could pay over the phone so I didn't have to make a separate trip to the store, but was told they would incur fees if they did that and that I should come in person, even if it was after the time of delivery. It was a bit annoying to have to make a separate trip, but I was happy that they seemed to be flexible if I couldn't make it there before today.

I happened to be able to get to the store on Wednesday to place the order and I was there for a quite a while. There was only one person there, and while she was very friendly, she seemed pretty flustered having to deal with placing my order and handling other customers as they came in. She didn't really know much about the cake options and had me speak to their manager on her cell phone to answer my questions. Really, not a big deal, but I had assumed that employees would know the basics about how many servings were in a cake, what flavors we could do, etc. While expensive ($35) I went for the ""regular"" size. Once we finally established the order, the cash registers all temporarily crashed and were denying people's cards. We finally got it ordered and paid for and again, a delivery time of 12:15 was confirmed. His name was taken and my phone number was taken in case there were any issues. I specified what time it had to be delivered because it is when my fiance is on his break and would have to go back into a classroom to teach and the cake would just turn into a melty mess if it had to sit there. 

When I hadn't heard from him, I called the store to see if it had been delivered. I called three times in about 20 minutes and no one answered the phone, so I called my fiance and while not wanting to ruin the surprise, had to ask if it had arrived- it hadn't. One of his co-workers went next door to check on it and it was still sitting there. The person working eventually ended up calling me and saying that she couldn't leave the store since she was the only one there, but that someone came and picked it up (after I called him and told him to check on it). On top of it, I'm told that it didn't even taste very good. 


**As an edit to my original review: As soon as the owner found out that there was a problem, he called to try and right the situation in any way possible. He didn't try to make excuses for why it happened, but apologized that we had a negative experience with the store. Through the whole process, he has been very friendly and professional and I appreciate him reaching out to see what they could do to fix it.  I understand these things do happen occasionally and it says a lot when a business owner actively takes steps to make the situation better.  Like I said originally, the yogurt is good and I appreciate the efforts, so I will be giving them another chance.",2013-09-06 18:03:31,"{'food': ['yogurt'], 'drink': []}"

They have an awesome beer selection with plenty of new options all the time. And I'm not sure if this is a regular happy hour special, but sometimes all of their draft beers are $4. Which is a steal, considering the selection.  I got to try Clown Shoes Muffin Top-- Belgian strong ale, 10% abv, really how could you resist trying based on that name!  $4!  and it was delicious!

Their food has also been consistently good. I'm in love with their beer brined pork loin sandwich!

Service is always very friendly, prompt and efficient. The waitresses can make recommends and always with a smile.  There was one time that our servers had a mix-up and neither was coming over because they both thought the other had our table. After about 20 minutes of sitting there and waiting, we went to the bar to get our own drinks, and finally flagged a waitress down and asked to order food.  She took our order, and then after talking with the other waitress, both of them came over separately to personally and very sincerely apologize about the mix-up.  They also offered us desserts or a round of drinks on the house to make up for it.  Mistakes happen but it's how they are handled that make the difference!  And the service here is fantastic.

Coffee was fairly average, but there was a waiter who solely refilled coffee so it was always hot and fresh. Cream was at every table, both local and fresh.

I couldn't decide what to order so I ordered a little of everything, Honey's Platter. The pancakes were fairly good, but were kicked up a few notches with their delicious maple syrup and homemade blueberry preserves. The egg they have here are BIG and with ordering them over-easy, the yolk proved to be savory. Not a big bacon fan, but my waiter insisted I try the Lancaster bacon as its local; very mild taste with heaping notes of cedar. Lastly I got the potato latke. This isn't your standard latke, but more like a slice of potato cake. It was creative, fun, and most of all delicious. 

My friend got the Challah Fresh Toast. She was nice enough to let me try it. It was perfectly done, if not too chewy. The Challah they use is fairly dense, so it didn't surprise me. The drawback to using this type of challah for French toast is that the inside doesn't get toasted completely. Not bad, just not what I prefer!

The place was a lot smaller than I imagined, but I loved the ambiance of the bar/restaurant- small booths and high top tables, the subway tile, the old school looking bar. 

Our server was very friendly and started us right away with plenty of water. It was amazingly hot that day, so we both passed on drinks. We had taken a look at the menu while at the game, and we were intrigued by their pickle menu. Our server suggested the turnips and kale, and we decided to go with that. The mason jar full of pickled turnips and kale, served with creamy ricotta and olive tapenade was just what we needed, since we didn't have a big meal during the game (and we were pretty hungry). The ricotta spread was creamy, and though I am not a huge fan of olives (i avoid them usually) the tapenade was soooooo good- briny and just enough olive, but smooth without being too overpowering. 

My friend got the veggie burger, and I got a regular burger and we split an order of their duck fat fries. The burgers came out promptly and I loved that mine was this perfectly shaped patty, cooked to order, and I loved the thousand island dressing as the condiment. My friend's massive veggie burger looked good too- it was topped with tons of avocado. The fries were soooo good too- crisp and salty, thick and substantial, without being too greasy. We ate the last crumb!

Our bill was reasonable, considering we didn't have any alcohol- 35 bucks. I definitely will return on a future trip to Philly, perhaps for fancy drinks.",2011-04-24 23:40:57,"{'food': ['turnips', 'kale', 'veggie burger', 'regular burger'], 'drink': []}"

Whomever was the hostess was completely overwhelmed.  The person I was with and I waited at least 20 minutes just to put our name in and during that time, I counted 22 open seats (which compromise almost half of the seats in the restaurant).  She kept looking at her seating chart and the swelling number of people waiting to put their name in and it seems that she just shut down and wouldn't talk to anyone.  They really need to either train her better or find someone who can handle the job.  When we finally got to her, we asked if we could sit at the counter (6 open seats) and sat there with no additional wait.  We overheard other people waiting saying that they had been waiting an hour to get seated.  It would have been trivially easy (less than 5 minutes) for the hostess to take everyone's name and party size and seat those waiting first at the empty tables (judging by the amount of ice that had melted in the water glasses, quite a few of the empty tables were open for a while).

On the plus side, the food is really good, but not worth an hour wait.  Also, the food is *very* expensive - $4 for a small glass of orange juice doesn't help.  For two people, the bill came to $38, and that was for 1 glass of OJ, 1 glass of chocolate milk, 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of  toast, 4 pieces of bacon and the Huevos Rancheros.  Also, Honey's only takes cash, so bring a boat load of it.

I'm giving it 5 stars for good food and good service, then subtracting 2 for the long wait to put our name in and the prices.

As an aside, and this has nothing to do with Honey's, is that people need to lose their sense that they are entitled to everything.  While we were waiting to put our name in,  2 women started arguing that they needed to be seated (they were 4 adults and 2 small squirmy children).  It turns out that they actually had a table outside (which is very difficult to get because there are so few of them), then refused to sit outside because at another table there was 2 small dogs sitting under the table. who weren't bothering anyone.

As usual I'll start with service.

Attentive, engaging and efficient, but some work to do. Enough said?

What makes a restaurant is the menu. Agreed?

For starters, we ordered the broccoli rabe and the eggplant capanata.  It's unusual to describe both in the same way, yet the words ""tender"" and ""flavorful"" come to mind. As we were consumed them, we had to stop at one point and ask ""are we leaving room for dinner?"" That's how good they were.

As for dinner, we were served papperdelle noodles with sausage and bolognese and seafood fraDiavolo. So, I should start with how we finished. Taking half of the dishes home. The portions are huge, and by no means a reflections on flavor. It was true italian in every sense. Might I add my girlfriend is Sicilian (a bit of an expert on the matter). So knowing Italian cuisine, I would say LaScala hits the mark from a taste perspective.

Where a little coaching is needed is in the service area. The server was immature in his approach and presentation. His knowledge of the menu was limited and did not present the best of what LaScala has to offer. It was not bad, by any means, just lacking in enthusiasm.

One certain annoyance is the televisions in the bar area. I believe a restaurant should be exclusive to food, service and atmosphere. Hearing the silly World Series game announcers was simply not a welcomed audible. Why would you have this?

If you venture downtown Philadelphia, especially the Olde City area, I think LaScala is worth the try. 

I'll finish telling you we took half our entree's home (huge portions). We gleefully heated them up the next day for lunch and dug in. Smiles ensued.

My friends and I managed to get seats at the bar, so we just ordered food and beer at the bar instead of waiting 2 hours for a table.
The atmosphere is trendy - The bar area is very long and spacious, but it eventually got really crowded through the evening. I noticed there were maybe only 15-20 dining tables towards the back of the restaurant - goodluck getting seated at a table!

Honey Whiskey Wings - The sauce was sweet, but that's pretty much it. There was no depth in flavor, cant really taste any whiskey in the sauce - nothing too special in my opinion. 
Mussels in Manhattan Clam Chowder - yummy!! i wanted to soak every last drop of the chowder with bread. The mussels also had good flavor.
Disco Fries - I really wanted to like this dish. Handcut fries with peas, ham, chucky cheese sauce and top with a perfectly poached egg. It sounded and looked amazing, but i found the fries too soggy & really greasy. The sauce was bland. It definitely sounded better than it tasted.
Green Beans in almond butter -this side dish was surprisingly wonderful. Probably my favorite dish of the night. The beans were perfectly cooked. Crunchy and seasoned well. The butter sauce was dreamy and I love the touch of almond. Every ingredient in the dish made sense and worked great together.

The whiskey is $3-4 more per glass compared to other area whiskey bars (Bourbon Branch) for the same brand and style of whiskey.

I had the roasted carrots with ricotta appetizer. The carrots were perfect. The ricotta was very sweet and lacking flavor. I was not impressed by the dish as a whole and it was expensive for what I liked on the plate - roasted carrots.

Had the salad with chickpeas - it was a good, simple salad, no complaints at all.

We shared the charcuterie board because the bartender recommended it saying all meats were made in-house, very cool. Get this if you really really love pate because it comes with two rather large servings of pate and two more very tiny servings of other meat and a basket of toasted bread. I like pate but was not expecting such a large portion of pate and such small portions of other meats.

I thought this exemplified the care and appreciation that Happy Joy has for their customer base. More restaurants could really learn and do the same!

The portion sizes were large and both sandwiches were served with a generous amount of meat (unlike Subway/Blimpie, etc.).

I expected their typical menu, but be warned that even at 2 pm on Saturday, you'll order from the brunch menu.

We felt as though the kitchen and bar were a little disorganized--we ended up getting our food before our beers. The place was absolutely packed, and service wasn't too fast nor attentive. Our food was kind of cool when it came to the table, as though it had been sitting at the pass for a while before it came to our table.

But let's talk about the actual food! We ordered the chicken & waffles and the cheese ""hold the beef"" burger. Both were excellent. The chicken could have used a bit more spice, (I would seriously place KFC's mix of eleven secret herbs and spices above Jones') but the gravy was amazing. We ended up dipping ERRYTHANG in that gravy. The waffle was Belgian-style, chewy on the inside and nicely crispy on the outside.

For those of you who have never been to ANY Moroccan restaurants, lemme break this shiz down for you.  So you show up and they seat you at a big round table, low to the ground, with nice cushy pillows on your seats.  The meal is broken into 7 parts, all of which are eaten with your hands or using pita (with the exception of the couscous).  First is cold dips- hummus (at some places, not all), baba ghanoush, marinated carrots, and cucumber salad.  The second is something called a bastilla, which is a phyllo dough stuffed with egg, chicken and nuts, and covered in powdered sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Courses three and four are meat courses- can be kabobs, roast chicken, lamb, (or veggie options, for you plant-eating folks).  The fifth course is couscous.  The sixth course is fresh fruit.  And the final seventh course is baklava and mint tea.  Sound good?  Damn right it sounds good.  And if you are lucky, you will be treated with a belly dancing show.  Ooh la la.

For those people who have already popped their bastilla cherry, I can tell you that Marrakesh is a pretty standard Moroccan joint but definitely my favorite in the city.  I really like that it is multiple levels, so each table feels very cozy and private.  One downfall of the multiple levels is that when the belly dancer comes out, you can only see her if she's in your section (unlike Casablanca in NE Philly that is more open AND has a male dancer, but that's for another review).  And its location right off South Street gives you easy access to continue the party after dinner. 

Food wise, Marrakesh is definitely the better of the Moroccan places in Philly.  Marrakesh does not have hummus in their first course, however the baba ghanoush more than makes up for that.  On our last visit, we got the spicy chicken and the lamb with almonds.  Both were delicious- the chicken had a nice kick to it and was super juicy.  The lamb was both savory and sweet at the same time.   Yum!

Marrakesh is best visited with a group- great place for a double or triple date.  Or a girls night out.  Make sure to bring booze, as this spot is BYOB.  And also make sure to bring some cash, because they don't take credit.  And make sure to do some sit-ups if you want to challenge the dancer to a belly dance-off.",2012-10-11 19:06:31,"{'food': ['cold dips', 'bastilla', 'meat courses', 'couscous', 'fresh fruit', 'baklava'], 'drink': []}"

Like many other Yelpers, I first discovered Mood Cafe while wandering down Baltimore Ave looking at Yelp, and seeing the 5 star rating, I knew I had to try it. When I walked in and told Hassan I wanted a specific dish (from the large blackboard filled with goodies) he made sure I knew what Chaat was (I did not), then explained (he always explains it as a mixture of sweet, spicy, all these flavors together. Which seems to open up more questions than answers, but I do not complain). The combination was incredible. I spent the next few days dreaming of returning again. And I did again, and again. Delicious, yes. But it is so affordable that it can actually be a regular hangout ($6.99 for veg chaat!). 

One piece of advice, don't bother going for the meat Chaat. They are equally good, but more expensive and take longer. And I am generally partial to meat myself.",2013-10-26 21:12:13,"{'food': ['Chaat'], 'drink': []}"

Before I even walked in, I was greeted by an awesome sign pointing out the business. It's a simple neon red sign that tersely states ""BAR."" I like it a lot. Once inside, I was loving the atmosphere. The bar is really great, as you can kind of see in this picture. It runs the length of the room, but also has a few peninsulas. The result is that you can sit at the bar and be across from whoever you are with, which is a great feature.

As far as beer goes, PT does not disappoint. There are about ten beers on draft. Further, the choices represent a well thought out variety of brews. PT also supplies a nice bottle list as a supplement. I had the Dogfish Head Aprihop and Brooklyn Brewery Blunderbuss and enjoyed both beers.

I can seriously recommend to anyone to go to Prohibition Taproom for one reason: deep-fried green beans. This phenomenal appetizer is a great way to start your meal and comes with a nice aioli. The rest of the food was average. Between Lana, J.Mal, and myself, we ordered two burgers and a grilled cheese, and these three dishes were fine, nothing more. I was happy to be full, but the main dishes are the lowest point of the experience.

Friday night this place got a little crazy, with a crowd from art museum area and plenty of ""bros."" Don't make this your Friday or Saturday night hangout spot.

Bottom Line: I like this new place. It has good atmosphere, beer, and one excellent appetizer. Prohibition Taproom has made it onto my list of bars to regularly visit. The biggest downside are the hours. No lunch, no brunch, and the bar opens at 4pm.",2009-03-05 16:05:51,

The food is very affordable, the cocktails can really add up though. It's definitely a one or two drinks with dinner type of place.

The restaurant's atmosphere is great, it's got a modern retro diner feel with a fire place in the middle, very cool looking exposed stone as walls and the mural behind the bar of the 50s women playing with red balloons is awesome. Pretty much everything fits the theme from the chairs to the lights. I also like that the waiters and waitresses wear jeans and tshirts, I know I love my job more because I can go to work in jeans and a tshirt. 

Now as for brunch - I had a gift card and my boyfriend and I wanted brunch, I love Jones so I figured yesterday would be the perfect opportunity to try the brunch, take my boyfriend there who has never been and get a free or very cheap meal. We walked in around 2:15 (brunch lasts til 3) and were sat promptly. The restaurant was busy so maybe coming towards the end allowed us an immediate seat because the restaurant cleared out around 3. 

I got the BMW pancakes which were buttermilk pancakes with carmelized bananas and walnuts and maple syrup. Wasn't a fan of the bananas, but the pancakes were delicious. They give you way too much though, do people complain about getting too much food? haha.  It's literally three plate size pancakes that could easily fill two people. Definitely a good dish to share. The coffee is strong, the orange juice is fresh and the bloody marys are made to order (I got the classic jones mary with ketel one and olives stuffed with blue cheese - they get more interesting though - you can get jumbo shrimp, old bay on the rim, and countless other things.) 

The only negative is that the waitress got my order wrong because apparently she misheard me so instead of BMW pancakes I originally got Potato pancakes. My dish had to get sent back while my boyfriends got a little cold sitting there because he was being polite.

First, the breakfast buffet is ridiculously expensive - 16 dollars for continental and a whole 35 dollars if you want anything hot. The food was good, but not 35 bucks for breakfast good! Walk to City Tap House for brunch instead. 

The other criticism is an unfortunate circumstance rather than anything the hotel is doing wrong, but it still affects the experience - the street/block the hotel is on does not smell good.

The only complaint I have is that the tables were extremely close together. I'm talking sharing salt and pepper with the table next to us, tight.

Service was fantastic: knowledgeable, unobtrusive, well paced and on top of the details (like reminding me to take the Sauternes off ice while we were eating our mains, so it wouldn't be too cold for dessert).  $92/person (counting a good-sized tip).

I'm not sure if the whole disinterested hipster vibe translates well to service - our waiters were present, if a little robotic. They would stop by to ask if the food was ""delicous,"" then slide away before we had a chance to really answer.

The miso ramen was surprisingly tasty, though the broth was a little thinner than I'm used to. The meat was fall-apart tender, the soft-cooked egg was perfect, and the noodles were chewy, if a little underdone with a few clumps where the noodles had stuck together.

The curried egg and rice dumplings were not my favorite. They were somewhat lacking in flavor - to me, they tasted like some yellow rice wrapped in thick dumpling skins. The wings were a good balance of sweet and salty, though I would have liked a little more sauce. Some of the pieces had barely any sauce and ended up tasting like fried chicken.

The teas were pretty good, though the hot ginger-honey tea tasted suspiciously similar to the ginger crystal tea mix I buy at Chinese supermarkets.

All in all, I like that Cheu experiments with different flavors, using Asian cuisine as a springboard for creativity rather than a box within which all dishes must be contained.

     I've tried various entrees and have found most of them to be hit-and-miss.  The pizza is okay, but I suspect they use canned mushrooms.  I once drunkenly called them to inquire as such, but they vehemently denied anything but fresh mushrooms.  I think they were lying.
     However, I love their calzone.  It's so sinful.  I always get the mushroom and onion and a large not only feeds me for three days, but seems to get better with time.  I have a tendency to order at campusfood.com (how I love not having to explain myself on the phone), but I've found that they often have more dessert options, etc. than listed, which they can tell you about if you call.   I've found them remarkably accomodating when calling- that is, when they pick up the phone.  For some reason, as of late, their hours have not been as advertised.  I've called in late afternoon and the phone just rings and rings.  Campusfood sometimes randomly lists them as closed, even though their listed hours suggest otherwise.  However, last time my fiance called, the person there was kind enough to field questions for twenty minutes and make suggestions.  Maybe he spit in our food later, but the fiance LOVED the salad.  It was possibly the biggest salad I've ever seen.
    Speed of delivery obviously depends on when you're ordering, but lately, it's pretty speedy.  I find the prices mostly reasonable.

The cafe is located on the corner lot, so it had lots of windows on the front and the side, bringing in bright natural light.

Right at the entrance, they had some bread and baked goods, such as croissant, apple turnover, and raisin roll. On the side, they had lots of sweets such as macarons, tartlet, and éclairs.

Upon reading the menu I realized that they seemed to have changed things up a bit.  They lowered their charge for the house chips and salsa ($1 a person now) and the salsa choices are a bit more flavorful.  The chip seasoning can still be a little overwhelming though.

Now, considering my friend is Greek, taking her to a Greek restaurant is like taking Jacque Cousteau to an aquarium, but I made an reservation and away we went. 

We decided to traverse the menu tapas style, and ordered many appetizers instead of entrees. We started with the fried smelts (a special of the night), octopus with peppers, onions, and capers and saganaki (pan fried sheep's cheese). The smelts were smaller than I have seen served before and we were presented with a sizable pile accompanied by a simple salad of tomato and cucumber. Crispy and well seasoned, I could have just kept eating these all night! The octopus was cooked perfectly (not a chewy bit in sight) and the saganaki was GORGEOUS. Served with olives and figs in a small amount of brine, we found ourselves using our bread to get every last bite! (Side note: Homemade sourdough bread with tahini sauce kicked off our meal. YUM!) 

Our second ""course"" consisted of the Koukouvagia which was a salad composed of Cretan rusks (sorta like olive oil soaked croutons), feta cheese, olives, tomatoes, oregano and mixed greens. Again a very sizable portion, which we easily split. Fresh ingredients all nicely paired in flavor and texture.

And then the last two dishes... sweetbreads (another special) and a rabbit casserole. Seeing as I had never tried sweetbreads( the thymus or pancreas gland of lamb or veal. These were veal.) we took a chance and ordered them and I'm glad we did! They were served to us encased in a deep fried batter, we received 5 of them and they were deliciously moist and tender. This dish was by far my friend's favorite as it took her back to Greece. And as for the rabbit stew, what can I say? Served in a small terracotta pot, the rabbit itself was flaky and gamey and the giant white beans were the perfect partner. 

At the end of the meal, we were so stuffed, we wouldn't fit in dessert. For all those plates our total came to $50.75, a great bargain in my opinion for such caliper of food. 

Also worth mentioning... the staff and owner were friendly and knowledgeable and we enjoyed the decor. It is fairly small, so on a packed night (like ours) it was quite noisy.

My boyfriend was in town, and we did all the touristy things around the city. He looked through the guide book I had, and was looking at the restaurants in the area, and we happen to be on South St.. I was new to Philly so didnt know any of the restaurants, we came here because of the great blurb in the book, we get to the restaurant and see all there zagat awards on the front, and are thinking this is great, we are going to have some great Italian food. 

NOT the case. We go in, the place was empty besides one other table that was finishing up.  We may have gone at an odd time, really late lunch most likely. The waiter was nice, I want to say a bit slow for us being the only table their. Boyfriend ordered spaghetti and meatballs, I tasted some, that had to be the worst pasta sauce ever, and the pasta was overcooked. I don't remember what I had exactly, it was a chicken dish, again not good at all, chicken had no flavor, the sauce was strange. What really bothered me was the pasta sauce, the stuff you get from the jars tastes a million times better than what we were served. 

Obviously we had not read the yelp reviews before eating here, but looking through them I see really high reviews and really low ones (which echo my experience at the restaurant). My boyfriend has a theory that the true cooks were locked away somewhere unable to cook any good food that is the restaurants claim to fame. I have no desire to return to this restaurant and find out otherwise, and i would not dream of suggesting this place to anyone, I would suggest they go to Olive Garden before coming here or making their own pasta and adding some jarred pasta sauce, either would be a better food experience.",2010-10-09 02:26:17,"{'food': ['spaghetti and meatballs', 'chicken dish'], 'drink': []}"

Overall, the food was good, the beer selection was great, but I have a few issues. First, it is hard to find from the outside unless you've been there before. It is set back a bit from the street, and the signage is very subtle. It's not in a place where you'd expect to find a bar like this, attached to an upscale condominium. This is perhaps a cause of my only real complaint: there was only a handful of people inside. It was certainly not a lively place, and we were there at seven on a Saturday night. 

The service was terrific, as would be expected with a sparse crowd. The bartender was great, proving his knowledge in both beer and sports. No complaints whatsoever about the staff. We sat at the bar, talked sports and watched the World Baseball Classic on one of their big flat screen televisions. 

An interesting tidbit with regard to the name: in colonial times (and still today in the UK), a tied house was a public house that was required to buy at least some of its beer from a particular brewery, unlike free houses. Indeed, this pub is ""tied"" to the General Lafayette Inn & Brewery, although they have a wide selection of beers from elsewhere. This is in my opinion their greatest strength; besides having a full bar, they sport a wide selection of great craft beers. I tried a pair of General Lafayette brews: the Sunset Red Ale(a smooth amber ale) and Chocolate Thunder(a nice porter), and both were terrific. 

To conclude, the tied house is a great place to go for some decent food and a great beer, but you may be left wanting with regard to ambiance and company.",2009-03-08 02:23:44,"{'food': ['food'], 'drink': ['beer']}"

It's a bummer because I enjoyed the Hai Street in Center City and I was beyond excited at the expansion of fast(ish) food options in University City. 

I always get the Gozilla version, which is supposedly a ""monster size"" for whatever sushi-burrito you choose because the regular sizes are not filling (and I'm a fairly petite person). Basically I believe they're meant to double the meat for the Gozilla, and at other locations, it makes a decent sizable difference. However, the several times that I've visited this location, EACH time I feel like my Gozilla ""monster size"" sushirritos are absolutely no different from regular, which are small to begin with (probably less than two or three inches in diameter). I've tried the Gozilla with the Hai Street Chicken, the Slammin' Salmon, and Chili Citrus Pork, and I'm not going back because it wasn't worth it each time. I think the main problem is that I can see them just eyeballing the sushirrito, because sometimes they look at it and then add or take away a strip of meat, so I feel like there aren't any consistent standards and you're left at the discretion of the servers, who don't seem particularly friendly.

We were able to sit upstairs in an empty dining room (which felt a bit strange) but was not a huge deal.

Once our table was ready, we were shocked to see how small this place actually is. You are literally rubbing elbows, backs, heads and everything else with your fellow patrons. In my opinion, it was a major interference with our overall dining experience. Our table was up against a wall on one side and then another two top was sat to our other side.

I was definitely still very hungry so I sampled what was leftover from appetizers, my friends general tso wings, which were okay. Tasty, but nothing special.

I'm hard pressed to think of a time that I've ordered gnocci and not needed a to-go box. I knew immediately I was still going to be hungry. The flavor, however, was very good.

My friend was equally unsatisfied with his duck sandwich. It was about  half a sandwich size and did not come with anything on the side. For dinner you would expect a sandwich to have something, anything on the side. I felt bad for him and offered some of my gnocci, which we joked about. We both left still hungry and after paying we decided that we had to hit another spot on the way home in order to get some satisfying food.

It's on the pricier side, but I'm always completely satisfied when I leave.

We were looking for things to do and came across the idea of checking out some food trucks since we don't have access to any where we are. We checked some out on Yelp but found that many closed at 3 or 4 and it was already 4:30 by the time we were about to leave. I found Cucina Zapata, loved the idea of Thai-Mexican fusion, saw the reviews and decided that the hour long drive was worth it to try this place. So we had high hopes..

We got to Philly, parked at some obscure bank, and while waiting for our food, sneaked around Drexel. oops! The guy taking our order was SO nice. He asked us if we'd been there before and when we said no we were from Jersey and we came all the way to try this place, his face lightened up and he welcomed us all so friendly and warmly. 

For the actual food.. I got the chicken satay tacos and my friend got the captain crunch tilapia burrito. I gave the review 4 stars because the food wasn't anything MINDBLOWING like another Yelp reviewer noted. However, I did love the concept of the food and think it was well executed. I personally liked the Tilapia burrito better than the chicken satay tacos -i just think it had more flavor and texture. 

What I liked about the food: the flavor of the chicken satay in the tacos -the very bold, curry flavor; the crunchy texture and all the spiciness from the sriracha in the tilapia burrito (i think he may have forgotten to put sriracha in the chicken tacos). What I think could have been done better with the food: the tacos and the burrito, aside from the fusion between thai and mexican flavors, seemed like any other tacos/burritos with red cabbage, avocado, lettuce, although the house sauce and sriracha did kick it up a notch. maybe they could have added some complementary spices, pickled the veggies, or something to give it that wow factor. That having been said...

Overall experience:
Friendliness of staff: 5 stars
Concept of food: 5 stars

Pros
- Costumer service is top notch
- 24 hour room service, which is surprisingly good.  Plus they deliver wines by the glass or bottle.  And they tell you your order will take 30-40 minutes, which is totally tolerable, but every time I ordered I had my food in less than 20 minutes.  I'm talking breakfast, dinner, and dessert.  No idea how they do it, but damn Loews, you're winning me over
- Safe
- Convenient location (especially if you are going to Thomas Jefferson).  There are tons of restaurants featuring different cuisine within 4 blocks and many of them give you the option of take out
- Awesome gym.  Not only is it huge, but it has large windows that enabled me to stalk people in the Marriott across the street. Makes my feeble attempt at a workout so much better
- Cucumber-lemon water in the lobby and gym (naturally detoxifying!)  
- Amazing bath products.  The conditioner is off the chain and thick enough to use as a shave cream if needed (you're welcome)
- Super duper comfy bed
- Free wi-fi
- They'll hold your bags at Customer Service for as long as you want
- Nice lounge, with outlets everywhere

Cons
- Housekeeping could be a little better, but overall the room was clean, spacious, and very comfortable
- I stayed in room 923 in a Deluxe King room.  Per the website it says that 
Deluxe King rooms face ""either downtown Philadelphia or Delaware River.""  Yes my room did face downtown Philadelphia as in office buildings and other hotels.  However, it was not a big deal as I was only in my room to eat and sleep

When I heard the ownership had changed, I jumped to test it out.  Who was Jay?  Did I care what his favorite sushi bar was?  The first night I was pleasantly surprised.   I ordered again two nights later.  It tasted better.  Tonight was my sixth order over the past few weeks, and I sit at my computer with the taste of the sea lingering on my palate.  The seaweed salad was fine, as was the soup, but it is with the quality of the fish, the deft touch of the gentlemen behind the bar and its incredible value that make this a five star restaurant.  The sashimi platter brought ruby-fleshed tuna, at perfect temperature, along side yellowtail snapper so rich I felt like I had my tongue in a vat of butter.  Albacore, or white tuna, at its worst takes like salt and a piece of turkey that's five days past its prime.  At its best, its pure flavor, creamy and savory with a touch of umami, can elevate the tongue through the stratosphere.  At Jay's Favorite, it is fish in its prime.  As is the salmon.  It tastes so fresh, I feel like I could be eating on some boat in Alaska where it was caught minutes before.  It may be farmed.  I don't know.  It tastes fantastic, though.  There is crab stick on the plate as well.  I happen to like this, though I have never seen it before on a sashimi plate.  The yellowtail roll I ordered was well made.  The rice was very good; and again, the fish was as delicate as a young flower, certainly feeling the savory sting of the chopped scallions but able to hold her own, creating perfect harmony within the walls of seaweed.  I rounded out my order with with 2 pieces of wasabi tobiko sushi. (I had ordered mackerel nigiri in the past, the fish demonstrating the perfect ratio of vinegary tang and oils.)  The wasabi tobiko was the weak point of the night owning to its surprising lack of horseradish bite.  When I eat a heap of wasabi tobiko, I want my nose to run and my brain to release a surge of endorphins because it is so hot.  I didn't feel any of that.   Still, the meal as whole is easily 5-star worthy.  I would pay Chestnut street prices for sushi this good.  Yet I don't have to, as Jay also knows his value.  There are a ton of special rolls on the menu, yet I have not indulged.  Alas, I wrestle with a full-sized spare tire, the only redeeming feature of which is it draws attention away from my several chins.

Things started out well: the hostess told us it would be an hour wait, but we got a table within half an hour.  Unfortunately it went downhill from there.  

We ordered the mussels with white wine and lemon. When it arrived after a long wait, the sauce was delicious, but the mussels themselves were a little dried out, like they had been sitting for a while. 

After another looong interval, our entrees finally arrived.  My medium rare burger was medium well at best, which was a huge disappointment, particularly at this place, which seemed like they'd take pride in their burgers!  There was some red juice on the plate, so maybe it was initially medium rare and just sat under the warmer for too long? The fries and pickle were yummy, as were my friend's pulled pork sandwich and fish and chips with mashie peas.  

When I asked the server where my side of brussels sprouts was, he replied, ""Oh, the sides have all been coming out way after the entrees.""  Um.  If you realize that's happening, maybe someone should fix it.  When they arrived halfway through the meal. they were delicious and steaming hot.  He also never brought me the side of mayo I asked for to go on my burger.

Our server gave excellent descriptions of the food that made it sound far better than it actually was.  We stood awkwardly in the cramped doorway for 20 minutes past our reservation time and ended up not being able to make the movie we had been planning to see afterwards, but we had a lovely stroll around the neighborhood and worked off a few of the calories.  

We started with the fois gras soup and lobster roll.  Both were tasty.  The soup was rich, creamy, spicy, with nice Thai flavors, however, I love liver and there was not even a hint of fois flavor in the bowl.  The lobster roll was refreshing and reminded me of summer on a cold winter evening.  

Our next course was charred octopus and clams with smoked buccatini.  The pasta dish was the best dish of the night - the sauce was spicy and and smoky and the pasta was cooked perfectly - but the clams were overwhelmed by the sauce and the dish would have been more successful with a different protein. The seasoning on the octopus was very tasty, but the dish would have benefited from more pickles. We each enjoyed one paper thin slice of carrot and radish. 

For the main course, we tried the fried Cornish hen and the lamb rigatoni. The pasta was pretty tasty. It came with dollops of smoked ricotta.  It was very comforting and rich food and not bad, if not particularly interesting flavor wise.  The chicken dish was by far the worst of the night.  It was so salty it was barely edible.  I am not one to send food back, but I came close.  It was awful.  It also came with like two pieces of cauliflower and and couple of pieces of homemade paneer that made no sense on the plate.  The whole time I was forcing it down, I dreaming of Federal Donuts chicken and wishing I was there instead.   

Lastly, I had the dirt pudding and my husband had a caramel cake with coffee ice cream.  The ice cream was delicious.  I liked my pudding, but the ""homemade gummy worms"" were super sour.  The coffee was superb.

I like strong flavors and lots of spice, so I enjoyed the heavy-handedness with the seasoning for the most part (except for the salt on the hen).  The portions were quite small overall, but we were full because there were four very rich courses.  I love meat as much as anyone, but I also like vegetables quite a bit and felt they were used too sparingly.  We're talking carrots not gold leaf, so why not give people a few?

As a result we spent more time hearing about the host's family then we did talking with each other.

Hot dog is a fun and affordable food that we both like to make at home. We'd usually bring out all the gourmet sauces and nicknacks to dress it up, so when I read that Hot Diggity has 10 different kinds of gourmet dogs and 12 different sauces for fries to dip in I was instantly sold.

Upon entering the place, you'll see three long community bench with holes in them to put their french fry cones in and high stools surrounding them. Instead of menu, they have hot dog drawings describing the looks and ingredients in the dogs in detail. I've seen those style of hot dogs drawings from Serious Eats before and it turned out it IS from the blog's Hawk Krall. After much discussion, we decided on having the Saigon Fusion, the Seattle Grunge and the Fiesta Dog. The guy behind the counter offered to cut them all in half for us so we can try all of them which we DO! In addition to the dogs we also got a regular size french fries cone, a small curry mayo and a rosemary aioli dipping sauce. 

Saigon Fusion was essentially a banh mi with a hot dog in the middle. All the ingredients were pretty on point and it tasted pretty good. Seattle Grunge was more like a traditional hot dog but with cream cheese. I wouldn't think cream cheese would go well with hot dogs but apparently it did, the combination really complimented the meat flavor and it stood out. Fiesta dog was like a taco, I like the guacamole, sour cream and salsa fresca combination, I wouldn't be mad if they put a little cilantro on it and the fresh lime slice accompanied was a nice touch. 

The fries here are a bit on the thick, softer side. While I enjoy the curry mayo immensely, the rosemary aioli is a bit subtle, suitable for more sophisticated palettes. 

There's a slight awkwardness to the place. I don't enjoy the holes on the bench where small things like the dipping sauces could potentially fall through, and the stool and bench are too close together. If the place become popular and packed, you might not be able to get out. I also can't decide if the bread is stale. The bite of the bread is a bit hard and not in the crusty crispy way. If the bread is delivered in the morning, does it mean that the dogs won't be as good at night? The flavor of the dogs are also not distinct enough to compete with the dressings. Having that said, they're still good.

The dogs were around $5 - $7 each, the fries were like $4. Getting 3 dogs, an order of fries, 2 dipping sauce and 2 sodas were altogether about $25 in total. We'll definitely be back for more. I think it'd be the perfect stop for a light snack on South Street and there are still many more things to try and they are going to have beer soon.

I have been here a few times both pre and post Eli Collins, and I have to say its still just as good as its always been. They make one of the best bloody marys in the city as well as an always delicious burger. It may have changed a bit, but its still awesome. We took a few friends here to celebrate their engagement recently, and everything really worked out nicely.

We started with a few cocktails, classic mule made with rye for me, and we settled in to a steady conversation of wedding planning and stories of engagement nights. The cocktail was delicious, even with the change from standard vodka in a moscow mule to the rye. The ginger beer and lime combo is bomb.

So many things on the menu caught my eye, but the one we all seemed enticed by was the whiskey and sage bread with ramp butter. We ordered one for the table and I ordered the pulled pork shoulder sandwich. The bread came out warm and covered in a flour ""pabbit"" the mascot of Pub and Kitchen. It was served on a slate dish with a smear of ramp butter that was deeply satisfying. I could have eaten the entire loaf all by myself. The butter was superb and you could definitely taste the whiskey in the bread.

I was a little bit disappointed when my pulled pork sandwich came out though. When I think of pulled pork, I think BBQ style. Had the sandwich description read porchetta or something of that nature, I would have expected what I got. That being saidm the sandwich was really tasty, an ode to the Philly staple of roast italian pork. It was super messy, I am talking juice running down your arms while you are chomping down messy, but in such a good way. I devoured the entire thing. So tasty. The fries are just as I remembered them, fantastic. They were super crispy.

We even ordered a dessert to share for the table. It was one for the ages, one of the most delicious panna cottas I have ever had. It was a vanilla cardamom panna cotta covered in a mango sauce. It was the most perfectly textured panna cotta I have ever seen. It had just the right amount of jiggle, so that it quivered in its dish when it was set down on the table. The cardamom was just powerful enough to really bring another level of flavor to it, but not overpower the vanilla in any way. Outstanding. Pub and Kitchen is just as good as its ever been.

This place is def a great for those looking for meat alternatives but def wouldn't say it's healthy as it appears and it isn't for me but would try a salad here maybe instead or one of the portabella burgers.

Updated review: while I'm not a fan of the burgers they serve still they have delicious excellent soups, the shakes they have are natural and devouring, and banana ice cream for the win!

I visited this restaurant with a friend the last time we were in Philadelphia.  We had done some site seeing in the morning and my friend overdid herself and spent most of the afternoon and early afternoon asleep in bed trying to recover from the pain in her hips.  She finally felt well enough to go across the street to eat.  This was in spite of the pain she was suffering when walking.  Due to the pain, my friend was unable to walk well (I had advised her to get a wheelchair), but it was a short walk.  We went into this restaurant and found a table.  My friend carefully raised her leg onto the adjacent seat to ease her pain.  Someone came over, apparently a manager, and asked her to get her leg off the stool.  My friend explained that she needed to keep her leg up because of the pain and he left without a word.  Our waitress came over and we ordered a glass of wine each and were preparing to order food when the waitress said that she could not serve us because my friend had been drinking.  We had not been drinking, but my friend and I have seen others not served alcohol in restaurants and we knew it was useless to argue, so we left.

I came here this past Tuesday with my boyfriend and we ordered grape leaves, the beef shawarma platter (subbing baba ganouj for hummus), the falafel sandwich, and a tropical smoothie. 

What's good:
-The grape leaves! I'm normally not into grape leaves at all, but ordered them because my SO wanted them. I'm not even sure what exactly was in them (other than rice), but they were amazing. They had a really complex mix of flavor: a bit sour, a bit umami, a bit sweet, which made them really interesting. They also came on a bed of salad, so the entire side was really refreshing.
-The beef shawarma platter: tender, flavorful slices of beef with tzatziki sauce, fluffy and fragrant jasmine rice, creamy baba ghanoj, and a really fresh mix of veggies and feta for the salad. 
-The tropical smoothie: coconut, pineapple, banana, and honey. I find smoothies a bit too sweet generally, but this was perfect. *Even better because you get bits of coconut pieces as you sip! 

What's less good:
-The falafel sandwich: The falafel was crispy and I believe homemade, but bland. I wish it had a bit more flavor, and also that there was more hummus in the sandwich.
-The pita: not bad, just not great (thin, kind of tough). I don't think their pita is homemade, so that's probably why.

FOOD: I happen to be a boneless, white meat chicken fan, which is what Wishbone does best. Their dark meat and wings are not as stellar, but still serviceable. Where Wishbone really shines is in their sandwiches, sides and desserts. The southern chicken sandwich with house made pickles and tomato jam is really tasty.

Tonight, a small line was already forming before the 5 pm opening time. 

Simple concept - choose your chicken (classic or special) & choose between white tenders or boneless thighs. Cost is $8.95/lb so pick and choose what you want and move on to the sauces. 6 sauces to choose from (chipotle lime mayo, Thai red curry peanut, green goddess ranch, pommery honey mustard, modern BBQ, and pimenton aioli). Choose your drink and dessert if you want and you're on your way upstairs to the dining area or out the door to shovel it in in the privacy of your own place. 

We went with 3 pieces of each of the chicken (classic tenders, classic boneless thighs, special tenders and special boneless thighs). Total was a little more than a pound and was just over $11. The batter was pretty light for the classic and a little bit more thick and interesting for the special. Not overbearing and definitely able to be enjoyed in its own. Both the tenders and boneless thighs were plenty juicy and flavorful and all in all well-cooked. Personally, I liked the classic better than the special but I still think it's worth trying and figuring out what you like. 4/5 for chicken. 

Sauces: went with 3 that caught my eye - Thai red curry peanut, chipotle lime mayo, and green goddess ranch. I'd say my favorite was the green goddess ranch but I'm always a fan of ranch and fried chicken. A really close second was the chipotle lime mayo. Really can appreciate the chipotle and lime flavors and it's really well-balanced. Wasn't a huge fan of the Thai red curry peanut. I got a lot more peanut than Thai red curry. And with the other options just being so good, I didn't find myself going back to the peanut. 4/5

Apple and pumpkin pies - Wow. Both just were excellent. Flaky, crispy crusts, and neither were too sweet. Personally I was a little shocked that I came here for their fried chicken and felt their dessert outshined the fried chicken. 5/5

Snap juice & tea Co. (Fresh lime, agave, cayenne) - delish. Didn't really get much of the heat from the cayenne but I definitely liked it a lot. Fresh, crisp, bright, just really good with the heaviness of the fried chicken, dipping sauces and fried pies. 5/5

Also they have 6 different fountain drink offerings with no high fructose corn syrup - cane sugar is the sweetener. Orange mango was my favorite and watermelon was a close second. There is a cola, birch beer, a berry flavored one and a diet cola. Also they have Cheerwine for those of you Carolinians who know what that's all about. 

Really a great start. Hopefully they don't run out of chicken and have to close early consistently. 

Will definitely be back. 

And hopefully in future there will be some side options. The meal can certainly feel a little unbalanced/heavy without some vegetables. Maybe at least a pickle or something would do.

I have time to buy some newspapers, magazines, and come back.  Wait, wait.  The only ones with any urgency and me and my colleague.  4:20pm -- train's at Track 5.  Now it's 4:25pm -- gotta go -- train's here.  Finally, the first order appears and then mine.

And I ask one question is there plastic ware - knife, fork -- in the bag?  Oh yes the woman says authoritatively , , , , dash to the train.  No knife.

The Buddha's tofu was sub-par.  It tasted exactly like something you'd get a cheap Chinese restaurant in a rural town.  It was a mound of vegetables and tofu, but nothing tasted fresh and the sauce was bland and bad.

The thing they were famous for when they first started was the ability to have so many different types of salads to choose from and yet have the audacity to offer a ""create your own"" option as well. I still love that idea because some days you don't feel like thinking, you just want to select something that requires no brain work, lol. And other days you want to be wild and free with how you mix your combination of deliciousness, lol.

I'll be honest, I only go to Saladworks for salads. I've  never had one of their sandwiches and the few times I used to get soup it was too salty for my liking.

My favorite Saladworks salads are Sophie's salad, Nicoise, and Mandarin Chicken (which I get minus the mandarin oranges because I can't eat too much citrus). Trust me it tastes just as great when you substitute with apples or even throw in another savory item. The Nicoise  (pronounced ""nee-swah"") was my go to salad when I was seeking to lose weight a few years ago. I called it my miracle lunch. Lastly, Sophie's salad makes me leap for joy - absolutely love the mix of flavors!

Here is my list of other top favorites:

Extras: Throw some black olives on your salad, it adds a great kick and they're great for your health.

Toppings: Hands down the glazed pecans make for the most amazing salad experience!!

Cheese: Cheddar, bleu, and feta are my ""go to"" cheeses.

Dressing: If there's egg in the salad I usually  have thousand island or French dressing. Otherwise, oriental sesame is scrumptious and raspberry vinaigrette is a fruity pick me up - it makes the salad fun to eat!

The food was very fresh and seasonal items were highlighted in the menu. We bought a ""can"" of wine to split between the two of us which was unique and different. The quality of that too was very good. However the menu was limited for vegetarians though the restaurant really tried to accommodate. I had the kale risotto which was very filling. My date (who is also vegetarian) had a tofu steak. Th tofu steak was very well done, of good consistency, and had barbecue sauce. I wasn't a fan of the barbecue sauce because it think it could be better nightlights with an Asian or Mexican style Barbeque sauce. We also had the torched broccoli and crudités platter and rolls with chive butter for appetizers. All these were good though I expected the crudités to be pickled and they we're not.

A girl can only take so much.  At first blush, your seemingly endless bowl of chips, (which is only as good as your server can replenish, it appears), smoked tomato salsa, tomatillo salsa and chunk guac is all nice and good - until super sloppy, absent and inattentive service starts to wear on you.

What you get instead is a big gringo burrito that you can't even finish because the whole lot is filled with undercooked overly crunchy rice.  Your supporters (i.e. dining companions) also bear the brunt of your poor choices with a burrito and its contents barely cooked through, and a burger that wasn't cooked to the right temperature.

6wX-E9N2QjSU1pwxhTXnbQ,RdJ7Ykelg8w4y5FTmxjT8g,1UNorskttXSWuEcgzKzXcA,5,8,0,4,"Tucked into a small storefront on Headhouse Square at Second and Lombard, just off of South Street and next to the Artful Dodger, you'll find Xochitl, one of Philly's hottest new restaurants.  Xochitl, pronounched ""so-sheet,"" is named after an ancient Aztec queen, and I can only describe the fare as Latin American fusion.  And it is to-die-for.

I recommend starting your meal with the fresh guacamole made right at your table.   It is the single most delicious guacamole you will ever eat, and you will find yourself scraping the bottom of the bowl in order to get every last scrap of it.  At least that's what I did.  Following the guacamole and chips, I highly recommend the scallops and watermelon ceviche, which is on permanent special.  While the combination of watermelon with shellfish may sound unusual, I guarantee that the thinly sliced scallops placed atop fresh, sweet watermelon and topped with microgreens will be the most unexpected and heavenly flavor combination that you've ever tasted.

Once you've recovered from the mouth-watering appetizers, you will find that the entrees are just as delightful.  All of the varieties of ceviche served at Xochitl are delicious, and I especially liked their ceviche tostadas.  Another scrumptious dish is the poblano pepper stuffed with ground meat and topped with a vanilla walnut sauce.  If you prefer something else, Xochitl's menu is packed with creative concoctions featuring seafood, chicken, goat meat, and other proteins with spicy vegetable combinations.  The entire menu is featured online at www.xochitlphilly.com, except for the specials, so you can even make your decision before you arrive.

If you still have room for dessert after your meal, you will have difficulty choosing just one item from the dessert menu.  I was too stuffed when I went there, so I opted for the Mexican hot chocolate, which was rich, creamy, and had the slightest hint of some sort of pepper.  My boyfriend and I were there for my birthday, and I suppose that I confounded his plans because I ordered hot chocolate instead of a solid dessert, but the waitress was so sweet that she stuck a lit birthday candle onto the hot chocolate's saucer.  If that's not personalized service, I don't know what is!

In addition to the wonderful food, Xochitl also serves a variety of tequilas and other drinks that you will find appealing.  The tequilas are their specialty, and you can order a sampler flight of three from their extensive tequila menu.  You can also order tequila in cucumber shot glasses.  They also have margaritas, Mexican beer, and other alcoholic beverages.  My favorite drink, however, is their slightly sweet hibiscus-infused water.  If you are adventurous, I suggest their spicy beer concoction, which mixes beer with tomato juice and other spices.

Finally, Xochitl's charming atmosphere and decor combines with its menu to make it one of the hippest new restaurants in Philly.  The cozy upstairs features a full bar area and a dining area, complete with the type of candle-lit decor one might imagine is featured in the old grand haciendas of Zorro's days.  If you go downstairs, you'll find another full bar and charming lounge area, where you can order drinks and food, and the entire atmosphere there is reminiscent of being on a starlight veranda.  The walls are a deep blue, the lighting is low, the couches are comfy, and candlelight twinkles off of mirrors all around you.

I highly recommend making reservations if you intend to go for dinner because seating in the dining area is limited, and this place is becoming ever more popular by the minute.

In all, I would say this is one place that  everyone in Philadelphia ought to try.

UPDATE:  I've been here several times now, and I love this place more and more.  Everything I've had is always perfect, so I'm convinced the chef is a genius.  They also often run specials, like 4-course meals for $35.  The most recent special is the Frida Kahlo menu, which will run until the Frida show at the Art Museum closes on May 18, and which features recipes stolen from Frida's own recipe box (and, I'm sure, improved by the chef - it was all amazingly delicious).  Seriously, the chef there has a real knack for creating perfectly balanced dishes with delicate flavors and mind-blowing delectability.  Take, for example, some of his soups, which come with the ingredients in the bowl, and the broth is poured in at the table, with fresh onions and cilantro on the side.  Pure heaven.",2007-06-11 20:43:25,

Don't get me wrong, I still continue to go here despite the ""meh"" food, but the attractiveness of Mumbai Bistro lies nearly entirely in the location and the price (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1).

I am definitely glad that there is place in walking distance from both Jefferson and Pennsylvania hospital that serves ready-made Indian food I can grab on my lunch break. The standard hospital cafeteria fare can grow old quickly, and I often fantasize about a delicious curry when I contemplate grabbing something predictable from the hospital cafe. 

And I suppose it's a smart business strategy to serve Indian food that is palatable to pickier eaters or people who don't normally enjoy spicy cuisine, but for someone like me who loves Indian food for its vibrant and complex flavors, the food served here is a bland facsimile of familiar favorites. The malai kofta and the mixed vegetable curry are probably the best meatless dishes served here, but even those lack the expected richness and texture. The Gobi Malasa tends to be overcooked and mushy and the paneer masala is downright watery. The naan is somewhat soggy and seems like it has been microwaved.

I don't like giving bad reviews, and I want this place to remain in business, but I think there are some very easy fixes they could do to improve the food here, namely not watering down dishes and not using a microwave to heat up naan. I think it is great that they do not use butter or ghee, but I've also made vegan Indian food in my own home that was more flavorful than this, so I don't find the health claims to be a valid excuse for blandness. I think the concept of a cheap vegan & celiac-friendly buffet that is 5$ a pound is a fantastic idea, but I don't think that it should come at the cost of flavor and consistency.

If you work close by and you're really craving some cheap and fast Indian food that meets your dietary restrictions, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to come here, but if you have your choice of Indian restaurants, I'd definitely recommend choosing a different one.",2014-07-31 02:22:29,"{'food': ['Gobi Malasa', 'Mixed Vegetable Curry', 'Naan'], 'drink': []}"

i can think of a few suggestions or things to warn folks about - it's noisy.  tables in the front didn't seem to be as loud, but the back area bounces sound.  and the staff, who were really wonderful, were a bit over whelming.  i know they needed to turn the table, and i didn't exactly feel rushed, but it was intrusive at times.
the good things sooooo out weigh any room for improvement!  the foi gras soup is unlike anything you've ever tasted - a bit sweet, then rich and creamy, then a hint of heat.  omg - even the croutons pop in your mouth with flavor!  meatloaf and potatoes were not like mom's but intensely flavorful with creamy small potatoes.  roasted pork and broccoli rabe - not your philly sandwich and the provolone bread pudding was amazing!  spicy, and dreamy.  the octopus - super spicy...good for my partner but not me.  salmon was simply amazing - curry and crispy skin.   did you know the bread course is actually truffled popovers!?

I went to Cleopatra on a Thursday night with about 9 people for a friend's going away celebration. As soon as I got there the few people who were there before me told me that we had to have a hookah for every two people and that we weren't allowed to share. This seemed odd to me but we shared anyway.

The servers were very inattentive and rude when they did talk to us. We ended up getting 6 hookahs at the $12+tax charge plus $1 each for 2 extra coals. our night ended abruptly when not 15 minutes after getting our extra coals, the hookahs were taken from in front of us. I know my coal was still burning orange and there was still smoke pulling but the man told me they were done. I tried to tell him that we had literally JUST received the extra coals so he decided to shove the top of the hookah in my face saying that it was done, even as I pointed out the fact that it was still burning. After being treated badly all night we decided to leave at this point. We looked at the check and it said $98 without any breakdown of the charges. On top of the hookahs we ordered 2 $2 waters so our check should have been $78, or $83.46 with a 7% sales tax. When we tried to ask if they included tip the man said ""no tip."" I tried to argue against it but my friends ended up paying the extra money so we could just leave as quickly as possible.

The man even complained that we were at the table for a long time but there were empty tables all night.

The exotic locale and precious few hours open make it quite difficult for me to reach, but I had read so much about this enigmatic vehicle that I waited patiently for a chance to escape the laboratory for the express purpose of discovering this fabled cuisine. 

During my first attempt, I arrived at 1:15, which is not such an unreasonable hour of the afternoon. There were approximately 5 falafel seekers ahead of me, but alas, I was told he would not be serving any more customers that day. Bollocks! My plans were foiled, and the mythical falafel had evaded me. 

I anxiously awaited another opportunity to seek this supposed holy grail of middle eastern food. The second time I arrived at 11:30, and was forced to wait interminably. But wait I did, suffering through fathomless prattle from the proprietor, to which I politely smiled and nodded in response. Finally, my toils (and currency) were justly rewarded with a heavy platter of delicious-smelling sustenance. 

- end dramatization - 

It was a lot of food, but also kind of expensive at $10 a platter. As the guy said, you could pay a lot more at a restaurant for food like that. True, but this is a food truck and not a restaurant. The chicken and rice truck in New York is about half the price and twice the deliciousness. 

Most of it tasted good, even really good, but nothing was particularly outstanding except for maybe the grape-and-other-unidentifiable-things-salad, which was very interesting in flavor. Everything else was a little too garlicky even for my taste, and I'm the kind of person who could snort garlic powder. Also, the chicken and falafel were both too burnt, and I generally like a little charred flavor. 

It may be worth noting that my friend politely asked several times if it would be possible to bring another platter back for someone else. He began to babble about a liquor license and something about drinks. I'm not sure if he legitimately doesn't have a firm grasp of the English language, or if he was consciously choosing to ignore her question by rudely changing the subject and feigning incomprehension. 

Was it good? Sure. Was it worth all that time, effort, and money on my part? Maybe not. Still, the falafel nazi is worth trying at least once, as long as it's not too out of the way for you.",2010-11-24 18:02:04,"{'food': ['chicken', 'falafel'], 'drink': []}"
