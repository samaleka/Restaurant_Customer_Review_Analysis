VRAjK-I6cGyoqSM4IQZRgw,vHvqCNGKIDh4JbM29OseEg,DRnvSL_I8MLuTLhl6O4JBQ,1,2,0,0,"We visited Grace & Pat's on a Friday night around 7:30pm, and it was almost completely empty. We thought this was a bad sign, but decided to stay, because we had loved the pizza at their other location (Gennaro's Tomato Pie), and had been wanting to try Grace & Pat's since it opened.

The first annoyance was that it was cash only, with no ATM on site. I know there's a tradition of Italian restaurants in South Philly being cash only, and Gennaro's is cash only, but it's still annoying. Nevertheless, we walked the several blocks to the CVS to get cash, and came back to the restaurant.

Then, we saw the menu (http://media.philly.com/documents/Grace+and+Pat+Menu+In+house.pdf). Soda is $2.50 (no refills), and extra pizza toppings are $3 each (half or whole pie is the same price). Seriously? Not offering refills on a $2.50 soda is so ridiculous and inhospitable, and I've never seen a restaurant charge $3.00 for a topping like mushrooms or red onions. 

We were still being optimistic, however. If the pizza was as good as Gennaro's, it would be worth putting up with some hassle and nickle-and-diming. 

Unfortunately, the pizza was NOTHING like what we had experienced at Gennaro's. The crust wasn't crisp, it was actually tough. We both joked that we were going to need dental work after eating it. Not only was it tough, it tasted like it had been frozen. They also used the bare minimum of sauce and cheese on the pizza (the photo on their Facebook page looks nothing like the pizza that arrived at our table). I got the white pizza, and it was like a flat bread that someone had barely sprinkled cheese on, toasted, and then forgot in the toaster oven until it got tough. My boyfriend got the red pizza and the sauce was cold in some places, and it was also topped with very little cheese. Same tough, frozen-tasting crust. 

Grace and Pat's gets 1 star for the appearance of the restaurant, and the very nice waitstaff. The restaurant is really cute, the music is at a nice volume, and the waitstaff are very pleasant and attentive. 

If they brought over the recipes from Gennaro's this place would get 5 stars, even if they stayed cash only and were stingy with soda refills. If they stay the course with their current menu, this restaurant won't last a year. East Passyunk has too many great, reasonably-priced restaurants, and too much great pizza for anyone to want to make a return visit to Grace & Pat's. I really, really hope the owners take their Yelp reviews to heart, and address the problems with the current menu.",2015-08-31 20:23:06,"{'food': ['pizza'], 'drink': ['soda']}"

His theory is that the best Chinese must come from China town, so it's worth it to get in the car and go grab some take-out.

Tonight we tried Lee How Fook.

It was a disappointment.

Let me keep it simple -

The orange chicken that was designated as ""spicy"" on the menu was not spicy. Not even a little bit. I am sensitive to spice, and was looking for something spicy to clear my sinuses tonight...and this dish did not deliver. On top of that, it wasn't even flavorful.

The won ton soup was bland and the filling could have benefited from some scallions or carrots or something crunchy.

The pan seared dumplings where chewy and falling apart.

The servings were VERY small, especially considering that the prices were much higher than your typical Chinese restaurant.

The szechuan shredded pork was basically absent any pork.

My fiance and I went for lunch and I ordered the soup du jour (seafood chowder) and the seafood paella, a la carte. He ordered mushroom soup and a steak sandwich. We ate a bit of each other's item--everything BUT my paella which he did not touch. I wasn't very hungry and only finished half my soup and a third of my paella. A short while after lunch I felt unwell--nauseous and queasy. This uneasy feeling sat with me for a few hours and I thought I better get some food into my stomach. 

My mistake was finishing the rest of paella from lunch (yes, refrigerated since I returned home). Within three hours of eating I was retching non-stop and continuously and the only thing that came up was the paella--parts and pieces of it clearly identifiable (sorry to be graphic). My vomiting and illness continued for hours until about 2am in the morning when my stomach was empty and I was finally able to fall asleep. I spent the entirety of the next day in recovery with bed rest, yogurt, banana, and porridge as my only meals for the day. 

I regret several things about going to Bistro St. Tropez: 

1. Going and spending good money for unsanitary or ill-prepared food that didn't taste great in the first place. 
2. A whole day of extreme physical sickness and the next day in recovery.
3. Then I regret that I did not feel well enough to visit the doctor to document my illness.

Certainly very accurate description of the coffee beans process, toasting etc. but he is missing a big point: the ultimate product.

I am italian grew up in Italy where espresso probably has longer history than here. Yes we italian are much less cerebral than here in US where you can write book about coffee. We just go to a bar for a good espresso or cappuccino prepared quickly. Here it has become (no judging) a ritual.

Said this I did try the Bodhi's and Spruce Street 's espresso, in both places  the time to wait for a coffee is unbelievable long, price outrageously expensive. Maybe the trendy and very expensive  Stumptown beans are perfect for hand poured coffee but certainly not for espresso I can tell you this much, those beans are way to bitter. 

Bottom line La Colombe offers the best coffee beans for espresso and cappuccino prepared in a short time with no wait as many of my italian friends agree on. All baristas there are top of the line and I am talking not so much about the decoration with the foam (they are very good of course) but the efficiency and fast service they provide no matter how long the line is. 

For what regards the owners of La Colombe I honestly don't care much of what they do with their personal lives as far as they run a good business !!!

In terms of dates form  roasting he is correct , coffee should be consumed within  2 weeks from grounding but with the big sale they have I don't think  that is an issue and even when you buy coffee in Torrefazione in Italy they don't put the date.

One last point if you make homemade espresso you know that coffee machine should keep a little residual of coffee grinds. As a matter of fact when you buy a coffee machine in Italy they always suggest to run for few time to condition the machine.
I hope this was helpful !

(1) The line is always ridiculously long during busy times (lunch hour and after work), and line moves really really really slow. It kind of takes the fun out of it when it takes 20-25 minutes to get to the front of the line. I feel that if they're truly interested in running it like a fast food joint, then the lines should move quicker (open up 2 more cashier spots). And if they can't do that, they should offer people seating and waiters. As someone who has been there probably 20+ times since the opening 5 weeks ago, I can tell you the lines are getting pretty old, pretty fast.
The ""extra"" employee who stands by the door welcoming people can be put to better use. They are supposed to help by explaining the menu to people - but my initial analysis is that this never makes the line moves faster. People still get to the front and spend forever asking the cashier about the dishes. And, no, the menu is not simple or self-explanatory.

(2) For the Rewards program, you have to tell the cashier your phone number every single time you go in. If you read my first point above, you will realize that the cashier area is usually crowded with hungry people impatiently waiting to order, and basically leaning in listening to what you're saying to said casher. This is a small restaurant to begin with. Therefore, I always feel uncomfortable saying my number to the cashier, who invariably cannot hear, and has to repeat loudly - usually several times over -- while multiple patrons have now tuned in. There MUST be a better way, c'mon now.

I decided to try El Camino Real on a Tuesday night since it's impossible to get a table on a weekend (see my review of Bar Ferdinand). 

Walking in last night ECR immediately endeared itself to me.  Cibo Matto was playing! Throughout the whole night there was a super fun mix of 80's and 90's music. It was great. Of course it's neither Mexican or Texan, but great nonetheless.  We are in Philly, after all.  I even got the pleasure of watching a server dance like M.C. Hammer. 

The food was delicious.  The pig wings are a stellar idea. Their blue cheese is super strong. The pig wings aren't spicy at all, just wonderfully cooked. My friend and I ordered the brisket sandwich and the short rib sandwich.  We both joked about how the kitchen seemed to throw whatever toppings they felt like on the sandwiches.  The sandwiches are huge, thanks in part to the thick sliced toast. None of the sauces were very hot, but the fries are super spicy. I eventually gave up trying to eat them. 

The place has a great selection of drinks and food.  It's really hard to decide what to order if it's your first time there. The service was decent, if a little slow towards the end.  

The reason I really want to under-rate ECR is how our leftovers were handled. My friend and I both asked to have our food wrapped up.  We each had half of a sandwich, a plate full of fries, and sauce. So the server packs it up, puts it in a plastic bag and places it all next to my friend.  Now, I think I need to state two things.  One, I was in the bathroom when my friend asked to have the food packed up so I don't really know if something was said and misunderstood. Two, my friend is male and I am female (and super pretty! just kidding). But you can imagine my surprise when we get back to my place and attempt to divvy up the food. 

They use the foil containers that fold over a cardboard top. So they aren't super easy to open and close. The first container is our sauces in two plastic containers. Weird, and annoying since it's a waste of packaging.  The second container was only fries.  Both of our fries, combined! The third container was the top piece of bread to each of our sandwiches.  And finally, the fourth was the bottoms to our sandwiches. I'm not sure why our server decided to combine our meals in so intimate a way.  Maybe he assumed we were a couple and heading to the same place?  Even so, that's pretty brazen, and totally out of the norm. 

The place is so popular on Yelp, I really wanted to love it. But in the end, I was just weirded out by their packaging of the leftovers.  Weird.",2009-03-18 15:20:03,"{'food': ['pig wings', 'brisket sandwich', 'short rib sandwich', 'fries'], 'drink': []}"

It's actually really refreshing to drink on a very hot day. Mango lassi is very good also, once again with just the right sweetness and enough mango flavour. This time I ordered Kashmiri chaat and asked mine to be medium spicy. I love eating chaat during the summer months because it's refreshing and kind of helps my appetite when you don't want to eat anything. Just in case you don't know, chaat is one of the favourite Indian street food with all kinds of possible combination of veggies, crunchy Indian snacks, fruits, sauces, and yoghurt. The potential of combination seems endless. 

Mood Cafe is rather small for an eat in. They do have limited chairs and tables. I chose to do a take out (which most times seems more convenient). The service is really friendly and pretty efficient. I think they over made their mango lassi they gave me the extra portion in a small cup! If you are new to this area of West Philly you can choose to eat in, or take your food and drink over to Clark Park and have a picnic!",2018-06-20 18:46:32,"{'food': ['lassi', 'chaat'], 'drink': ['mango lassi']}"

All other past experiences here have always been great -- the food was delicious and the perfect amount of spice & kick, the griddle meats were fried to the perfect amount of juiciness and crunch, and the cumin dishes were just mouthwateringly fantastic... but tonight, such fond food memories are gone.

Pros:
-- Unusually quick service... normally there would be a ~15 minute wait time for our food to arrive, but tonight it was out to our table within 5 minutes of us placing our order (not sure if the speediness contributed to the lack of flavor in our dishes)
-- Rice here is really good. They steam it with the right amount of water to produce perfect, white fluffy rice grains.
-- They have a new menu that has a lot of pictures (great for individuals new to Szechuan cuisine) 

Cons:
-- Cumin Chicken had no flavor, whatsoever (the onions had more flavor than the chicken)
-- Boiled Beef was way more oily than I last remembered it. I remember the dish being more soup base with chili oil as a flavoring agent and/or enhancer. This time around, it seemed the beef and cabbage were just sitting in a bowl of chili oil and no soup broth.
-- They have lowered the standard spice level they once cooked at...

If this is the new quality standard Red Kings 2 cooks at, I am greatly saddened. My housemates and I loved coming here for warming food during bitter, cold nights.

He makes my order and the avocado he puts in was very brown and he only gives me 2 pieces. I was really pissed off because #1 who serves someone brown avocado and #2 HE WAS THE MANAGER!

I immediately complained and told him I wanted something new instead. I got the tandoori chicken sandwich as a replacement. To top things off, when I go to the register to pay, the guy accidentally added $0.09 to my credit card as a tip.

Sbraga was a great place for this ""party of one"" to belly up to the Chef's Counter for the $49, four-course prix fixe menu. The atmosphere is dark, contemporary, and lovely. Great for a nice date, a pre-theater meal, small groups, or post-theater drinks (if space is open at the bar).

First Course- Foie Gras Soup (with Rose Petal Relish) Wow! So many things going on here, this soup was amazing. Very rich and delicious. FYI, watching the chef's crank out what looked like a delicious Beet Tartar, after Beet Tartar, this was a hard choice to make, but I'm glad I did.

Second- Grilled Salmon, sprouts and Vadouvan. I live in a ""Vadouvan"" down by the river! My excellent server for the night (she was always on point) described Vadouvan  as an Indian curry-like set of spices. This was a good dish!

Third- Meatloaf, Charcoal Potatoes, scallion and Romesco. Lovely presentation, this one got big ups in Yelp reviews, but I just think it didn't live up to the hype. It didn't wow me, it was just okay.

Dessert- Dirt Pudding with homemade Gummy Worms. Since I was basically overlooking the dessert station of the Chef's Counter, I saw a lot of desserts go out. I actually almost ordered off menu after I saw a dish of what looked like three scoops o f berry sorbet on a bed of Pop Rocks go out (off menu).

We decided to check it out for dinner last night and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. The decor is great, very nice well thought out. Except the tables. for some reason, the tables are awkwardly close to booth seats, which is odd. I ordered the short rib ravioli in red sauce and the wife had this burger baked in dough. Now her burger and fries were great! But that's not what this place is based on, burgers. My ravioli were completely submerged in sauce, and you couldn't tell where the ravioli were without digging through a pile of sauce. When I did finally make my way to the ravioli, the shells were very chewy and the short rib filling was barely existent. I did manage to try som eof the filling that fell out of the ravioli, and it was just a small ball of mushy meat. I will say the sauce was very good, but the amount of sauce to ravioli made me feel as if I was bobbing for ravioli. Our server was VERY good and attentive, which is a plus. The big negative with the serice was the restaurant was super dead (I think one other table) and there were maybe 5 servers on staff. Normaly that wouldn't be a big deal, but our table was right by where the servers input their orders and they decided to huddle up right next to our table and complain about money and not being paid enough. You know, the age old argument ""service workers should receive a salary instead of just tips"".

I broke that promise to myself a few weeks ago because the last time we were there, because the grilled octopus and potato pizza were so good that I thought I could deal with some mediocre service.  But when we went, not only was the service abysmal but the food was bad too.  Not even mediocre--bad.  

The grilled octopus was burnt, not grilled, and was COLD not room temperature by the time it got to us.  It was beyond chewy, it verged on tooth breaking.  The pizza, which I thought no one could really mess up, was just plain not good.  Instead of slices of potato, there was chunks of potato.  Like they were taken from the same pile that they use for mashed potatoes.  

And the service.  We sat outside and it took a LONG time for someone to help us.  In fact, we had to flag down a bus girl to ask if we could get menus.

But then there are drawbacks.  Portions are just too small for many things.  French onion in a cup not much bigger than a shot glass, give me a break.  Lounge and the restaurant are too intertwined, maybe this is the special appeal, but it got just too loud for too long at one point of time.  Wine list is plainly strange, its priced exponentially and they ran out of Haut-Medoc by the time we got seated :-(. 

The biggest drawback in my opinion was the waiting staff.  For one they did not know the menu 100% percent, second they did not pay attention to the table, leaving scores of dirty glasses and dishes on table as more stuff arrived (there were six of us), and while there we have seen too many trays dropped around the restaurant.  

Last draw was a glass of water falling on top of wine glasses sitting atop our table.  We could be easily reseated to a table right next to us as we were done eating and were waiting for some coffee before calling it quits.  But the staff had a slow and not so efficient process of clearing the glass shards from all around and missing some right on the table.

Think of this like any major sports bar but on steroids and louder. The beer menu is extensive and they have a full service bar.  The food menu is replete with all the usual favorites but they also have a large selection of oysters, lobster and crab.  Almost like this place is trying to be Philly, Maryland and Maine all on one.    We tried the recommended CRAB FRIES. We received a  heaping basket of fries covered in Lowrys season salt like stuff with two cheese dipping sides.  It was enough to feed 6 but it was nothing to write home about nor would I recommend unless you have low blood pressure and are trying to pump it up...SALTY!  Also, there is nothing crabby about them.  Don't let the name fool you. No crab meat, no crab flavor. Just a big ole basket of fries. 
We ordered the Italian pizza which was a cheese pizza with arugula and balsamic sauce.  It came with a very thin crust.  Perfect and yummy.  Big enough for two.  The service was average but enough.

Kyhber Pass Pub, is an authentic Cajun Gastropub founded in 1970. It's one of Philadelphia's oldest bars and the menu features a satisfying selection of craft beers, hickory-smoked barbecue, authentic New Orleans specialties and more. 

My best friend and I ordered the small size of the ""Nachos"" which consisted of fresh corn tortilla chips, jack cheese, green tomato salsa, scallions and sour cream. My mouth is literally watering right now as I remember the burst of flavor this appetizer packed. All of the ingredients were fresh which enhanced the flavor. They were simple nachos and I think that's what allowed the flavors to really stand out. Most nachos are usually piled with heaps of cheese, sour cream, meats, etc. With so much food everything gets lost and some ingredients mask each other, but every ingredient in this dish was tasted and savored. 

Entrees 

My friend ordered from the Hickory Smoked Barbecue section of the menu. All entrees there are served with 3 bbq sauces: Kansas City (ketchup based), No. Carolina (vinegar based) and So. Carolina (mustard based). He ordered the ""Sampler"" which allows you to choose two or three meats and two sides for only $17. He picked pork ribs and pulled pork as his meats and chose collard greens and mac and cheese as his sides. 

I opted for the ""North Carolina-style BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich"" topped with spicy vinegar barbecue sauce and coleslaw which was $10. It came with one side so I also chose mac n cheese and added a side of collard greens for $4. I can honestly say that I never felt such a rush of emotions from biting into a sandwich. My friend and I pretty much ate in silence. We were so amazed by the food that when there was a second or two that food was not in our mouths we were too breath-taken to talk anyway. We just looked at each other with big bright eyes and exchanged nods of approval. I was impressed with the culinary skill and the passion that went into making this food. Not only that, but the service was above and beyond. My friend and I never had an empty water glass or empty dishes on the table; our waitress was there taking care of our every need. 

I have to admit that I will be taking another trip down to Philly solely for Khyber Pass Pub. I have never had nachos and collard greens so good anywhere else so I am sure those two will be repeat dishes.",2014-09-28 16:45:13,"{'food': ['Nachos', 'Sampler', 'North Carolina-style BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich', 'Mac and Cheese', 'Collard Greens'], 'drink': []}"

It works well as both a bar and a restaurant.  It's not exactly my scene as a bar, so I've only come here to eat earlier when it's less crowded, but I can see some people really liking this place.  Like Nicole pointed out, this place has a young crowd, read ""college"".  Whether or not this place is crowded depends a lot on the night and the time of the semester, which tells you something: I live around the corner and walk by frequently.  Once Penn ended it went from super lively to very low-key.

The music they play has a pop / R&B feel to it, it's fairly mainstream stuff but within that it's seemed to be music that I tend to like a little more--slightly deeper, mellower vibe but still fairly energetic, which is congruous with the dark but somewhat colorful decor.

Food?  Good burgers, reasonably priced.  Convenient setup allowing you to choose your burger and style (toppings) separately, chicken, turkey, and veggie options alongside the normal beef.  I like the one with guacamole best.  Fries have the skin on which is good.

Don't get me wrong, I love Asian food... love, love, LOVE it. But Korean was always down towards the bottom of my list of things that are yummy. Until this place. For real. I am now converted to the church of Korean flavors. Here's the story.

So I'm feeling terrible one night, really really terrible. I've got a stuffed up nose, I'm super hungry, I'm bloated and its that girly time of the month. And the only thing I want in the whole wide world is just a nice big bowl of warm spicy soup. So I go onto Yelp, and I check out my bookmarks for saved places in my hood. I speed-read a few reviews for this place and convince my husband we need to go here ASAP. 

And like Audrey Horne, I get what I want.

I ordered the mushroom soft tofu (beo seot soon du bu) and my husband ordered spicy chicken & vegetable (dak gal bi). Both medium spice and both so freaking amazing. My soup is spicy, it's comforting, its downright perfect. It was exactly what I was looking for.

But before your food is ready, they bring out 5 different banchan: Kimchi, marinated bean sprouts, spicy cucumber slices, adzuki beans, burdock and jalapenos (I think) marinated in sesame oil and soy sauce? Not sure, but they were all tasty. But the best part is they bring you some weirdly awesome hot tea that I can't get enough of. I haven't figured out if it's Boricha (barley tea) or Hyeonmicha (rice tea). So weird and soooo good.

Preventing a few faux pas:
1) That egg they give you is raw, and it's meant to go in your soup.
2) The weird little box attached to your table? That's a call button for the staff.
3) Don't be dumb. That soup is boiling in there, so DON'T touch the caldron-bowl. Use the plate underneath.
4) Do you mix some of the pitcher of tea with your leftover crispy rice or not? I still haven't figured that one out.
5) This place is totally not for kids. Delicate wall hangings? Boiling hot stoneware? A call button on the table to play with? A raw egg just sitting there, waiting to be used as a weapon? Yeah.

p2SBD6gyw3djvrSh_Daz4Q,f3sNvuXS-Qin_YMNbmoKng,YtSqYv1Q_pOltsVPSx54SA,4,3,1,4,"I'd been to the Prime Rib just once before coming last Sunday for Restaurant Week.  I have done a lot to avoid red meat over the past 8 months or so, although I still eat it on occasion, before this, however, I ate red meat all the time, including all kinds of fine cuts at fancy steakhouses like Morton's and the Capital Grill.  I have been known to enjoy a good piece of beef every now and then, so I came to Prime Rib not remembering the last time I went, and expecting some exquisite dining, even if it was the special Restaurant Week menu...prime rib is prime rib.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:
The Prime Rib is inconspicuously nestled just off Rittenhouse Square, down the street a little from Parc.  Raoul Duke may have actually been describing his first impressions of the Prime Rib when he wrote the place ""fairly reeked of high-grade formica and plastic palm trees.  It was clearly a high-class refuge for big spenders.  This was Bob Hope's turf.  Frank Sinatra's.  Spiro Agnew's.""  I did my best look like anything but a 22 year old with less money in the bank than most of these peoples' weekend allowance.

THE ATMOSPHERE:
There are aspects of the main dining room that work very well, and others that work not so well, but everything is unmistakably Prime Rib, and I remembered being there many years ago almost instantly.  Black and dark wooden furnishings and warm lighting, with a live jazz duet of piano and bass wafted through the air, and really boosted my experience.  But, as others have mentioned, the leopard print carpet and giant fake flower arrangements were unbelievably tacky and basically equalized the atmosphere, which given the clientelle, began to feel reminiscent of some corny seniors night at a banquet hall.  I didn't have any problem with my choice of attire-- a blue striped shirt and a pair of grey slacks, none of us wore a jacket.

THE SERVICE:
Excellent, I would say this was the strongest aspect of the Prime Rib.  Ours was respectful during conversations not to interrupt, very knowledgeable about wine choice and able to give an excellent recommendation, and did not come off as being either condescending or impatient, even if we were opting for the much cheaper 3-course Restaurant Week offering, as opposed to the full-priced regular menu.  Also, while I was originally thinking she was purposefully showing the wine list and not the Restaurant Week menu which featured wine deals because she wanted us to buy a more expensive bottle of wine, I think she saved my table money, as I would have paid more if I drank by the glass.  Soft-spoken, insanely polite and attentive, but a little stuffy, the service is a calibre I wish we saw more often in restaurants today.

THE FOOD/DRINK:
I came to the Prime Rib expecting an exquisite piece of meat that melted in my mouth in an orgy of flavor.  It did not meet my lofty expectations, however...but let me start at the beginning.  I started with their roasted tomato soup, which was delicious, although their pepper mill was grinding the pepper just big enough to get caught in my throat twice, which was unpleasant, but not enough to curb my enjoyment.  I got the prime rib, medium rare, with mashed potatoes and string beans.  I almost never eat anything less-cooked than medium, but I figured for some reason that medium-rare might be the way to go...I should have stuck with medium, but the temperature didn't really affect my enjoyment.  For the most part, it was pretty good, decent marbling and enough flavor (although I was looking for a little more garlic and only found more thickly crushed black pepper).  What did me in, however, is the fact that toward the end, the prime rib tasted something reminiscent of what I identified as ""Bar Mitzvah Brisket,"" which I loathe...not to compare the Prime Rib with that horrid staple at my family's high holiday gatherings, but that did affect my enjoyment of it.  At any rate, the sides, typical steakhouse fare, were very good, but nothing memorable.  To top it off, I had a slice of key lime pie, which was very good, although a little warmer than I'm used to.  I had a bottle of cabernet sauvignon which we split 3 ways, it complimented the meal quite nicely and was priced incredibly-- half price...it is scientifically and statistically impossible to pass that up...unless you're my iron-willed roommate who stuck with water.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
The Prime Rib is pretty well-established as a classy joint generally fared by the old and well-to-do.  It's not the kind of place I'd take a date, however, it's more a family place for some reason (and not babies and kids, mind you, keep your damn kids at home, I mean like grandparent to young teen cousins range).  I had lofty expectations for their specialty, but in the end, I'll prefer a Morton's or Capital Grill steak over Prime Rib.  The service is impeccable, and for a change, added stars to this review, but I don't know if it will be enough to make me want to come back any time soon.",2008-09-18 18:35:40,"{'food': ['roasted tomato soup', 'prime rib', 'mashed potatoes', 'string beans'], 'drink': ['cabernet sauvignon']}"

I live in the neighborhood and when I walk by, I often see Angela herself in the small kitchen through the window on 8th Street.

Angelina's is not inexpensive, but it's an affordable indulgence offering excellent quality (and service) for the price, which isn't true of many restaurants in Center City. My family enjoyed the salad, salmon, eggplant, spaghetti special, and tiramisu. That homemade tiramisu is incredible and generously portioned: one serving is plenty for two people.

They've expanded the dessert pie to include pecan pie and they have some more drink options than opening week too.

We came back and just went with the classic white and dark, pairing them up with the pommery honey mustard and chipotle lime mayo, and I'd have to say I think the honey mustard sauce is my new favorite!

For example the flat bread could have used a little squeeze of citrus. For main courses, I ordered the short rib (served with a potato gordita and roasted veggies) and bf ordered the pollo frito (served with cornbread and greens) at the waiter's recommendation.

Over the years the corned beef has evolved into the current gourmet version which I was disappointed by this past St. Patrick's day but it was still good.

I was on a birthday gift shopping mission and had somehow managed to not also buy me something along the way. Mad stalwart of me, I'd say. So, it occurred to me, as I was in the neighborhood, that yes I should indeed treat myself to a lil something from HipCityVeg; a tasty vegan reward meal was in order.

The space is small and seats were filled up, but with luck and what I like to call some, ""friendly hoverin' "" I was lucky enough to manage to snag a seat by the time that my name was called for my order- quickly, at that! I enjoyed the hell outta the Crispy HipCity Ranch: battered chick'n, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and peppercorn ranch on a soft, wheat burger bun. The chick'n was hot and juicy with coating as absolutely so super crispy as could be. I don't know if I'll ever be able to try anything else on the menu after gettin down with that sandwich. Too good. You got me, sandwich.

Look at me, I'm no longer vegetarian, so I'll take a bite outta a bird, no problem. It's just that there are not so many true chicken sandwiches that I'll spend so much time hankerin for. I have to say, this chick'n was startlingly chickeny. And I've had some chick'n in my day...

I SO badly want to give them at least 4 stars. But the noise level in this place was just way off the charts. Definitely go on a off night, or before the dinner rush.

Appetizer
-Crab & Spinach Dip (w/ crispy pita chips): Wasn't really feelin' this dish. I almost always order a spinach or artichoke dip when I see it on a menu. But this one let me down. Maybe it was just too crabby... which is weird because I'm a Marylander.

Entree
-Pot Roast (w/ roasted veggies & mashed potatoes): First of all, let me just say... those mashed potatoes were to die for. I believe they're homemade too. As for my pot roast, it was very tasty, just could of been a tad more tender. I feel like a good pot roast will pull apart with your fork and just melt in your mouth.
-I was also really tempted by the Meatloaf and Thanksgiving Dinner when I saw others around me eating it.

I had the BEST time last night at Square 1682 for RW festivities!

We had a reservation for 7:30pm for party of 6. My husband and I arrived a few minutes early and were greeted by a sleek hostess immediately and even took our coats. We checked out the bar area downstairs and ordered an ""old fashioned"" from a beautiful bartender who also noticed us right away when we walked in and did not make us wave for her attention. The drink was expensive for us but good. The bar area is small but the decor is modern and yet warm and cozy. There were business people there for happy hour, romantic couples and even a few singles by themselves enjoying a light dinner by the bar and a book. Everyone looked comfortable. The kitchen is at the back of the room and you can see the chefs in there cooking up a storm. Bless them!
One of the bartenders found that I was there for RW and he took at least 5 minutes to go through the entire menu with me and gave me his opinions of his favorites. He recommended the following: Tuna Tostadas, Octopus, Lobster Pot Pie, and others for appetizers. For entrees, he noted how pleasantly surprised he was at the chicken, and also recommended the NY Strip (not a full fillet). I was interested in the seafood entrees and he approved my choice of the grouper.

When our party was ready, we were led upstairs to the dining room. Similar decor but now you get to check out the details of the table setting. It is a small place but after settling into our seats I did not feel cramped at all. It's a great date place. The lighting again was low but warm. There were some interesting flower arrangements at the bar in the back. Our little appetizer/bread plates were really cute, it looked like a big coaster and it in was a print of a studio apt layout! The colors were soft gold with specks of red. Festive and romantic. The girls were giddy.

The service was great. Our waiter was not pushy but informational. I didnt ask for his recommendations though. I should've. 
Run down of the food we ordered:
Apps: Octopus, Lobster Pot Pie, Beet Salad, Regular Salad, Tuna Tostada, Potato Gnocchi. It seems that all were good. I heard the Beet Salad had a fishy taste in part of the sauce and we suspected anchovies but another taster could not find it.
My lobster pot pie had a buttery flaky crust topped with a CLAW! It was such a  cute presentation! The soup was just as indulgent and naughty! Creamy, lobster bisque like with root vegetables that were still crunchy and flavorful. My husband had the Tuna Tostada. It was a good combo of tortilla chip (salty), jalapeno, spicy sauce and raw tuna. There were 3 bites on the plate which was probably not enough for my husband but he shared the pot pie with me. The tuna tostada was good but not as spectacular as the pot pie. I had a taste of the octopus. Very refreshing! It had a tang to it and it was tender and not chewy. It paired well with the fennel. 
For entree I got the ""Pan Seared Grouper with
white sweet potatoes, roasted corn and truffle vinaigrette"" The sweet potatoes were pureed so that it could've been a polenta look alike on the dish. The corn and truffle was served on top of the sweet potatoes with a just right size piece of grouper. I loved the sweet potatoes. It was sweet & savory. The corn and truffle added the saltiness and interesting texture. The fish was good. Nothing too crazy. I felt like the star was the side dish. The presentation was lovely. I really felt like I was on Iron chef.
My husband's NY Strip was cook right and the purple potatoes were fun to eat. He said while it was good, he has had better steaks before. But men can never resist ordering red meats at places if offered.
Everyone finished their entrees. One ordered the bass and one ordered salmon. Another ordered the NY Strip as well and he finished his first. The portions of the entrees were not obnoxiously big or too petite. It was just right for a 3 course meal. Dessert: I looked forward to this the most, but alas, the appetizer was my favorite course. That's because I didnt order the apple fritters!!!!!
Luckily my friend ordered it, it came out looking like fried donut holes! I got a bite and was in love. Fluffy, with sugar, and gooey apple inside. Better than my apple pies out of the oven. My cranberry upside down cake was sort of rustic and dry. The goat cheese ice cream was not kidding! It really tasted like goat cheese. I had half the chocolate orange tart of his and the chocolate was creamy and the tart was ok. I think they wanted the chocolate to stand out more. Not bad. With a couple of drinks per person, our bill came out to about $50 per person. I thought it was a great price for the amount of food and lovely experience. I was really pleased that they didnt automatically add gratuity in there. The waiters had to run up from the kitchen downstairs to deliver our food. They were all breathless to keep the food warm and they were all in good running shape.",2010-01-21 14:07:03,"{'food': ['Octopus', 'Lobster Pot Pie', 'Beet Salad', 'Regular Salad', 'Tuna Tostada', 'Potato Gnocchi'], 'drink': []}"

The first time I came here, it was really good! The staff was nice and the food was really good!

But the last time I came, I went with my boyfriend and I had a bad experience with one of the staff members. We went up to pay with cash and the guy didn't even want to take our order; he asked someone else to. He took one look at us and I could tell he was upset. When he called out our number, we didn't hear him the first time and he got really angry. When we got up there, he was pissed and one of his co-workers said, ""Why are you getting upset over just one ticket?"" 

I really don't want to assume. It could've been anything; maybe it was because we're an interracial couple, maybe it was because my bf is a little older than me, maybe it was because my bf is a dwarf, or maybe he was just having a bad day. Again, I don't want to assume so I'm going to go with a bad day. 

He was mean but the food was still good! :)

foie gras pastrami: interesting but like i said, i like mine seared and dripping with fat. not cold.
Braised Rabbit: excellent
Almond tortellini: unexpected flavor combination but out of this world
roasted goat: very very tender. again very unexpected flavor combonations

there were several fresh made pasta dishes that I lost track of but all were unreal in terms of the quality of ingredients and the freshness of the pasta

I say: 

JUST EAT LESS, YOU HEALTH SEEKERS, AND TO-GO THEM CALORIES HOME!

Overall, this place gets your pho out lightening fast. However, its dishes are generally pricier than other places because they have found health-saavy yet less pho-experienced customers who will eat the advertising up. (That would not be me.)

For several more quarters, you get above-average pho restaurant aesthetic appeal (fancier LOOKING menus, TVs that each play different channels so that Beyonce, gun shots from a horror movie,  and poignant orchestral music for Adopt-A-Puppy commercials will compliment your dining experience). And you get the mental satisfaction that comes from a  ""Health Conscious Food"" motto plastered on their menus. Plus more a more spacious, less hectic, cleaner dining experience.  

But here's the bugger: Pho is already health saavy, and this place does not enlighten the food triangle anymore than Nam Phuong or its store front on 5th St. I will admit that they reduce the amount of starch and carbs... 

...by serving you fewer noodles in your pho and shrinking the size of your Vietnamese crepe...

After a day of training for a new job, my new co-workers and I ventured into the city with a free bottle of wine and free bottle of cider in hopes of finding a nice BYO to imbibe. We were told Kanella could be hit-or-miss, but we decided to give it a try. 

Right off the bat, everything was great. It had just opened so we had no problem getting a table sans-reservation, and the hostess gave us a table that was right by a window, albeit next to the kitchen, that gave us a nice place to people-watch. The decor itself is lovely. The banquets are lined with loose pillows, everything is done in light colors and the big windows really complete the whole comfy, relaxed vibe. Our server (I'm totally blanking on the name) was really nice, funny,  and efficient, despite him coming off as a bit spacey. 

Now, the best part is obviously the food. We shared 4 appetizers and 2 desserts for our meal which definitely left us super full. The dips of the day that we got to try were a garlic-potato, which was pleasantly chunky, a creamy yet somewhat savory lentil spread (my FAVORITE omg), and traditional baba ghanouj. The pita that it was served with was warm and obviously right off the grill. The dolmathes were also great and had an interesting spin in that it was served with raisins, giving it a sweet aspect. I wish it had come with 3 pieces, as opposed to two, but that's just a minor complain. We also had a pastry that had feta cheese and spinach, topped with honey (they even gave that honey thing that is used traditionally...the wooden one? You know? I have no idea what it's called), and it was divine. Our final appetizer was the grilled calamari, which I found delightful for being a bit overdone. Fortunately for us, the chef felt the same way and gave it to us on the house without us even making a comment on it. Finally, the deserts were AWESOME. We got a trio of ice cream which included mint, cardamom, and jasmine. The jasmine wasn't my deal, but the mint was AWESOME. It tasted like actual mint, as opposed to something you would buy out of a carton from Acme. The small pastry tasting I felt was slightly over-priced, but then again they managed to make semolina cake really good so I guess I can't really complain. 

While Kanella isn't the best Greek/Mediterranean food in the city, it's definitely up there. The chef obviously cares about the product that goes out and the staff seems to genuinely enjoy working there. It's great for all occasions, from business lunches to romantic dates.

The first time I ordered they slathered my burger with Mayo which was really upsetting because you are given the option on GrubHub to choose your toppings and I did *NOT* select it. However the quesadilla was SO AMAZING that I had to give them another chance.

The second time I ordered I typed in all caps ""ABSOLUTELY NO MAYO"" and my meal was superb. Their burgers are fresh - no pre-made patties here - and everything is just great right down to the side of fries. (I don't eat coleslaw so I can't speak to if it's any good.)

The *THIRD* time I ordered was a disaster. They forgot my shake, they brought regular coke instead of diet. I was at a party so lots of people had ordered, so we got a free 2 liter. The delivery guy had to leave and come back again and it was really frustrating. GrubHub actually refunded part of my order.

The next time I ordered, I called first and told the manager what had happened previously. He sent out a free 2 liter to replace the OTHER free 2 liter, and this time everything was perfect again.

The LAST time I ordered, the quesadilla was a disaster. They hardly put anything inside of it so it ended up just being mostly tortilla.

So, as you can see, it seems to be a luck of the draw situation. The reality is that it's usually quite good (surly delivery guys almost every time though), and one of the few 24 hour places in West Philly.

*UPDATE* - I have upped my review by a full star. Here's the deal. Things still tend to be hit or miss here, but the hits are so delicious I can deal with the misses. I had another quesadilla disaster, but I had a really solid conversation with the owner and he sincerely wants his customers to know that they are working HARD to make things the way they want them. He also sent out a replacement. You know, in this day and age when a small business owner actually give a damn, it means a lot to me. A LOT. They could send out mistakenly prepared food every time and as long as it wasn't legitimately BAD - which it never really has been - I would remain loyal because I know that they care and they're trying.

Part of it is the texture of the silky sauce on the perfectly-cooked beef but I think what I love most is that they're not stingy with the pineapple and its sweetness counterbalances the meat so well. And a chicken lemongrass soup has replaced matzoh ball as the one I want to eat when I'm not feeling well. Spicy and sweet and touches all the right spots on Your palate.

It's BYO and cash only which keeps the cost down but the portions are so big and the quality so good they could charge me double and I would still pay it.

The family who runs it couldn't be any nicer either. 

Tip: in Spring 2016 they're apparently giving the place a facelift and there will be outdoor dining. 

Another tip: I hear there's going to be a Northern liberties outpost coming soon. Lucky nolibbers!",2016-03-12 03:14:29,"{'food': ['chicken pumpkin dish', 'minced pork', 'steak with pineapple', 'chicken lemongrass soup'], 'drink': []}"

Tuna nachos - awesome.  I've noticed a trend on sushi menu's lately to have spicy tuna on top of some crunchy vessle.  These tuna nachos are spicy tuna on top of avocado goodness on top of (what seemed to be) freshly fried chip.

The tables are covered with ""vintage"" ads from the '80s and '90s -- i can't tell if this is for kitsch factor, or if they just haven't been updated in a LOOOONG time. I suspect the latter. There's also a few arcade games that seem straight out of 1989, and a kinda sketchy crew of hoodlums sprawled out on the booths, paper bag 40s glued to their lips.

I'm pretty laid back when it comes to choosing places to eat, so I decided to find a place to suit my vegetarian friend. HipCityVeg was near the top of the list, conveniently located, and open later than lots of other places. Plus, they boast burgers. Sold.

This cute little shop seats about 18, and focuses mainly on vegetarian burgers/sandwiches or salads. There are also a few sweet items for dessert. The menu is relatively small, but perfect.

I ordered the Ziggy burger which consisted of smoked Tempeh (not too sure what that was..) and special sauce. It also had onions and what I believe was vegetarian bacon. The burger was served on a soft multigrain bun and was cooked perfectly. The tempeh was moist, the bacon added a little saltiness, and the sauce added a nice herbed flavor that made the whole thing harmoniously delicious. I scarfed that thing so fast, but not faster than my veggie friend who barely took a breath to talk to me while eating hers. 

Also: Those sweet potato fries!! How do they make them so well?! They tasted freshly cut, not frozen, fried to perfection, and salted just slightly. They were so simple yet so damn good. I wasn't even hungry anymore and I kept eating them! Ugh. I even talked to the people working there, raving about them. Lame, I know. They're served with a cilantro black-bean dip that I was mistakenly pouring on my burger, thinking that was what it was for. Oops. The dip goes perfectly with the fries; it's creamy, the cilantro adds a subtle fresh, herb flavor, but I couldn't really identify the black bean aspect of the sauce. Overall, great anyway. 

Lastly, I couldn't leave without a sweet treat, and the Five Dollar Shake was calling my name. They come in vanilla, chocolate, and orange creamsicle, but I opted for chocolate. It was a great decision, and I can honestly say, out of all the milkshakes I've have in my life (lots), I've never had one quite like this. I'm fairly certain there was no dairy in it, but rather a base of almond milk, since there was a nuttiness to the flavor. The drink tasted like a blended up chocolate cake, and I doubt there is any other place that hits this kind of flavor profile that HipCityVeg does with this shake. Get it. You will not regret it.

The good things- I was warmly greeted by the hostess when I came in, she checked me in because we had a reservation and I went to the bar to have a drink while I waited for them. The bartender was very nice. As soon as the rest of my party arrived we were seated. Our waitress was very nice, given that it was a bit crazy in there with restaurant week.

I just moved to Manayunk a month ago, and wanted something delivered for the first time here. After reading all the reviews about how great it was, I decided to go with the Falafel platter with a lemonade. It was a bit pricey at 19 and change (not including tip), but I didn't mind the price too much because the rave reviews were in the back of my mind. 

The food took an hour and fifteen minutes to get to my house. I'm willing to give them a pass on that, because 1) they told me it could take up to an hour, and 2) I ordered at 6:30 on a Saturday night. 

The food itself: The hummus was your average hummus, pretty good. The sides of tabouleh and lettuce/onion/tomato were good. The falafel was decent, but a bit too hard for my liking. The pita is where it all went wrong. The pita was not at all fluffy or soft. It was too thin, and almost too tough to bite through. A real disappointment cause they gave me a lot of it. Maybe I'll make some pita chips out of them though... So there was really no point in wrapping the falafel and fix-ins inside the pita because it was too hard to bite into. 

I was soo hungry and it was too expensive to not eat, yet I didn't finish all of it. I'm hoping it'll make for some above-average eats when I come home later tonight after a night at the bars. 

I woulda given it 2, but I ended up giving it 3 stars because 1) maybe I just got one of the rare bad meals, 2) I didn't wanna bring the ratings down too much because people really seem to love this place, 3) they were very nice on the phone, and 4) maybe it's a lot better when you eat there.

La Colombe, in a word, is fabulous. While their cappuccinos do not feature the perfect combination of espresso crema and milk froth to create glorious ""latte art,"" I still gulped a couple of these drinks down during my three random trips to Philadelphia. The espresso was not bitter and the milk was just rightly sweet. I couldn't complain. Their large mug of coffee is great too. 

Relax - coffee snobbery is not all THAT rampant here. The lack of a menu (which tells you that you are only allowed the classics - the way it should be done anyway, frankly) balances out with the OK espresso shots. However, if memory serves me right, the shop uses a La Marzocco to pull its shots (WAY snobby, but in the right way).

My favorite thing about La Colombe, though, is the atmosphere. Large windows are placed opposite a warm dark wood interior, which truly provides a world that is the best of both. People-watching is a definite do here. True characters haunt this place. One time when I went, a scrubby young man, who had just seemingly finished smoking his cigarette outside, came back in with the stub of his cigarette enclosed in his hand and jacket sleeve. Was he trying to create some sort of hot box in his sleeve? Beats me. Weird. 

I haven't even gotten to their cups. They're gorgeous. Cappuccinos are served out of beautiful sets of cornflower blue and maroon Deruta ceramic cups and saucers. From what I hear, they're custom-painted. Some of the tables in the cafe even feature broken pieces of the pattern.

I was kind of intimidated because I wasn't sure really how it worked, but before I even asked for help the owner broke everything down for me and really took the time out to explain how to order. After my first bowl I was hooked! I literally crave it. And even though I come in so often now the owner never fails to be just as friendly as the first day. I can't even lie, my boyfriend and I literally eat poké 3 times a week. We actually have to stop our selves from getting it so often! The business is definitely growing too. Every time we come in there's a subtle change made to help improve the store for example, the punch card that leads to a free bowl, although we always forget ours. I have tasted a change in the fish they use as well, I feel like the already good quality food they used since day one improves every time we go it. From talking to the owner I can tell he really cares about his customers and the food he serves. He is there every single day and he doesn't just stand in the background, he is hands on every time. I have read some of the other reviews posted here and I can tell you for sure anyone who is complaining about customer service must be a really difficult person because I have never had a bad experience, not even once. I also read one where someone said they got ""sick"", out of all of my experiences and my boyfriends and all of the people I have brought or sent there no one else has ever gotten sick. And lastly people complaining about the portions and price, if the portion isn't right for you, then you are over eating! The portion is balanced and if you're used to eating bigger portions you might want to reevaluate your own diet. People are so used to over eating they think that an appropriate portion isn't big enough. As far as pricing goes, maybe you shouldn't eat out if you are complaining that fresh raw fish and the other fresh ingredients are too expensive. It's pricier for a reason people, raw fish that's high quality ain't cheap. If you compare to prices of sushi, it's actually much cheaper. When you go to get sushi one 6pce order of rolls will cost you around the same and be about a third of the amount of food. So in conclusion, go get some poké from a great business with a great staff and amazing food!!!!",2016-07-27 01:56:04,"{'food': ['poké bowl'], 'drink': []}"

My first visit to Ruth's a few days ago was my first and it certainly was not my last.  I already anticipate my next visit - which I hope is soon enough.

I was impressed with the timeliness of service and the arrival of each course to my table.  From the barbequed shrimp to the salad (which was a basic salad, but was one of the best salads I've ever had while eating out), to the stuffed chicken breast, to my sides of asparagus with Hollandaise sauce and mashed potatoes - the food was plated beautifully (we were even warned by our server of how hot the dishes would be when they came out and to be careful not to touch them.  He was right and then some!)

I chose an Italian red to go with the main course and while I should have gotten tipsy by the amount of wine I was served, I didn't so much as feel flushed.  The wine was beyond delicious and complemented my meal beautifully.

And the dessert topped off what was an out of this world meal.  Their crème brulee is the best I've ever had - hands down - and their coffee was so good it failed to make me jittery.  It was the perfect topper.  I was sorry to have that come to an end.

The hostess and wait staff were courteous, friendly, and, above all, professional.  My server, Duran, was an absolute sweetheart.  He and his helpers kept coming to my table, to make sure we liked our meal.  I also saw him do this with his other tables.

I saw how professional and courteous the staff here was upon entering when we were seated sans reservations.  Granted, we arrived shortly after opening for dinner, but other places of this caliber would turn you away or make you wait to be seated.

After my visit, I floated home and went to bed quite satisfied.  I woke up the next morning barely hungry.  That one meal satisfied me for nearly 2 days!

I was treated beautifully by the staff here and I have no reservations about making a return trip here.

Finally, the cost. Way too high. The Paneer Tikka Masala and rice was around $14 I think. Buffet's are usually cheaper but Taj does not have one.

I just wanted to thank you for reviewing this place in the Inquirer and bringing a tsunami of old yuppies and their fancy BYO wines into this restaurant. In the past few weeks since your review, it has become near impossible to get a seat at one of my favorite spots in Philly. Why, just yesterday we walked into a packed restaurant at around 7:45, and our server friend apologetically discouraged us from waiting, telling us that it would be quite a while. He even discouraged us from getting takeout, saying that would probably be awhile as well, and they were out of a lot of things. 

Thanks to you, the secret is out. This is all your fault. In the future, please refrain from reading my Yelp reviews and exposing my secret places. They are reserved for my fellow Yelpers only, not your Inquirer readers.

The restaurant is located in an unusual place: the 4th floor of the Design Center.  The advantage is a great view of the Art Museum and 30th St. Amtrak Station.  The décor is kind of semi-minimalist modern, nothing offensive.

Our waiter was near perfect.  He explained the dishes and specials and when the main courses arrived, he explained the smoldering fragrant vegetation, it was from the chef's property near St. Tropez in France.  Water was promptly refilled but he never hovered or made us feel like he was hovering.

My wife had the Rack of Lamb and it came rare as ordered as was my steak.  She pronounced it heavenly. We shared my dessert which was a flake-pastry with vanilla ice cream and strawberries. Yum!

Yes.. It is worth the hype.

First, Tria is on a perfect quite city corner. It is rather dreamy. They have a few outside tables (with heaters) too! 

It took us a few minutes to get seated, but once we were the service was on point. We didn't have one server, we had two who consistently checked on us. As soon as one of our glasses was coming to an end, one of them would appear and ask if we would like another or if there is anything else they could get for us. Like I said, the service was on absolute point!

To drink, I had the ""Sunday School"" special which was a champagne that was crisp and kept me wanting more. Not just wanting but successfully getting more... 3 glasses later... I also tried the ginger saison. I think I have a new favorite beer! It was fruity but not too much so. I kid you not, I took a picture of the name of it so I can hunt it down and have it again! However, if these aren't your bag, they have endless wine selections and knowledgeable staff to help you find the perfect beverage.

On to the food. Ohhhh the food. Swoon! 

We started with the Warm Poached Black Mission Figs with Gorgonzola and Prosciutto di Parma. They practically melt in your mouth. Another great tip that the server told us was we should add another fig for 40 cents so that we would have an even amount for splitting. Um, ok server from heaven! Its comments like this that made the service so great! 

Do yourself a favor and get the Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey. I think of all the things we had, this was the highlight. The ricotta was light and left us wanting more. I think I could have had 5 or 6 plates of this. Maybe next time I will? 

As for the main course, I ordered the Claudio Mozzarella Sandwich with Crispy Prosciutto, Piquillo Peppers, Pesto and Garlic Vinaigrette, which was good. I think the two appetizers stole the show though. I was also able to try the American Albacore Tuna Sandwich with Black Olive Tapenade, Piquillo Peppers and Arugula. The tuna was delightful with hints of capers and what tasted a bit like anchovies? 

Finally we finished the meal with the Flourless Chocolate Torta with Blackberries, Espresso Custard, Coffee Crumb and Saba. The best part was the custard! It is a small portion so I wouldn't suggest splitting it with more than one person. However, it is the perfect petite dessert for two to share.

If you've made it this far through the review (thanks for reading!) you'll realize that Tria Cafe Wash West is a fantastic establishment and I would highly recommend it to any friends!",2016-04-13 13:44:38,

Apparently, it is just that way after NYE. I would say the food and ambiance were great and the service was good. 

For an appetizer, we had the pepper crusted filet skewers on french fries. They were really tasty, especially with the horseradish sauce. For entrees, my husband had the crispy ginger salmon with a side of risotto and I had the NY strip with a side of mashed potatoes. The salmon was extremely salty whereas the risotto was a little bland. Both were good enough, but I would expect more. My steak was great with the Port-Wine Demi Glace and the mashed potatoes were perfect. 

The reason I am not giving the full five stars is because of the service. Our waitress was very attentive, but I was a bit miffed that she put a gratuity on there for the two of us. I am sure there are some people who do not tip on the pre-discount price, but I was prepared to give her MORE than the amount she charged us. Additionally, the coffee at the end of my meal tasted like it had been there all day. It was TERRIBLE and I am not even that picky of a coffee drinker. Finally, and this is being nitpicky, I hate it when servers pick up the bill before you are ready to leave. They should wait until you are gone to pick up the signed copy of the credit card bill. It wasn't even 7:00 pm when we were done so it was not like the server was trying to leave ASAP.

This place is located in the outskirts of the airport terminals, in what seems to have the local food offerings. You'll also find the Philadelphia Pretzel Factory right across the food court. The Tony Luke's here isn't cheap by any stretch but you'll pay the premium when in need of a Philly fix.

I loved going to the original Tony Luke's before they started popping up everywhere. They made a decent cheesesteak but you could get that in a lot of places in Philly. This place probably does a better job than most with their pork sandwiches.

Looking for that familiar flavor, I ordered the roast pork with broccoli rabe. There wasn't anything really on the lighter end but I did find and order the cooked spinach side dish. The sandwich was exactly what I expected and I enjoyed every bite. The spinach side was tiny and a bit salty but otherwise good.

When you look at the range of high-end restaurants we have in town, this place knocked most of them on their ass.  We went for a birthday celebration.  There were five of us.  Everything was great.  Some things were better than others, but everything was better than food I have at places like Le Bec Fin or any Starr place or JG Domestic.  

It's a four course price fixe (though you can opt for a 9 course Chef's tasting).  The price is pretty reasonable for what you get and the quality of the food.  

What I had:
1.  The Foie Gras Soup -- I hate soup and am not a huge foie gras fan, but this had received such rave reviews that I had to try it.  And it didn't disappoint.  Very tasty, very smooth.  
2.  Fish n' Chips -- I admit I ordered this as a safety in case I didn't like the soup, but these were not like any fish n' chips I've ever had.  The first bite was packed with flavor and spice.  The batter was light and fluffy and fish, perfect.  This was actually my favorite course of the night.  I highly recommend it.
3.  The Meatloaf -- Terrific, again.  Flavorful and the exact right portion.  
4.  The Apple Caramel -- this was my least favorite course.  Really nothing special, but fine.  Others got the Hot Chocolate (which is a mousse) and I think were much happier. 

Overall, this place is one of the best I've eaten at in Philly.  I am a picky eater and I cleaned my plate during every course.  

The service and atmosphere were great as well.  It's a small place with an open kitchen so you can see everything.  If I go back, I'd love to sit at the bar and watch them cook.

We kept trying each new place as it opened but until Capofitto opened in Old City  we had searched in vain. We had already been fans of Capogiro gelato and wondered if the owners could work the same magic with pizza. I am happy to say that the owner, Stephanie, has succeeded!
Look carefully for Capofitto near the intersection of 3rd and Chestnut across the street from a huge construction site that will be the Museum of the American Revolution at 123 Chestnut Street. The renovations to the old paper factory have been done with sensitivity to preserving the past - large windows from the original building separate the front gelato counter, bar, slicing machine area from the dining room. Cheerful red chairs, original tin walls, funky glass and metal fixtures set a warm and inviting tone. Much has been written about the blue tiled pizza oven built with stone and even sand brought from Italy which anchors the back of the long restaurant. That oven can produce a pizza in just a few minutes.
We have stuck to ordering the excellent charcuterie board with your choice of thinly hand sliced, prosciutto, mortadella, speck or soppresata acompanied by little pots of mostarda, preserved vegetables and fabulous house made foccia. 
Then - the pizzas! These are authentic Italian style individual pizzas - although they could conceivably be shared. We love the Calabrese with spicy sausage, the Diavola, the Tartufo and the Margarita. The crust is soft and chewy, slightly charred from the wood burning oven. The mozzarella is fresh and tasty.  There are other offerings on the menu but we have stuck to the pizza.
Save room for the intensely flavored gelato. Hazelnut and coconut are two of my favorites although there are more than 20 flavors (which change seasonally) to choose from.

From the regular menu, the harpoon-caught swordfish was 5 star all the way, with perfectly, and I mean perfectly cooked, snappy snap peas.  The fish so tender and fresh, so melt in your mouth with exceptional taste-bud tingling, one of the best I've ever had.

After drinking a ton of $3 beers, my appetite was still alive, had to try the desserts.

Most of the menu is variations of their specialty dish, a soup/stew called sun du bu.  It's got a red broth and lots of tofu as well some meat or something else, depending on the variety you order.  The soup is literally boiling when it arrives at your table, and depending on how you order it, it's pretty hot in the other way, also.  You are provided with a raw egg to crack into the soup if you wish.  You also get a pot of rice, a variety of tiny side dishes and a drink that I understand is essentially iced tea made with buckwheat instead of tea.

My three companions and I really enjoyed this place.  The one problem we had was that one of our friends is a strict vegetarian and it was difficult for us to determine which things on the menu were truly vegetarian, partly because of the limited English of the servers.  She doesn't want meatless soup if it is made with beef broth, for example. It was pretty clear that we weren't going to be able to communicate that to our waitress, so she got the pancake with scallions.

The reviews on Yelp weren't bad, but not great either.  But there was something appealing about eating at a place that has been around for as long as it has (it's the second oldest Italian restaurant in the country, and the oldest continually run by the same family).

My friend and I decided to give it a whirl.  We were seated in the corner and chose to split the Bruschetta appetizer.  She ordered the ravioli and I ordered the fettucini with tomato sauce (both from the ""homemade selections"" portion of the menu).  The waiter actually brought us a comped roasted pepper and mozzarella salad because he felt we had to wait to long for him to take our order (he was manning the take out calls).  This was a great gesture and a reflection of the type of service we'd receive for the rest of the evening.

The salad was divine.  I usually add salt or pepper to a salad like this, but it was seasoned to perfection, with just the right amount of olive oil and garlic, and the cheese was so fresh!  The Bruschetta was also delicious - perfect texture/toast on the bread, with fresh tomatoes really brightening the dish.

My fettucini was good, too.  The sauce was a bit plain but it really allowed the freshness of the pasta to shine through.  And it tasted homemade, which was just the touch of comfort I needed today.  I was disappointed to find out that the only homemade pastas they serve are the lasagna and linguini, but they do buy the pasta fresh from the market down the street.

The waiter insisted I take my leftovers home and even gave us extra bread.  The food was authentic and the staff was great.

But here is the deal, your experience at the place will depend on the mood of this guy, I think his name is Adil or something. When they first opened, it was Adil and Mahamoud. While Mahamoud was around, I had the best customer experience. But the day Mahamoud stopped working there, I've had the worst time. 

Adil will hit on the women (especially if you are two or more women in the group), and will treat the men like shit. If you do not look like you're from Saudi, and if you are male, you can only pray that Adil will be in a good mood to treat you like a human being. The later you come to this joint aka after midnight or 1am, the higher your chances are of being treated like crap. He is very very visibly on coke or extremely high, and will often get aggressive with the guys for no reason. 

Keep in mind, I've been coming here for over a year, and this has happened atleast 5-6 times with me, and I've seen it countless times with other customers.

This Italian bakery is located inside of Reading Terminal Market, which is an incredible place for any kind of foodie at all.

I got 4 cannoli that I would save for dinner that night. It is usually a good idea to eat a cannolo shortly after purchasing, to enjoy the crispy shell before it gets soft from the filling. The cannoli at Termini Bros. are filled on-demand (which is the ideal way). You can choose from a vanilla custard or the more traditional ricotta. My favorite pastry filling is probably sweetened ricotta, having spent most of my life eating cream puffs filled with ricotta from Mozzicato on Franklin Avenue in Hartford, CT. I asked about chocolate chips being present, as I am not a fan of this addition to the velvety smooth filling, and was informed that in fact, their ricotta mixture does have chocolate chips. Having read the reviews before coming to Termini Bros., I winced slightly and bought the cannoli anyway. At an average of 4 stars, I repeated silently to myself that 90 Yelpers cannot steer me wrong. For good measure, I also picked up tiramisu, presented in single-serving, round torte form.

That night, I helped prepare dinner for a really interesting group of people and shared my cannoli with them. I was smiling from ear-to-ear, pleased that I had not stuffed myself silly with the pork chop and orzo from dinner and glad that Yelpers did not let me down. The cannolo was delicious and the chocolate chips are actually more like shavings, not the chips that you find in your grocery store's baking aisle. This was absolutely acceptable, as I did not have to chomp on the chocolate.

I had the tiramisu the next day and even though it spent a day in the fridge, it was also very good. Good coffee flavor and the delicate mascarpone paired well with the cake layers.

Not only does this bakery have a decent selection of Italian pastries, cookies, and cakes, it is located in a wonderfully bustling market that makes for a fun experience.

On entering the restaurant, there is a small dining room and they lead you up some sketchy steps to where the karaoke rooms are. In the room, there was a large table surrounded by seats and a screen in the front with a computer for picking the songs. 

The service was pretty slow and it took a while to get a server in the room to order our food and drinks. The menu was .. interesting, definitely not like the normal Szechuan/chinese food we were used to. It was also a lot different than the menu we had seen online. Like a LOT different. The menu online has a huge variety of food items, most of them recognizable. The menu we were given had bacteria soup and dishes with blood.. it was like from a bad horror movie. I'm not sure why there was such a discrepancy. They did have some entrees that we recognized and those were what we ended up ordering. 

Once we ordered, the food came out VERY fast, like so fast that I think they probably have ready made food and they just warm it up when a dish is ordered. It tasted like that too.. pretty terrible overall. The scallion pancakes were greasy and lukewarm. The cashew chicken was the same plus was flavorless. The fried rice was completely flavorless and looked like frozen rice you would microwave at home. The dan dan noodles were oily and gross, not spicy at all, and were lightyears away from the Han Dynasty dan dan noodles. The beef with broccoli and general tso's were fine, but still not on par with standard chinese delivery food, which I think is not that great to begin with.

After a 2nd try and a 2nd chance for this much hyped Phila phenomenon, I swear to myself as well as to those I know - I have given it too many chances and will never return!!

What is so BAD about this place? Briefly, food and service are the main problem. Otherwise it is fine if you like the kind of food they call Chinese or Szechuan, which seems to me didn't even undergo cooking. It is basically just all pre-cooked stuff, vegetables and noodles (mushy, BTW) etc, overdosed with whatever sauce (spicy and greasy, sweet and/or nutty etc..) before served to you. Let me explain in detail..

First the food. Well, it is food and kinda of edible, I agree that much, but not much more. We ordered the cold & spicy cucumber, which should be a super cheap and served cold so it's commonly a summer dish. It is usually made with crunchy fresh cucumbers, which are plentiful in the summer. The key to this dish is that the kind of cucumbers makes a huge difference. It has to be the flavorful Asian variety which are also dark green colored outside with very small to none seeds. English cucumber would be a closest substitution. The regular large, thick skinned, and tasteless variety with large and mature seeds, and are easily found at the supermarket here in this country simply would not serve the purpose. OK, just what I suspected, we were served with a bowl of this far inferior variety of cucumbers. Not only that, it is not EVEN ""cooked"". By ""cooked"" I mean this dish needs to be tossed with just the right amount of fresh chilly oil and freshly crushed garlic, a dash of Szechuan paper, the right level of sugar and salt, and that is all there is to it. Instead, the normally dark green skinned cucumber dish sitting in front of us is, ok, large, pale (peeled) tasteless cucumber cubes swimming in some sort of light brown gooey sauce. I braved myself with some of the saucy cubes, and they tasted way too sweet! And the sauce is, umm, some sort of peanut based, is my best guess. 

Another simple cold dish - Dan Dan Noodles came way too mushy, clearly pre-cooked and sitting way too long to be ordered. It once again came with sweet sesame based sauce. Aside from being overly sweet, the main problem with this dish is the texture of the noodles. We might just like them better if we didn't still have nice and youthful chewing capability...

I began to get suspicious about whether they actually do cook the dishes per customers' order or if they simply just combine the ingredient with what else... a sauce before serving.. The much raved mapo tofu might be a good indicator, I thought. Sure enough, it came overwhelmed with grease and a kind of spicy sauce. The tofu looked just like any other packaged stuff one can get at an Asian grocery store, nothing special. Just as I suspected, the dish was lukewarm, suggesting it was NOT freshly COOKED in a sizzling hot wok as most Chinese food should be.

I could just go on and on with the remaining dishes we ordered - all came to us by the same cooking method, I could tell, which is NO COOKING - pre-cook all the main ingredients, then toss in generous amount of sweet, spicy and/or nutty sauce before serving.

On a Friday night during prime dinner time, the fiancé and I were searching for somewhere to eat after running some errands in center city. We always walk by this place so I've always wanted to try it but the opportunity never came up until today.

WHAT WE GOT: Grilled chicken margherita flatbread, grilled salmon, scallops dinner special

PROS: Nice decor/ambiance with friendly and attentive staff. The kitchen is on full display on the side of the restaurant but it adds a nice touch to the place. The food was pretty okay; nothing super special but nothing to be mad at either. The price matched the portion sizes and the freshness of the food. Loved the sweet but tangy honey mustard glaze on my salmon, which was cooked nicely. The mashed potatoes were also pretty good and so was the flatbread. I mean you can't really go wrong with chicken, cheese, and pesto.

CONS: The asparagus that came with the dish were a bit cold and my fiancé's risotto and spinach were both kinda sort on seasoning. It also took a little bit for the appetizer to come out even though the restaurant wasn't really busy. There's also minimum walking space in between some of the tables. 

Random thoughts from the fiancé: Our waiter Tyler was friendly and provided great service. It seemed though that his area was kinda spread out and disjointed with some tables being inside and some being outside which slowed service down.

The decor added to the Moroccan theme of the restaurant. Once seated, you're given a towel to place over your lap to wear throughout dinner. Also, you cleanse your hands with rose water before eating.

I had a few stand-by burrito places back in my old city, and Mexicali (at least initially) filled the need for a steaming bolus of cheese, rice, meats and what-have-you very nicely. They had warm, homemade tortillas, Jarritos (what's an Americanized Burrito place without Jarritos soda?), and idiosyncratic combinations like pork, plantains and sweet potato that, despite all odds, worked incredibly well.

Then, slowly but surely, a dark cloud of shit rained its contents down upon this small business so thoroughly that I will never come here again. First, it was the odd hours. Often I would tug my friends by the arm down Walnut street, eager to introduce a homemade tortilla, fried ""chimichanga style"" into their skeptical mouths only to find  ""closed come back later"" scrawled in black marker on a torn piece of paper in the doorway. This happened an alarming amount of times. 3:30 on a sunday? CLOSED. 6:00 on a Tuesday night? BAM CLOSED, FUCK You JEREMY.

Still, when I could get a burrito from this place, Mexicali delivered. That is, until they changed the menu. Gone were the quirky combos, gone was the beloved chimichanga style. In its place was the generic choose 3 ingredients model adopted by most chain burrito places across the country. The high quality ingredients were still there, but the resultant burritos were far less action-packed (i.e. had less stuff) than their ancestors. My excitement for Mexicali waned, but I still poked my sullen head in for a 'ritto another time or two.

The final nail in the coffin, not a week later, was the discontinuation of the homemade tortilla. The owner's (or at least I am assuming the incredibly defensive and unfriendly woman who fielded my concerns was the owner) reason? ""Well, every other place in the city has store-bought tortillas."" Mexicali, this is what made you stand out! Mexicali has removed almost every reason to choose it over Chipotle next door, and that is a sad sad thing.

I am definitely willing to go back to Mexicali if ever I hear that they went back to their old ways, but for now they have lost a formerly loyal customer entirely.",2012-04-02 21:22:13,"{'food': ['burrito', 'chimichanga style'], 'drink': ['Jarritos']}"

The wait wasn't too bad for just a two-top, about 15 minutes. The eggs benedict was everything they said it would be. I added a potato latke because everyone kept raving about it and it was delicious (although, it's hard to fry a potato and make it not delicious to me!) with a necessary side of apple sauce and sour cream- yum! 

I can definitely see what all the hype is about. I like the benches outside for waiting if it's nice weather and they have outdoor seating, which is always a plus. The inside was quite small, but in a nice way, very Philly-ish. If you've been a fan of Sabrina's in the Italian Market, I get the same vibe from this place (although the patrons are more hipster here). I think the service here is better than most.

The pizza had no flavor, but that's probably because there was about the thinnest and smallest amount of sauce ever. I might as well had ordered a white pizza.. 

The Italian hoagie tasted like it was mostly ham and even then it tasted just like bologna. I'm not even sure if they had salami or capicola in the hoagie. The chicken quesadilla was really bland. The reuben sandwich didn't come with sauerkraut and came with regular bread instead of rye.

The pizzas came and the cauliflower had the pancetta on every slice so it had to be sent back. Once it did come back correct, it was good.

There were 8 of us seated at our table, and it wasn't until after we arrived that we discovered the happy hour special on drinks was only available at the bar.

I found her tone to be somewhat rude. She also said each person usually ordered 2-3 dishes on their own...but our party was there for HH, not necessarily dinner. So we waited 30 minutes for the the whole party to arrive to order the original 5 dishes anyway. Strike 2.

While the food took an eternity to come out, everything was quite good: 

The Nyum Sahdau salad, which I ordered based on the server's recommendation (after he asked me if I was an adventurous eater), has cabbage, bitter melon flowers, shredded chicken, cucumber and what I am pretty sure is sliced jalapenos that look deceivingly like green beans.

The Sah-Law Ka-Koe-- a stew with choice of chicken or pork and pumpkin, and eggplant -- was also really good. And OMG the meatball skewers-- If you eat meat, order these! They are the fantastic! 

All in all it was a great meal, even though they jacked up our take out order and accidentally gave my brother the really spicy dish that he ended up having to throw out!  I look forward to going back, but hopefully when it's not as busy.

Do's and don't of this place:

DOs:
1. Have dim sum if you need a place in Northeast. But, there is a lot more choices in Chinatown. However, great if you don't feel like driving and you are in this area.
2. Have dinner here. Tasty and generous portions plus good service.
3. Have lunch here. The rice dishes are awfully cheap, tasty and generous.

DON'Ts:
1. Be rude when they are busy. The staff here try as hard as they can but they are people too. If you have a request, ask and be patient (they are not slow, anyway).
2. NEVER EVER order the HK style wontons. Even someone's little five year old child can wrap better wontons. Plus, the filling is so pathetically scarce, you can say it is non-existent; so they try to give you like 16-20 little wontons - which equates to eating 16-20 little wonton wrappers with no filling.

I thought the brisket (still char siu) was cooked really well and I appreciated that they gave a decent amount. Again, I didn't think it was bad, just that it wasn't amazing.

Location: not bad, Sansom is one of my favorite streets in Philly. The new space is well decorated and pretty well set up. There is an entrance on one side that leads directly to the order station, and there is a assembly line and large pick up area after. The waiting area is a bit tight, but even with the large crowd I wasn't uncomfortable. I like that you can see the entire kitchen (completely open). We sat against the wall, and it was ample space to lay out our food.

Service: friendly enough and efficient. You can hear as they call your order number too. Didn't see many order mistakes and the manager was on top of things. The wait in line took about 20 minutes (unacceptable for lunch fare, but not their fault persay) and the food took about 10 (a bit long when they had a massive pile of burgers cooked and ready). At this point I can't sink so much time over my lunch break so be aware of this point. 

Food: I ordered a cheeseburger with cheddar (medium) and red onions and a side of truffle fries. 

Burger first: The bun is good, but not what I expected. It has the texture of stale bread, but this ended up being great. the burger held in place wonderfully and it did not fall apart like the softer potato rolls for example. My burger was cooked great but was extremely salty on one side. The cheddar was rubbery and flavorless, and the onions were very overcooked, mushy and flavorless. The side of pickles was unexpected and a bonus (I love pickles!). Good size in my opinion, but my food mate thought it was too small for the price (almost looked like a slider, 5.5oz uncooked patty). Overall it was a good burger, but not great. Out of 5 I would give it 3. If the cheese and onions were better, it would gain +1 because the meat was tasty and juicy (the heart if you will). 

The truffle fries were a gigantic portion for $2... we should have shared a single order. They were awesome and the smell of truffles was fantastic. The flavor was not overpowering, almost subtle addition to the fries. The fries were not at all greasy which I really, really appreciate and the way they were cut was great. Some were nice and crunchy and some were soft so there was alot to like here. Fries get 5 out of 5! The spicy fries were on par with these. 

Milkshake: god I wish I ordered one after seeing them make it : ) but I am sure my wallet (5 bucks!) and my stomach thank my brain for saving them. From the looks of it though, it would have raised the rating 1 star alone! haha. 

Value: was the burger worth $5.50? in my ideal world... no. but comparatively in the market it wasn't outrageous. Total meal cost without drink was $9 after tax and I think that is slightly too much considering what you get, but we could have also split the $2 fries for how many you get. I couldn't make this a 'regular' place to eat as I don't see the value. 

Summary: The wait times were prohibitive of a lunch time meal, and the value is right on the border of being overpriced (the jury is still out) but I enjoyed the meal enough that I would go back. 2 stars is not mean to be a put down, and I think it is accurate of the food and experience. I hope the lines get more manageable at lunch time though. 

*Me and my friend made an over/under bet on if this place would last. Goodburger didn't survive a year for the same issues I brought up with 500d (value, wait time).

After going out for PYT at the piazza and loving it, we decided it's a bit far for us to go there every week, so after looking around Yelp, we settled for 500 Degrees. It earns point from me just by naming it a numeric symbol.

Outside the door, there's a burger of the week sign with some interesting concept burgers.  Upon entering and after reading the menu, I asked for a ""Heat Lover Combo"" and I repeated myself 3 times because apparently the server has never heard of the Heat Lover before and I have to point at the sign right next to the cash register and tell him I want that burger in a combo. In which he told me that the special burgers don't come available in a combo. Huh? Is it so difficult to put that in a combo deal like all the regular burgers they have here? (After reviewing their facebook page, apparently a lot of burgers of the week comes in a combo pack, so I don't know what the problem was)

Anyway, after ordering that and a 500 burger combo with mushrooms, we sat at the well lit dining room and started analyzing. The burgers were quite superb, perfect sized, good soft buns with a juicy, soft, meaty patty that goes perfectly with the cheddar. The special sauce in the 500 burger is tasty and the bacon added some crispiness. The grill has slightly charred the outside and give it a smokiness that's ever so alluring. The special sauce and a lite dijon mustard is also served at the table that undoubtedly enhance the flavor of any burgers.

The Heat Lover burger has a lovely pickled jalapeno peppers on top that tickle the taste buds but not enough to give you an intense heat. The spicy fries and the truffle fries are also a bit weak in flavor, so was my chocolate shake. I wonder if the fries can benefit with just a tad more salt and pepper or the flavoring it promised. The fries are also a bit on the soft side. 

The burger outweighs the bad, with a well lit place and an affordable menu, it's still very much worth coming back again.

Equal parts dedication, curiosity, humor, food science and a downright disregard to convention, this place is to Asian food what Tired Hands Brewing Co. is to beer.
Meaning, it's fairly apparent after spending just a few minutes inside that it's their weird world -  you're just living in it.

The staff is fast-paced, fun and very open to being actual humans if you care to engage them (that is, of course, if you're into that sort of thing). The music is always good, loud and fitting (how often do you get to enjoy 'Po' Folks' by the Nappy Roots while crushing a bowl of pork shoulder and ramen noodles?).
The drinks are nuanced. And after having sampled nearly everything on their menu at least once, it wouldn't be hard to share specifics as to why this place deserves such unabashed praise for existing. But then again, why take the fun out of it? 

Every inch of this tiny, bustling, cramped-as-hell space screams ""Hey! We give a shit about what we do!"", so go experience it already. Leave your expectations on the curb. Forget everything you just read. Try and find a seat. Order a dish or three. Drink a beer. Shut your f*cking mouth and eat the f*cking magic.

Oh yeah, and don't fall asleep on their rotating list of housemade juice. It doesn't get a lot of attention living under the shadow of their foodstuffs, but it damn well deserves some.

We waited for several minutes and I usually would rather die than return a well mixed drink to the bar but as it was my last drink of the night and I really couldn't get past the bitterness of the Campari, so I waited for more than a few minutes to kindly ask the server if she would mind switching out my drink (a bit of a pain in the ass I know) but she never checked on how we liked our drinks so my husband decided to go upto the bar and ask directly.

I came here entirely based on Yelp reviews, figuring that a near-perfect rating from over 200 reviewers couldn't go wrong. The cafe itself is in a rather charming part of town, and although it is rather small, it also screams cleanliness and efficiency. The owner greeted us immediately, and let us peruse the various items on the menu with an amused look on his face before we finally gave up and admitted we had no idea how to order. He explained what chaat was, and that we shouldn't be overwhelmed by the multitude of choices written on the board - we should just tell him what type of meat we wanted and our desired spice level, and he'd take care of the rest. My boyfriend got lamb, spicy, and I got chicken, medium spice. We also ordered mango and pineapple lassi.

The lassi was amazing - I don't think I'll ever be content with a smoothie ever again. Mango taste was light and airy, not too sweet, but enough to satisfy any craving. The Pineapple lassi was very refreshing, and offered the perfect blend of flavor and sweetness. Even better, with our lassi we got a little cup with the leftover drink (I'm guessing they made extra), which was perfect for sharing. 

When I got my chaat, my first instinct was to say ""Eeww, how do these even go together...?"" Radishes, cilantro sauce, mangoes, honeyed dates, chick peas, fried dough strips, chicken pieces, several types of mystery sauce? I then dubiously mixed everything together and took a tentative bite. 

It was an absolute explosion in my mouth, a taste sensation I've never had before. Sweet, sour, savory, salty, spicy, and everything in between - all in perfect balance. Saying that it was delicious would be an understatement. My chicken chaat was seriously awesome, and my boyfriend's lamb chaat was even better. It literally comes down to personal preference what meat/veggie you get, but I don't think you can go wrong.

This place makes the 2.5 hour drive from Maryland to Penn worth it. Would I recommend this place? Absolutely. The owner is super friendly, helpful, and service-oriented. The food is a mind-blowing culinary experience. My only qualm with this place is that if you don't order a lassi, the serving sizes for the chaat might not be enough to fill you up completely (but since I did order a lassi, I ended up staggering out the door due to how full I was).

I was disappointed I didn't get to try the brisket and wagyu burger sliders, but it was nice to have dishes constantly brought to me.

The menu included (for $30):

seasonal salad (I didn't ask the kind)
Cornbread
Pimento Cheese (on a little toast)
Blackened Catfish (atop grits)

Hot (Fried) Chicken
Collard Greens
Mac and Cheese
One Rib (I didn't ask whether it was beef or pork)
Triple Chocolate Cake

I thought it was a great deal for $30 because every dish except the mac and cheese and the rib weren't the best kind of that dish I ever had. The hot fried chicken was also a little too hot for me, but it was great.

The salad, whatever is was, had nothing but dark green lettuces and kale, none of that light green, lacking-nutrient garbage. It was one of the better salads I've had in the city. The cornbread (in a skillet) was great as well, though the edges were a little too crispy for me, so I only ate the center. The pimento cheese was good, but spicier than I'm used to (although I only ever really had it on a burger...). 

I'm making a new paragraph for the catfish because it was the greatest fish dish I ever had. I even liked the grits, too! I never had grits before, but I'm glad I tried them here.

The Hot Chicken was delicious, the second best fried chicken I've had in the city. Though, I'm gonna be honest, it was too hot for me, so I picked off the breading/sauce. The collard greens (turkey leg, potlikker) were delicious as well. I only ever had collard greens once, but they were better here. The mac and cheese was good, but could've used more cheese. The rib was good, but I would've preferred it be fall-off-the-bone tender. The triple chocolate cake was great, too

My boyfriend and I made sure to order a variety from their menu, and overall I was satisfied but also that I could've made a better choice for our semiannual restaurant week date. I would give Aldine a 3.5 if there were half star ratings.

My choices for the night were the kampachi crudo, onion soup, duck breast, and panna cotta. 

FIRST:
The kampachi was fresh and combined new culinary ideas of textures and flavors. I have had crude dishes in Philadelphia in which the sauce overpowered the freshness of the fish, but this was not the case for Aldine. They nailed the balance.
SECOND:
The onion soup I found far too sour for my palate, and you shouldn't order this expecting something similar to the classic French onion soup. My boyfriend's pork belly option was the clear winner in this case. This is the surf-and-turf (pork belly and squid) of my dreams and definitely the highlight of the night. 
THIRD:
I was surprised at how filling the portion of duck breast was for a Restaurant Week meal. Again, the citrus notes of the sauce did not overpower the flavor of the duck meat and I was able to enjoy a quality cut of meat for its natural flavor. 
FOURTH:
The panna cotta was in all honesty a terrible way to end my meal. It may have been the chef's intention, but the panna cotta was not set at all and I was served a bowl of gelatinous goo. If the flavor was delicious, it may have been forgivable, but I found my dessert to be too salty.

I've been a vegetarian for many moons, so hot dogs are just a faraway childhood taste memory for me. The opportunity to be reunited with a hot dog was just too tempting to pass up. However, these dogs are much more sophisticated than those of my youth- a quick glance at the chalkboard menu had me weak in the knees with its wide variety of wildly creative hot dog toppings. Feeling overwhelmed, I asked the friendly dude behind the counter for recommendations, and he suggested the Seattle Grunge, the Fiesta Dog, or the Big Kahuna. I, being the huge jerk that I am, still couldn't resist ordering the Saigon Fusion after he gave me three perfectly good recommendations. The description just spoke to me. He thought it was funny though, so I guess we're cool. 

The presentation was gorgeous in its simplicity- the cilantro and cucumbers were nestled lovingly underneath the dog, the shredded carrots and hot peppers evenly covered the top, and the entire thing was artfully drizzled in a sweet chili sauce. The flavors were spot on and I wish my friend had timed me to see how fast I actually wolfed it down. It was kind of hard to keep part of the dog inside the bun and to keep all the flavors integrated in one delicious bite, but I messily managed. The only reason this spot earned 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm a big texture person and the dog was on the dry side. I was hoping for a bit more juiciness.  The dryness may just be an inconsistency in my particular hot dog though. Even if it wasn't, that's not going to stop me from going back and trying every single dog on the menu.

As I was killing time and not hungry, I did not order anything to eat, but decided to have a beer - an Alagash that was tasty. The beer hit me and I looked around and saw a decent Scotch selection and decided to treat myself to a Laphroig which was fairly inexpensive when considering the happy hour discount. There was also a great happy hour discount on the beer.

The bartender was super helpful and attentive and there was a nice group of people there. I would totally hang out at this bar, and they have a whole table area which I imagine would be great for dining.

I had a celery root custard. It was flavorful and artful on the plate with watermelon radish and other greens. It was creamy and flavorful. Just the right variance in textures.
My wife had the crudo of the day which she quickly ate up. I do not even remember what it was. 
For the second course, I had a decadent fois gras sausage. The consistency was excellent and the mixture of cranberry and pistachio added the right touch to the course.
My wife on suggestion of the waiter ordered sweet potato as something light between her first and second course. She again ate it quickly and decided it was the right choice.

It's become our go-to restaurant for out of town guests.  Ambiance is warm and cute.  The only consistently mediocre thing is the service.  The servers have always been very sweet and accommodating, but they lack professionalism / experience.

I've visited Las Cazuelas three times, each time with my boyfriend and out of town guests.  Each time, our party was very happy with the food and pleasantly surprised, given preconceptions of Mexican food as well as the neighborhood.  (Neighborhood is fine, but that strip of Girard is not where you're expecting to find great food.)  On the first visit, our guests sniffed at the prices for Mexican food but ended the meal gushing about how good it was and planning to return.  (We've been trained that Mexican dishes over $10 must be overpriced.)

The entrees come to the table beautifully plated.  All eyes at the table light up!  Our favorites include the Chipotle shrimp, and the Chile Relleno.  My sister is a mole aficionado  and loved their mole sauce.  My ""difficult"" friend ordered the Arroz con Pollo, and loved it.

And it passed my test of whether I could just as easily have made the dish at home.  The only mediocre dish we've seen was the beef tips - uninspired.  This isn't five star fancy food, but it is as good as most of the good byob's in Philly.  And it's inexpensive by comparison.  Bring a bottle of Tequila and they'll make you a decent Margarita pitcher for $6.  

Regarding the service, our worst visit was a mid-week visit.  They were out of the ingredients to mix Sangria with our bottle of Red Wine and they didn't have any specials.  The server explained that the chef hadn't been in that day!  We didn't need to hear that.  All three entrees came out lovely and delicious, but there was such an uneasy feeling as we waited, wondering if we shouldn't have come that night.",2011-12-08 15:02:39,"{'food': ['Chipotle shrimp', 'Chile Relleno', 'Pork Chop'], 'drink': ['Margarita pitcher']}"

Great service, amazing wine and beer selection topped off with delicious food to go with your drinks. There are many things that I love about this place, but here are a few highlights: 
- The truffled egg toast with fontina cheese... this was featured as one of the best sandwiches on Grub Street. This might be my favorite thing on the menu... there is something just so delicious about a combination of buttery toast, egg, and cheese. It's not just for breakfast!
- Great selection of wines... the Pecorino stands out if you ask me. 
- Flourless espresso chocolate cake with mascarpone and hazelnut. I shouldn't even need to explain this one - just look at the name! This flourless cake has a wonderful richness that isn't overwhelming, and the mascarpone adds a nice light accompaniment to the chocolate. 
- If you're in the mood for a meaty dish, the Italian meat plate was pretty solid. It also comes with some sides like garlic paste and peppers which are nice garnishes too. 

Apparently there can be a little bit of a wait sometimes... it's not a huge place (but according to other reviews this location is bigger) so when I arrived with my party of 3 at 6pm on a Saturday we were given about a 15-25 min wait. But, we were a little impatient and wanted to get started since we were going to a Kimmel Center concert at 8, so we asked to get seated at the bar. The great thing about the bar is that service is good and swift - there is always someone around to take your order and they are all pretty nice :).

I was guaranteed it would be beautiful and I had to take it home and perform some DIY to make it pretty. 2) the cake was uneven on the surface, probably it has been sitting outside for too long. Part of the icing on the top had began to slide down. 
Now let's move on to customer service. No one at the shop was helpful, they simply shrugged when asked questions. They knew the cake looked horrible and said they couldn't do anything because their cake decorator was not around. I feel this place has no work ethics and don't care about their customers.

So, the other day, like I often do, I whipped out my I-phone, pulled up my Yelp app, and decided to see what was near by and rated well.

I was surprised to see after 40 reviews Bui's Lunch Truck had 4 1/2 stars, with a healthy littering of 5 star reviews.

So, I had to try it. A lot of reviews mentioned their breakfast sandwiches, but I am usually not the breakfast food for lunch type.

So, I decided on the Mr. Bui special sandwich. In a nutshell, it's a cheese steak with peppers and teriyaki sauce. The bread was a little on the crisp side. It tasted okay, but I prefer it a little softer. And, to be honest, for the extra buck, the peppers and teriyaki sauce were not worth it. But getting past that, the steak and cheese were good.

The restaurant is only half a block to my apartment, so I pass by it all the time and after trying it for the very first time when it first opened. I couldn't honestly call myself a fan. What can I say? I ordered the kebob and everybody who knows anything about Greek/Turkish food is that kebobs are the most generic thing on the menu and can't really reflect the skills of the chef. On top of that the restaurant is popular and the space is small with tables arranged very closed to each other and I'm a bit claustrophobic. At the end of the meal I freaked out  a little and had to run out of the restaurant to catch a breath. After that experience I was a bit afraid to go back. Then there was a pretty long and angry respond to a newspaper review that got pasted on the window of the kitchen, I'm sure I'm not the only one who got weirded out by it.

It wasn't until Food Network's The Best Thing I've Ever Ate that got me pay more attention to my Greek neighbor. I went back for the Cyprus breakfast promoted by the program and it was good, real good. Everything on the plate was done perfectly; Eggs are fried to a crispy edge with the center remains raw, bread is toasted to a crunchy goodness, lounza ham is salty and dry is a good way. and can I just scream how I love the Halloumi cheese especially when it's fried to a crispy outside and a melty inside? I can have that everyday and be content. 

A second visit to the same plate proves that it's better to visit on weekdays when there are less patrons and the cooks can pay more attention to the food. On weekends, the quality can suffer because of the rush. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly, the decor simple and homey. I think they took the kebob out of the menu and I remember the dip being stellar. They also seemed to have a cooking class held on weekends sometimes, check their glass window.

We started with an appetizer which had yellowtail and vegetables wrapped in seaweed, then tempura batter and deep fried. It was really good!

It is byo. Reasonable prices. Has outdoor seating. Good location right off broad (plenty of places to go for another drink). They give you metal chopsticks - not the cheap wood kind, which is a nice touch.

The place has a distinct Southwestern/Mexican vibe, giving it a unique atmosphere in a city where many places are carbon-copied from each other. I especially liked the Cinco De Mayo themed artwork in the windows.

First, a few minor service hiccups. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, but would sometimes take our coffee for refill before we were finished. I'm thinking of that scene in Coffee & Cigarettes, ""...I just got it the way I like it."" The wait for our food also seemed long considering how few people were there. I don't know if that had to do with the complexity of our food, but it did seem like others were getting their food out quicker. Finally, the eggs were not how I requested. I always like eggs to be runny when I eat hash, but mine were cooked hard. (Not that it killed the meal)

Now, the food- excellent. We started with the Ugly Donuts, tossed in cinnamon - a sweet and satisfying way to start the meal. Mary got the chicken quesadilla, at the server's suggestion. Quesadillas are generally hard to screw up, but rarely do I have one that actually makes me take note and say, ""Wow, that is really good!"" Of course, I had to say this through sips of cold water, as the jalapenos are intense, but it had to be said. Finally, I recieved my brisket hash, with my eggs, corn and peppers. I still have my leftovers here and I'm enjoying them as I type this.

And you know what else is great? The prices. All this for under $30. That made my day.

The estimated delivery was about an hour, but the food actually showed up in about 35 minutes. The deliveryman was very polite and affable. 

The food? Pretty damn good. I ordered the pechuga poblana, and my roommate the chicken burrito. If you don't know what pechuga poblana is, look it up. It's a classic mexican dish from Puebla, and when done right it's phenomenal. We also got an order of the guacamole. 

The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is that a small piece of the chicken in my pechuga poblana was tough and over cooked. The rest of it was excellent with a tasty, somewhat spicy poblana sauce inundating the entire meal. It comes with rice, beans, tortillas, and some cheese - oaxacan I think. Or maybe queso fresco. 

The guacamole was great too. Not too chunky but definitely not a boring paste. Could have used some more lime, but I may have an unreasonable desire for the citrus. The chips, though, were perfect. Obviously fried in-house, and the perfect thickness. 

I only had a bite of the burrito, but that was pretty good. My roommate inhaled it and said that it was ""awesome.""

Yikes. Only time we've ever tipped 10% on a dinner because the service was SO BAD it didn't even deserve 10%. 

We called in on a Friday night around 8 p.m. and the girl that picked up the phone said that they could take our reservation and it would be an hour so she transferred me to this guy and hes like absolutely not you have to be here to put your name in...So right there is a lapse in restaurant direction. So we went to PV and they were like yeah it will be an hour so go to a bar or something and come back. We wanted to grab wine for the dinner anyways so went to the bar at whole foods and ordered 2 beers and i get a text immediately that our table is ready and that it would be only held for 10 minutes. I called asking since we were told it would be an hour and to go to a bar, that it could be held for around a half hour. He said no and that there was a large group behind us waiting for seating. We chugged our beers and ran to PV where we were shown two bar seats, so clearly not the seating needed for a large group that we had to rush to get back. 

We ordered appetizers (salad and meatballs) and one of the pizzas, and we were disappointed to see it all come out at once, not only did we feel rushed and didn't have any room at the bar top (the pizza was literally in front of the woman next to us at the bar, so I'm sure she was annoyed) but the pizza ended up getting cold by the time we finished our apps. The salad and meatballs were very good, and pizza would have been good if it wasn't so cold. Just a note that the couple to my right also asked for their pizza to be warmed up. 

While we were eating cold pizza and our water carafe was empty, and we tried looking for our waiter when we saw him in his jacket with his bag exiting for the night. No introduction to the individual that was going be taking over our service for the rest of the night. We sat there for the better part of a half hour just trying to find someone to pay attention to us to order dessert. Keep in mind, it is about 10 p.m. and there were only about 4 tables still at the restaurant eating! My boyfriend ended up having to wave his hands to flag a waiter down. The waiter said ""you guys aren't getting enough love aren't you?"" Um...rude? but you're right, we were not. We ordered cannolis (still didn't get our water) and by this point, we were waiting and waiting for someone to bring us our check. My boyfriend had to go up to the counter to have someone give us our check because we were just so annoyed with trying to flag someone down.

Food tried (all apps):
Crab cakes -$12 gets you 2 mini crab cakes with a kettle cooked chip crust, NO fillers - delicious

Duck Spring Rolls - $8 - Very crispy and fresh tasting but couldn't really taste the duck. The dipping sauce did little to add contrasting flavors - probably wouldn't order again but only because the other items were so much better

Lamb Sliders - hands down favorite. For $10 you get 3 mini lamb ""burgers"" with a cranberry aioli that complimented the lamb flavor perfectly

Drinks tried (I have no clue what they are called and the drink menu isn't posted on the website!)
VooDoo something or other : I believe this was the cocktail with red wine. Refreshing and warming at the same time. A tart fruity flavor served up with an orange twist. Highly recommended

Something with muddled cucumber : Great description right? Well it's the only drink that comes with muddled cucumber so that should make it easy. This drink is light, refreshing, the pear vodka is not overpowering and adds a sweeter flavor to the mellow and earthy cucumber. It's a perfect summer cocktail and reminds me of a Pim's Cup (very common cocktail in New Orleans). Served in a high ball glass with a cucumber slice.

Ended up snagging a seat right next to the window overlooking the western part of the city. Let's be honest, the views are the whole reason people go here right? But I think the only reason we were fortunate enough to get a window seat is because we arrived here as soon as they opened up their doors at 5pm on a Sunday. (We made reservations for that slot ahead of time online thru Open Table). However, within just one hour of being there the place was packed with people so getting a window seat at that time would've been impossible...unless you put down a hefty couple hundred dollar down payment/deposit to guarantee it (at least according to their website).

Overall, the food choices on the Restaurant Week menu were pretty good and tasty. Fine dining establishments aren't really my first go-to whenever I dine out, so it was a pleasant experience to change it up and order things I would otherwise never try.

But what really made R2L unique in my opinion however, are two things--the entrance experience and the service.

When you are trying to find out where to enter Two Liberty Place you'll see a sign for R2L off of 16th street. Walk in thru that door and veer to the right--you'll see that they have their very own carpeted walkway leading up to...yep...their very own elevator; whoah!! It only goes up to the 37th floor and back down again so it's definitely theirs. It was great timing to travel up with one of their new hostess hires (Tiffany) who was so friendly and charming.

When you first arrive in the lobby on that 37th floor, the entrance way is dimly lit mood lighting which contrasts well to the interior natural light inside the actual restaurant. As soon as you enter the main restaurant you'll feel like you're on top of the world, because, well you are and well, it's a high-class place.

Tiffany seated us by the window and our wonderful server, Hannah, took care of us and went that extra mile to make sure we were accommodated. Obviously she knew we weren't the typical fine diners that do this every day. People who do fine dining all the time are probably the ones complaining about the little things here. We should be thankful for what we do receive because we often take for granted how lucky we are in life. We sat there as Hurricane Irma was bombarding Florida so I got to thinking about things. Guess being so high up in the sky will encourage that sort of reflection, I dunno.

Hannah even went so far as to spell out the word ""congratulations"" in chocolate on my dining companion's dessert plate to honor her moving into a new apartment recently that I briefly mentioned. It's the little things that make a big difference, ya know?

The food came out super quick (probably because we were there early), but we didn't feel rushed when it started to get more crowded. An amazing experience all around. And some great photos to take back with us. You surely won't be disappointed, unless of course you're looking for something to be disappointed about.",2017-09-12 16:50:14,"{'food': ['dishes'], 'drink': []}"

Dealing with an unexpectedly warm October evening, our initial plans of ""warming up with some yummy broth"" were not necessary, but we had a craving, and the only thing that could sate my buddy and I was ca-noodling at Cheu. We strolled in around 7:20 and the place was nowhere close to full. There were about 3 people at the bar and two sitting down, so we were immediately seated at the window. The inside of Cheu is warm and welcoming, the chalkboard showing off the daily specials (tea, beers, food, etc). A carafe of ice water was brought to our table, menus placed in front of us, and we were excited for a night out.

Cue when things took a turn for the questionable. I'm not sure if this is standard fare for Cheu, or just due to being a little bare bones, but we had two servers visiting our table periodically. I initially thought maybe one would just be to refresh our water, but they (a man and a woman) would follow after the other often less than a minute behind, asking the same questions. 

""Have you decided on a drink?"" ..... ""Can I get you ladies some drinks?""

Wait. Didn't I just tell that guy we weren't ready yet?

""Can I get that plate off the table for you yet?"" (Oh, no, we're still working on it, thanks.) .... ""Hey, want me to clear that plate for you, girls?""

No, we haven't even taken another bite since that lady stopped by... what is happening?

If they looked even moderately similar, I'd have felt insane deja vu that would've suggested that I, too, was insane.

As far as food goes, we enjoyed the shaved kale with dates, pepitas, and cheese curds, coconut curry (for my vegetarian pal) and classic miso ramen with pork shoulder. The curry was spicy and delicious, heavy on the broth and the heat. The more classic-style ramen was definitely jonesing for a little kick, added with chili oil and sriracha. Our duo of servers were attentive, almost to a fault. Like... interrupting us to check in, desiring seemingly bite to bite updates. That being said, the bites were quite tasty. The pork shoulder was a little tough, but otherwise all quite good. We enjoyed our cans of beer and our food, which was swept away immediately the second we finished our food. Our male server came over to let us know that, despite receiving our check, ""No hurry though, take your time.""

Five minutes later, the moment after we placed our card down for the check, the female server came over and, despite our earlier server letting us know ""no hurry"" she  told us, in no uncertain terms, that ""because we have a waiting list, we need you to leave the table.""

Ex-SQUEEZE ME? WHAT IS HAPPENING?!

Shocked by the sudden change in what we were supposed to do, we left, my friend just barely finishing the last of her drink.  I felt like this behavior totally ruined the experience for me, which was not going too poorly up to the point. But now, whenever I think of Cheu, I won't remember the ramen slipping through my chopsticks or the curdy kale.

However, I went back and I'm glad I did. Let's start with drinks: groothies are my favorite green smoothie in the city. Nice and thick, not too sweet, not too vegetable-y. And the winter hot chocolate with coconut whipped cream: chocolate-y, rich, and could eat a bowl of the whipped cream myself. So good!

Food: my favorite is the ""BLT"" salad with horseradish dressing: smokey and spicy and somehow transforms arguably gross tempeh into something really tasty. My favorite sandwich is the buffalo bella, though I would ask for light coleslaw next time: got soggy. I also enjoyed the quinoa chili several times last  fall/winter.

Marathon certainly fulfilled that requirement with plenty of outdoor seating along the sidewalk, perfect for people-watching. Next: mimosa time!

They should have either taken the sign down or offered a different drink on special to replace it. Then came the food: My omelet looked really good when it arrived, but when I tasted it, it was kinda gross.

As usual, I turn to Yelp for suggestions. Found this place and after looking at the menu, reading reviews and checking out the photos, we decided to head that way! 

We arrived around 10:45 am and gave our name to the young man who was hosting and he said it would be about a 50 min wait. We were prepared to wait and it was a gorgeous day so with some benches around the corner we sat down and enjoyed watching all the other people who were coming to Honey's. 

After about 40 min our name was called. The host said there were two counter seats (we had stated we'd be fine with that) and led us to the two best seats in the house. The counter had a small ""L"" to it and our seats gave us a perfect view of everything going on. 

We were immediately greeted by Bob who offered us coffee and anything else to drink. Giving us a few minutes to look over the menu, he let us know he'd be back in just a few minutes to take our order. We both decided to try the Honey Cristo and we were not disappointed. I also wanted to try a potato latke and my hubs wanted a side of the bacon truffle mashed potatoes. The kitchen was obviously cranking out orders as we didn't wait too terribly long for our food. The Honey Cristo had just a hint of sweet to it which complemented the savory flavor of the ham and cheese nicely. The eggs were perfectly sunny side up and there's nothing better than a runny yolk oozing over every potential bite. We forked our way through our meal and added bites of latke and mashed potatoes along the way. The mash was rich and delicious with bites of bacon and green onion dappled through and the latke was equally as delicious yet so different. Crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside with a fabulous oniony flavor. Super!

Bob continued to check on us and we couldn't have been more impressed with him and his service. After telling him we were from Texas, he shared that one of the owner's was also from Texas and how the restaurant came to be. Nice to have pleasant conversation even when the place was so busy but that's how good Bob was. He had everything under control. It looked like all of the waitstaff did...a well-oiled machine for sure. We also didn't feel rushed once we finished our meal. With busy places, sometimes they drop checks before you even finish your meal as to expedite turning tables over. Not here. While they certainly had every table filled and people outside waiting, they allow their customers to relax and enjoy they experience. When we finally left, we walked away feeling extremely satisfied with not only our food but service as well.

Upon sitting down you will receive a small bowl of their chickpea & pistachio crunch (not the official name i just made it up :)) it's the perfect bar snack, its crunchy and spicy the perfect snack to make you drink, and keep drinking. 

We've ordered the chef's tasting menu so we were able to really get a feel of the cuisine. I really like the olive oil potatoes which are served with a bacon jam and some kind of creamy goodness.  The buffalo pork belly is a must try, so is InRiva's take on bruschetta (I'm a fan of the whipped ricotta, fig and bacon version) the meat balls and Lamb sausage are also pretty good.  

They make great pizza, and the drinks are creative and delicious.  We like the Vona & Vivianni.

A close friend and I came here  for dinner.  When we had trouble finding the place (we were at the ""A Full Plate"" end of Liberties walk, we called on the phone and a nice man came out to get us and walked us over.  This, alas, was the best part of the meal.  Things got progressively worse and worse.

First we were seated (inside - at our request) and our drink order was taken by a clearly overworked, spread-too-thin male server (who was very nice and tried his best - 3 stars for him).

After taking our meal order we waited, and waited, and waited...

And waited some more...

And finally asked harried server to please bring our chips and salsa (as he had just brought some to another table nearby).  We were starvin'!

The smoky salsa and salsa verde arrive - in hot bowls ""fresh from the d/w"" and thus we had warm salsa.  Yech.  And the salty chips were ""chipettes"" (or to be mean - crumbs.)  smashed to smithereens.

OK, things aren't so great - but we await our entrees.
Wow - Impressive looking - I order a single beef shortrib and feel like Fred Flintstone.  This thing is HUGE.   Gi-normous!  Like a brontosaurus rib.  Alas - there is no sauce.  My friend orders an ""OK"" pair of Chicken burritos that are no better than Qdoba.  

So here's the kicker...  About 3/4 through the entrees, frantic server appears again with a six-pack of sauce.  He gives me a bottle of HOT and a bottle of SWEET.  I pour out a bit of the sweet onto my plate (disregarding the crust around the rim of the squeez bottle) and dip my meat in.  UGH!!!  Racidity Central.

The HOT sauce is not rancid - and has a nice flavor but it just to hot for me.

It was incredibly loud with chatter bouncing off the walls and the constant sound of metal chairs scraping across the floor as guests sat down or got up.  We could barely hear our waitress and when we left, I actually had a sore throat from having to talk so loudly over the table.  My husband got the award winning pork roll burger & duck fries and enjoyed them both.  I don't know what got into me but I went off course from ordering the same and got the sweet potato gnocchi with brown butter, roasted leeks, sage & jalapeño.  I was expecting gorgeous orange gnocchi to come out but I got a plate of gray gnocchi with no jalapeño or leeks to be found, just a greasy sauce with little pieces of charred leek residue and a ton of cracked pepper.  I really couldn't believe the dish was even served to me, it was one of the worse things I ever tasted.  I don't like to complain or make a scene so I just left the dish barely touched and moved on to dessert, which was good but not memorable.  When we left the restaurant, my husband and I had the same feedback, we'd give the Blue Duck another chance but we'd stick with what they seem to do well - burgers & fries.",2015-10-19 20:29:02,"{'food': ['pork roll burger', 'duck fries'], 'drink': []}"
