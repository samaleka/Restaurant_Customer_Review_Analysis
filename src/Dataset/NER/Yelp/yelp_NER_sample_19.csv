We were seated quickly, but no one came to take our orders for about 15 minutes. Our waiter took our food order, but we had to flag him down and ask for a drink menu afterward, and we still did not even have water at that point. Our waiter was very, very nice, but it was obvious he was overwhelmed. Our drinks did not come until well into the first course. My date took one sip of what was supposed to be a whiskey sour, and could not drink the rest. It was horrible! It didn't even taste like it had sour mix in it. We really wish we would have known they are cool with byob. 

The stand-out courses were the first with hummus and veggies, the spicy chicken and the lamb. The others were forgettable. The fruit at the end was odd. Baklava was good. 

We were seated near the door and arriving parties kept walking in, but there was no one at the door to greet them so huge groups would congregate. The lead water would come down and ask them to wait outside while they set up, but it was raining. There was an awning, but there were also a lot of people out there. Make sure you have a reservation and you make it for an early time.  

Also, our waiter said he would comp our drinks because of the wait, but they were still on the final bill.

SFZL00pbkhhn90v12abK-g,9iMbDXJomLMx-xETo720_A,Z5po0aTuzKKblek5y6Sp8Q,1,5,9,2,"Okay - so opening day of the famed 500 Degrees.  Burgers that were supposedly based on the famous Rouge burgers that can be considered one of the few shining lights in the city of Philadelphia these days.  That and our penchant for flashmobs...

I showed up to 500 Degrees with a friend at about 7:30 and was relieved to find that the line was short.  I decided to go with the #5 Combo - that being the 500 burger (cheddar cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato and their ""special"" sauce) done medium-well (Their FAVORITE), fries and my choice of soda for 9.75.  I went with root beer and truffle fries because thats how gangsters roll.

The price came to 11.07 which seemed a bit high based on the quick mental calculations of tax that my sweet brain is capable of but I didn't say anything - Indeed the cashier charged me for each item separately which ended up being more than the combo savings. An auspicious start.  My friend was overcharged too by the way - his order was the same as mine except with a milk shake.  He is not a gangster. 

So I got my root beer and my ticket and made off to an empty spot at a table.  Mind you this place is quite small for the volume of people - there is not much seating and no standing room so if you go during a busy time expect to eat it on the sidewalk while the homeless look on with jealousy fueled rage. 

I took my first sip of the root beer and realized their machine is off - it was way watered down and barely carbonated.  Hmm...getting a little concerned here.  At this point I'm thinking that this place doesn't really have its act together - which is fine for the first day being open, but if you're charging 11 bucks for a burger and fries I think everything should be spot on. 

After waiting for about 3 minutes or so our tickets get called and I grab my food and return to my table with my root beer water.  As I unwrap the burger I can see through the paper that this thing is not very big at all.  Its tall yes...but its circumfrence is about the size of a pint glass maybe. Close your eyes....visualize.....Okay let's continue.  I dig into the bag and grab truffle fries - OH YES - they're amazing just like I remember, not even a long draw from the rbw (root beer water) can drown out the immense garlicky truffly flavor of these fries.  They're awesome, gangster approved.  The fries come with 2 dipping sauces, a garlicky mayo and a smokey mayo.  Meh, other places have done dipping sauces better. 

""But Chris 500 degrees is a burger joint...What about the BURGER?!""  

An astute observation. 

This is a burger joint and inevitably must be judged on the purpose of its existence...the hamburger.   

Appearance: The bread is a nice brioche roll - it was a little dry, not the greatest but better than a generic bun.  The tomato did not look very good.  Rather old and judging by the prodding I gave it with my finger...extremely mealy.  It was not juicy and firm like a ripe tomato should be.  Disgusting.  The lettuce...well its green and not much else.  2 VERY SMALL strips of sad looking shriveled overcooked bacon sat upon a small dabbing of cheddar cheese.  The patty is quite small and very greasy looking.  It is NOT a very good looking burger under the hood. The special sauce is.....well I guess pretty special because I can't even see it.  It's not on the burger.  My friend ordered jalapenos on his burger and upon inspection the maestro crafter of artisan burgers in the kitchen thew the peppers on the burger so they were all on one side of his patty in a pile - I'd feel bad for him if he didn't look and took a bite out of that side.  Just really really sloppy amateur work.

Judging on appearance this burger is not going to be very good.  My parents told me to not be judgemental so at this point I'm still hoping that I wil be satisfied where it counts....IN MY MOUTH.  So let's have a bite...chomp

*Munch Munch Munch

Sip of RBW....

*Munch Munch

Okay.....Refund Please? 

For all the hype and the high prices and the chic atmosphere - this burger tasted as bad as it looked...actually thats not true...it didn't taste like anything.  

The bun was a little dry, tomato was very mealy and old tasting which is unforgiveable to serve in an eatery, the bacon was overcooked, I could not taste the cheese (probably because there was so little), there was no special sauce and the patty, which was meant to be cooked medium rare, was RAW.  Completely uncooked inside.  The outside was brown and thats it.  It had no salty carmelized flavor that makes a good burger.  I had to douse it in sauces just to make it edible.  

In their defense they did go around asking how everything was..I didn't say anything because I'm not confrontational...gangsters settle things with guns not words. 

I hope these shortcomings are just growing pains and 500 will eventually get its act together.  I like the idea of the place, just not their burgers.  A lot of places in philly do it better.",2010-03-24 10:56:14,"{'food': ['truffle fries'], 'drink': ['root beer']}"

As other reviewers mentioned, the chopped salad and Spanish fries are two things to definitely sample, and I would highly recommend this location for the occasional burger-craving.

A good amount of the reviews talked about the Grilled Octopus ($12) here and those folks did not lie.  That is an amazing dish.  Along with that we got a plate of Hummus and Baba Ganoush ($7.50), the Citrus Salad ($8.50), Mussels Saute ($12) and Seafood Fettuccine ($15).  This is definitely a good place to order a bunch of dishes and share.  That is exactly what this group of 3 did.

The salad came out first.  Needed more avocado, but the slices of orange and grapefruit were a nice touch. Next up the hummus and baba ganoush with bread and pita triangles.  The baba ganoush was especially good.  Might be the best I have had in a long time.

From there we went more into the entree section of our meal.  The octopus and mussels come from the ""Little Dishes"" section of their menu.  Not large, but not small by any means.  The mussels were a bit on the dry side, but that didn't seem to take away from the dish much.  The dark horse here (not really a dark horse as a few of the reviews I read highlighted this dish) was the grilled octopus.  I could eat this dish forever and ever and ever.  It is that good.  I couldn't even tell you what kind of sauce this was.  It was very light.  Possibly just some white wine and lemon and some garlic.  Nothing crazy.  Doesn't take away from the taste of what you are actually eating.  Sometimes places go crazy with their sauces and you lose all the flavor of what you are eating.  Not here.

For the main main course we had the Seafood Fettuccine.  Fettuccine in a garlic and white wine broth (I think) with mussels, clams and shrimp.  Again, very simple but oh so good.

Dmitri's seems to be a local Philadelphia chain.  There are 2 others scattered around town.  That certainly shouldn't dissuade you from coming here.  If you sit at the bar area you can watch them make the seafood right in front of you.  The action is right in front of you and the smells are just amazing.

My BF and I go to Smile Cafe way too often on Saturday night date nights so we were in the market for a new Thai place. On a recent visit my boyfriend informed me that Jasmine Rice had just opened and that it looked cute inside. OK he didn't exactly say that, but the interior designer definitely did a good job making this a cozy place. By the way, their bathroom is very clean which is always a plus. 

To start things off, we ordered our usual fav appetizer, Chao Phraya Express, which was a solid version of a summer roll. We tried Pad Khimao (Drunken Noodles) and Massaman Curry for our entrees. Boring I know, but we like to stick to the standard dishes when we're trying out a new restaurant. We both were impressed with the food here. BF said that the Pad Khimao was the best he's had yet in Philly. I thought the curry was tasty and spiced nicely. I was also impressed with the presentation.

So why the 3 stars? I admit that I had gotten used to the cheap Thai restaurants in Chicago where you could get a great plate of Pad Thai for $7. Portions at Jasmine Rice are on the smaller side, and the prices are a little bit more than I like to spend on my student budget. Additionally, the place is kinda cramped--even for a small Asian like me. Tables are stacked right next to each other, and this made the dining experience a little uncomfortable.

I guess I was hoping this would be the cheap, neighborhood Thai place. One where you could quickly stop by any day of the week and get a filling dinner.

1) THE FOOD (ESPECIALLY THE PIZZA AND PASTA) IS THE BEST EVER. AND THE DRINKS. No lie, it really is the best. Ever. If you love pizza, you need to come here. The crust is perfect- chewy and crispy at the same time, and not too charred. This pizza is so good that when my friends and I were planning a Philly pizza tasing party, I immediately called dibs on bringing In Riva pizza because I knew it would blow all other pizzas out of the water. Keep in mind: Philly has recently undergone a pizza revolution with many new worthy contenders opening up shop all over the city, so trust me when I say In Riva has the best pizza in town.

As for drinks- they used to have one called the Denali (grapefruit, sparkling wine, lemon) and I was obsessed with it. Once they changed their menu around, I was hesitant to try the new items, but one of the servers recommended the Lietti (vodka, mint, lemon). Now it is my new obsession and I have at least 2 every time I come. So good!

2)  THE SERVICE IS ALWAYS ON POINT. I believe I am qualified to speak on this matter because I have been here an embarrassing number of times. Not once have I ever felt rushed or forgotten. I have been coming here since it opened back in 2012, and many of the employees who started with the restaurant are still there today. I think that speaks volumes about the type of establishment In Riva is.

3) THE LOCATION IS WORTH THE TRECK. Being in East Falls, it seems that a lot of people believe this place is a bit off the beaten path. But let me tell you- the view alone makes the trip worth it. I actually live over the bridge in NJ, and I take the train into center city and ride my bike down Kelly Drive to get here. I do drive here quite often too, and the best part about that is I can bring my dog and sit in the Pizza n Pups section. It is pretty convenient when I am coming back from a disc golf trip with my dog and don't know where to go to get some food.

PZNl-KxLE4QBDUDNEf7r6Q,SIF4p7FyhhoW4Y0pS9Lk7g,htO_nlxkEsYHzDrtbiUxew,1,22,5,5,"Full disclosure: I am from Philadelphia.  I have worked at many different coffee shops that all came from different traditions.  And as you will see if you read my review I don't like La Colombe.  My reason's are not based on grudges and I'm not trying to destroy their business.  I even include some source material in this review.  I dare other yelpers to do the same.  I hope you find my review helpful.  I also encourage people who like coffee to embrace it fully.  Coffee has seemed snobby in the past, but I assure you good coffee isn't.  Look at where the product's coming from: ""3rd-world"" nations that are typically in civil unrest and usually have to deal with very extreme natural forces (volcanos!).  These farmers are not exactly members of the financial elite.
here goes:

So, I'm a Philadelphian... I was born here... educated here... I grew up in the cafe culture that it has... La Colombe used to rock my world with some milk and sugar.  Then, I went to Portland to visit some family and accidentally discovered Stumptown coffee and my eyes have forever since seen the light.  After a week in Portland, I came back to La Colombe super stoked for espresso.  I noticed the difference immediately.

Here's the deal, La Colombe jumped onto the early 90's coffee band wagon and made an acceptable product for the times.  They were successful in a town that never really had much to claim for coffee, as opposed to the NW, Italy, or the Nordic regions.  Being successful, they never bothered to continue and progress or refine they're product.  Nor their barista's training, which after the farmer and roaster is the last platform in pulling off noticeably incredible coffee.

A lot has happened over the last decades, in coffee.  Todd Carmichael, one of the owners, has been too distracted (crossing the South Pole) and too lazy (http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/worst-coffee-trends-060210) to take heed or notice.

And it's easy  to see the latter when you a) check out the coffee, which is bad tasting b) check out the machinery which in my years frequenting his store has NEVER BEEN CLEANED (milk encrusted steam wands) and c) has non-transparent coffee... that is that who knows where the coffee's coming from... which is deceptive and typically a hint that the coffee is grown unethically and crappy.

But hey, the proof is in the pudding.  I encourage all who will read this to check out their website (which mentions coffee that tastes like ""exclusive"" ..?.. not cocoa or berries or ...ya know, real food); check out their coffee and espresso; does it have a roast date listed? Coffee has a short sweet spot after being roasted... less than a few weeks; are their beans really oily (proof of over-roasting or being too old); see how bad and unsympathetic their baristas are.  Then go to a shop like Ultimo, Spruce Street Espresso, Bodhi, or Capogiro and notice the difference.  The craziest part about the last referenced cafe is that they use La Colombe beans and due to their care for details actually pull a half decent shot of their espresso, despite the odds.

When you care about how a crop is farmed, how it is roasted, and how it is prepared, the product usually tastes better (coors light or yards?).  Also, pretension doesn't equal good product and the great cafes mentioned above don't mix the two.

I also encourage La Colombe to do a better job and give a crap about what they do and serve.  But with owners that are this out of touch and nihilistic, I don't see that happening.  For an interesting critique on Todd Carmichael's bogus article check out Chris Tacey's review.  It's interesting.  http://godshot.blogspot.com/2010/06/thank-you-sir-may-i-have-another.html

I guess everything to be said about Honey's has been said - but that doesn't make it any less true or amazing.  

My roommate & I came at a very peak hour - about 12:30 on Sunday. We were told the wait would be about an hour for a party of 4, 45 min for a party of 2. That was a clear overestimate, we waited maybe 20 min for our party of 2 (the time scared our other two friends off, serious loss on their part!)
I love a restaurant that has options like ""Vegetarian Chicken Fried Steak"" on the menu. It's very thoughtful. Roomie had an omelet with spinach, salsa & cheddar w/ turkey bacon, toast & latke, plus OJ. I had the ""Big Bowl o' Miso Soup"" and pancakes with banana and almond with coffee. That soup was so good I wanted to cry. I honestly had to ask Kyleen to pull it away from me so I didn't tilt the bowl to my face & drink the last of it. Pancakes were great, fluffy golden & perfect - none of that banana goo crap you get at iHop. The coffee wasn't amazing, but free refills are good. Ky gushed over the bacon & omelet, completely devoured her toast. I stole a few bites of her latke (yummy: crispy &  perfectly seasoned) and had some of her orange juice. I am weird and picky about orange juice, so I'll keep my analysis of it short: every good day should start with a glass of that liquid amazing. I even watched them make it with the cool retro machine, and swear it is bewitched. There is something unearthly wonderful in that stuff, and no one will convince me otherwise. 
Our bill came to $30 for very healthy servings (we both took boxes). We were a lil' jealous of the girls who thought to bring champagne for mimosas. I will certainly be back, alcohol in tow, with my eye on that veggie chicken steak.

I've only been to Federal Donuts ONCE yet have already had THREE separate whimsical reveries concerning these exquisite ""holes-in-one"".

Oh, shit.

The ""hot donuts"" may, in fact, be habit-forming - made to order & handed to you warm, soft and with that perfect melt-in-your-mouth consistency. The aroma alone is enough to put you into a state of prolonged food coma.

I eagerly devoured crystal-covered vanilla lavender and indian spice rings of heaven. Both were absolutely divine (although I liked the vanilla lavender just a PINCH better).

The ""fancy donuts"" (which are pre-made yet still out of this world), are flawlessly decorated and presented in various exotic flavors including chocolate spicy peanut, passionfruit poppy, apple-cinnamon walnut, grapefruit brown sugar, caramel-banana etc etc. I sampled the grapefruit brown sugar which had a very unique flavor - much fruitier than I expected. I also tasted the more ""traditional"" apple-cinnamon-walnut variety which was the consummate combination of sweet and fruity & generously topped with apple crumbles.

These alongside my freshly-brewed cup of green tea made for quite the breakfast of champions.

I can hardly wait to venture back to try the newly-added chicken wings option (the 5PM weekend timeslot will finally make this possible!).

I took my 2 coworkers for a second time, hoping it would be as good as people had been saying, and that our first trip was just an odd ball. 

So we got a different person waiting our table this time. The food was cooked right, not crispy burned like last time. However the burgers were mediocre at best, not something you would expect from $13-$15 burgers. I'd still  rather go go Smash Burger or Shakeshack for better quality and cheaper price. I still would've given them a 3 star review if it wasn't for the service. Oh my the service!!!

They had the MOST HORRIBLE service I've ever seen in any restaurant, low or high end. I gave this place a one-star partly because of the terrible service we received. We thought it wouldn't get any worse this time around. Oh I was dead wrong!!! After we finished our food, the waiter picked up our plates and disappeared for a good 30 mins. We got really impatient since we had to go back to work. You would think where this place is located at, they should expect lots of office people out for lunch, no one would want to sit and wait around half an hour for the check. 

And that's not it. I showed the waiter the gift card I was sent to use for this trip. He said he couldn't scan it since he had never done it before and had to call his manager. It took another 15 minutes for someone else to stop by and look at our gift card. Now the gift card said to use I just had to show them the QR code to scan so that's what I did. This guy proceeded to tell us that it wouldn't work because I had to download and app and create a Bareburger account for it to work. I had to sit there and argue with him that it wasn't what was stated on the gift card and I didn't have time to go through all that crap after 45 minutes of waiting already. He then came to a realization that it was a gift card I got from Yelp review. And that was when he started to show his attitude. We gave him the change to cover the tip and he wouldn't look nor say anything to us.

All and all, after mediocre food and horrible customer service, it took us an hour and a half for our lunch, granted it was only a block away from our office.

What actually happened was something different.  When you first walk into the space it looks pretty cool.  You get closer to the counter and the baristas are spot on friendly and make you feel welcome.  I see the two big espresso makers behind the counter, they look convincingly cool.  I get my cafe mocha in a ceramic mug since I'm planning on grabbing a table and being respectful of the planet.

We eye an empty table and snag it. I look down at my mug and the coffee looks good, a nice finishing touch with the froth. I sip my drink expecting that moment of it's going to be pretty hot, but it's going to be drinkable.  Well...turns out my coffee was not very hot at all, it was a little warmer than room temperature.  That was the first let down.  Then I take another sip, where's the mocha flavor?  The mocha is TOTALLY lacking, almost no sweetness at all to my drink.  When I order from of my usual coffee joints I usually ask for half the amount of mocha.  I don't seek out mocha because I want a drinkable candy bar so it's not that I love it overly sweet.  I just like a hint of mocha, yet this drink, no hint.  In fact you could have told me I was drinking a cappuccino and I would have said you were right.  Big time fail on the cafe mocha guys.  

So, as I am complaining about my drink to my wife I am also noticing the decor.  The incredibly half ass ""faux painting\finishing"" on the walls.  Seriously. can you please put some money and imagination into what your coffee joint is going to look like.  Sorry, but besides very good customer service this place failed miserably.  One last good thing, the price was very reasonable.  Then again, bland, semi-warm coffee doesn't deserve a high price tag.

pKWilTuGoUUIyiBewJxHWQ,kuhYz6erOHGKazHex8_KCQ,_9x1oSQghxEPuUeb5NPShw,3,2,1,1,"I recently went to this restaurant with a good friend who wanted to have Moroccan food. She had it before in Morocco and wanted to see what this restaurant was like. 

This place is right off of South street, which made for some difficulty parking. However, we decided on a late dinner at 7:15pm or so, and so got lucky with close parking spots. The service was super duper friendly, although not extremely fast. This did not really bother us as I get the impression that Moroccan culture makes a meal a slow experience in itself. Although we found out later that all our servers and even the owner were not Moroccan. However, do not worry, the chef is (and is not that the most important part? hahaha). 

We had coupons so we had to order the Fez Feast (7 courses). We started out with a trio of cold salads. They were all very good. There was a cucumber salad, a carrot salad and eggplant concoction. This was served with all you can eat warm bread, which was delicious. The servers bring by the bread in this gigantic woven basket; I felt a bit bad on how often I asked them to bring us bread, but it really was delicious. Then we had a puff pastry with a meat like mixture. I have to admit neither I nor my companion really cared for this. The dish was sprinkled with powdered sugar, and meat and powdered sugar just did not work for me. 

We both had the olive lemon chicken (I think you had a choice of several different types of chicken, but it was hard to understand the server). The chicken was fairly tender, but the dish overall was too salty for me. The server asked if we would like it mild or spicy and we decided on mild. However, he made the ingenious suggestion of getting the spices on the side so we could at least try it. The server informed me that there was harissa in the spices, which is an ingredient I have been dying to try. The spices ended up being too spicy for me, but I was really glad to have gotten the chance to try the harissa, and the flavor was quite good. 

The fourth course was a choice between beef kabobs and honey almond lamb. My companion and I ended up split over this choice; she got the kabobs and I got the lamb. She was generous enough to allow me to try her kabob, which consisted of green peppers, onions (I think) and 3 chunks of beef. I did not really think it was anything special. It did not really seem specially seasoned or flavored. The lamb, however, was quite tasty. I was a little disappointed as the lamb was not super tender and the honey taste did not seem really infused into the meat. But overall, it was a pretty tasty dish. I had this same (I believe) dish YEARS ago after finishing my first year of undergraduate education. I remembered it being amazing. Of course that was years ago, and memories get warped throughout the years. So I liked this dish but was a bit disappointed because it did not live up to the memories. 

The fifth dish was a couscous with roasted vegetables. There is not much to say. It was okay, a bit bland, but okay. I know my companion thought it was a bit too dry. There were a lot of good vegetables in there, however. 

I am not sure how they counted the last few courses. There was fruit that was brought to us in a basket. A generous 6 pieces; two each of apples, bananas and oranges. It does not sound like much, but considering how much food preceded this, we were full just looking at the fruit. There was also a very, very delicious cup of sweetened mint tea. This was followed by an eclair looking pastry. I found the pastry to be a great light and sweet ending to the meal. 

My biggest complaint and word of caution is that later at night it seems like a lot of customers come for the hookah. Since I am allergic to smoke and the dining area is one big long room with nowhere to hide, this was a problem. I would say, if you think that the hookah will bother you to come earlier in the evening. When we first got to the restaurant, there was traditional Moroccan sounding music playing, later when the hookah customers came, the music all of a sudden changed to a disco-techy musical selection. I guess they think hookah goes better with disco-techy music.

The sign says ""Blue Duck"" in large letters; plenty of free parking in the strip center; and a bit more space inside than you'd anticipate from the small front; but, still, only seating for 40 or so.  There's a bench outside and by 6:30pm it's got occupants waiting for a coveted seat so, take heed, and make a reservation.  The popularity of this place is only going to grow as word gets out even further -- this is a long awaited oasis in a culinary wasteland. (Except for a few great, authentic Russian, Portugese and other international cuisines.)  

Only 8 tables (one long one for larger groups of 10 or as communal table if no group reserves it, and several 4 and 6-seaters), plus maybe 10 or so seats at a counter facing the busy open kitchen. (Tables are well-spaced, but there's enough open space to fit another small table or two without crowding.)  Pleasant servers all around, anyone will help out any request from any guest and the general manager will stop by to see if you are happy.  I suggested they upgrade their soft drink offerings to be as creative as their food; GM agreed. For now, coke and diet coke in cute sized glass bottles. And BYO.  I LOVE the hours -- brunch daily, essentially, serving Tue-Sun 10am-4pm.  Then, without break, (just a menu shift), Dinner begins at 4 'til 10pm T-Sat. (Closed Sun night and all day Monday.)  Perhaps your best spontaneous shot at a table may be to go at an odd meal time like 11am, 2:30p, or 4pm?  We finagled a seat without a reservation from a hesitant hostess, but assured, if the kitchen kept up, we'd be out in an hour and, gee, we'd come so far and there were NO other options for our ruined center-city sensibilities.  (Stopped by after an event at Fox Chase Farm, a few miles west.)

Quiet enough for conversation when we arrived at 5:30pm to a less than half full restaurant, but an hour later we could not hear each other, nor could the waiter hear us, as the full, loud din of the hard surfaces and chatting diners took over.  When the sun went down, the natural dimming was suddenly rendered too dark by an abrupt lowering of the lights, as well.  The giant tv, hung toward the back, behind those dining at the counter, so not sure who is best positioned to see this unnecessary visual clutter.  (But useful if an important game is on and you must watch it while eating something really delicious.)

Menu offers a namesake Duck Sandwich and gourmet burgers, gourmet mac n cheese (with smoked bacon or duck, and panko in large soup-bowl serving; various spicy wings, tacos, fries or croquettes; but also more serious offerings like a changing fish dish, (they were out of fresh pasta bolognese), and there may be a risotto and fiddlehead ferns.  There's a specials menu, and one of my dining companions ordered the filet which came perfectly pink, slathered in a sauce that seemed a little odd to her (and her foodie son, who sampled a bite) but she finished it all, leaving half the hearty grits, and enjoyed her multicolored uncut, stem and all, carrots that added a fun rustic-ness to the plate.  I was intent to try the enticing sounding Quack and Cheese, which came with small macaroni with creamy gouda sauce and crunch duck-fatted panko, with shreds and small chunks of duck and a good handful of dried cherries.  I really liked it, but traded it half way through for a fellow diner's classic mac n cheese with delectable chunks of smoked bacon.  We  couldn't decide which we liked better, both were great.  The servings were large enough to share, esp as appetizer or side, though you may not want to.  For balance I had the tuna tartar appetizer which I loved; subtly spicy and festooned with edible flowers and little stalks of lavender.  (This may change, but it gives an idea of creativity and great execution.)  Our third dining companion had the meatloaf, a thick slab, wrapped in bacon, with accompanying mashed potatoes.

The three of us shared two desserts -- the classic cheesecake, with a delectably chewy graham crust, which we loved and devoured.  The Guiness chocolate cake was a bit dry (so we paired with bites of the very moist cheesecake).  It would be great if they followed another 21st century dining accommodation and provided more wheat-free options, including a dessert. Drop the Guiness cake and replace with flourless chocolate.

Wish they'd update their website menu, daily if needed, so you know the true current menu -- but they say they keep their other social media updated so I'll check twitter and Facebook.

Chances are they're closed.  That's what happened to me late one Sunday after working on cars all day at my friend's garage.  We thought it would be simple, those backlit yellow and red letter signs never go off.  The shining beacon in the urban night sky for wontons, dutchies, and chips.  Nope.

In fact, I had lived about two miles away when I first realized this.  So I made that two mile drive every time I wanted Chinese take-out in the final hours of the day.  One thing I should mention is that they do achieve wok hei, at least with the fried rice.  Wok hei, or ""breath of the wok"", is that sort of smokey burning flavor attained only from very high heat and the carbon steel of a wok.

We went to DiNardo's for dinner on a Thursday. I wasn't too keen on the idea because it's generally not a great value. I'm not opposed to spending a decent amount of money to have a great meal, but I hate feeling like I'm getting hosed. 

Anyway. We arrived and were seated quickly without a reservation, which was nice. We ordered our drinks and apps. We'd wanted to get the Cajun shrimp app and the cocktail claws from the raw bar. Sadly, they were out of the crab claws so we got the Littleneck steamers. Both the shrimp and the clams were good.

The decor is dated, but in a charming way. My date got a blackened shrimp entree, which he enjoyed and I got the crab stuffed broiled flounder filet, which I did not. To be honest, it tasted like the stuffed tilapia you get at the grocery store when you're too lazy to make real food. It just wasn't good eating. 

I usually get snow crab by the pound, but the market price was about $40/lb, which is a bit high considering that I can get the same for $8/lb. I understand food cost, but 5x retail for steaming crab seems silly.

My last issue was with the drinks. I ordered two drinks, both Jameson on the rocks with ginger ale. I only received one and was charged for both. (Though they did take the unreceived drink off the bill). I was honestly shocked by the price of my drink. 12.50. Are you kidding me? I'm a bartender (in Old City) and that's a legitimately obscene price for a simple rocks drink. $10-11, I could even see but this is just a case of a place that has substandard food that charges a premium for it.

It's mostly philly junkfood, prepared as a similarly salty, greasy  substitute meat version of the same stuff you can get on any corner.  So if you skip the burger and cheesesteak joints  simply because you don't want to eat animals, you might love this restaurant, but if you choose a plant based diet for a healthier lifestyle than you probably won't find most of this menu to be a good fit...unless you're seeking the occasional grease fix.",2012-08-21 15:12:35,"{'food': ['burger', 'cheesesteak'], 'drink': []}"

-Calamari: Would not order this or recommend it. Very bland. Marinara was weak sauce (pun intended). 
-Margherita Pizza: In the words of my husband ""Garlicy and cheesy - this is the best kind of pizza!"" Very delicious. Highly recommended. They do offer gluten free crust but were out of it last night when I went. Can't wait to order that next time as I do like Gluten Free options. 
-Banana Cream Pie: Exquisite.  Best I've ever had. The chocolate crust was perfect!

After the appetizer we ordered two pizzas: Bianca Verde and Sausage and Peppers. The BV pizza is a staple for us. Lots of garlic and olive oil, and plenty of goat cheese spread within. The S&P was a surprise favorite. Think the traditional ""supreme"" style pizza with LOTS of flavor, a little heat, and no olives/mushrooms.

Both times I got the Chicken Salad bowl.  It was good.  The garlic sauce is delicious.  And the side pita is fantastic.  

What I will say may even prevent me from coming back are 2 things:
1.) The staff:  Don't get me wrong, some are vey nice.  The guy making the pitas was friendly and worked hard.  The guy at the register was HORRIBLE.  He was not friendly.  He just rang you up and threw the pita in the bag and that was it.  He didnt ask, if I wanted a drink or anything else, just $10.89. He also said to a co-worker while I was waiting for my receipt to print ""yo, I gotta wiz.""  The co-worker said - ""You have to go to the bathroom?""

2.) HAIR NETS:  Several of the women did not have their hair pulled back and were reaching over the food area with their hair just ready to fall into the food.  I think that it should be required that their hair is either pulled back AND OR in a hair net.  That is very unsanitary.

In my opinion, it offers the best valued Ethiopian food in the Philly area, a place where competition is steep.  The food here is a good $2 or so per item cheaper than in most restaurants, and the service I have found is consistently better than average.  The quality of the food does not at all suffer from the lower price--instead, you just give up the fancy atmosphere, and that's cool with me.

This place is a little divey, in a 70's cafeteria sort of way.  There's an eating area on one side, seat yourself, and a bar on the other.  The bar is dark and the seating area is brighter, but not exactly the most brightly lit place.

But I like it.  There's a positive vibe in here.  They're often playing energetic hip-hop music.  It's the sort of place that I feel very comfortable, and I'm not quite sure why.

But I always like the food, especially the vegetarian food.  I especially like the Foul and Vegetarian platter here.  Food is cheap, portions are good, quality is consistently good, service is consistently good.

dv1BumOXtIbD_2aZpwn9Yw,YbCkQ5z_hD2OdsIPllaJTA,mUIBtlWNPD7sz3rGGWQ1RA,3,0,0,1,"after hearing many great things about the restaurant, i tried kanella this past Friday for the first time.  it took some time for my party of four to get our plan together, so we ended up making a reservation for 9:45p.  Upon arrival, we had a short wait; I noticed that there were two walk-in parties that had to be turned away, so i would definitely recommend making a reservation.

i think one of the reasons i've yet to try kanella is because of the menu -- very meat heavy.  so we all decided to just try all of the appetizers and make it a tapas night.  

to start things off, our server was passionate and patient in describing the items on the menu.

as michelle c. mentioned, the dips of the day possess a pungent garlic taste.  also, the chef did not go easy on the lemon either.  but, i think you've got to try the dips of the day if you go to kanella.

the dolmades were on the bland side, but i enjoyed the accompanying cabbage salad.

i was not quick enough to sample the bureki, so i cannot comment on that.  i did, however, snag a roasted beet and it was really tender and tasty.

i was a big fan of the fried halloumi cheese.  granted, it seemed to be drenched in lemon, but paired with my sauvignon blanc, the two flavors balanced each other out.  so, i enjoyed the dish.

the cod fish and chips were just too salty for my taste.  mr. h, however, said his portion was seasoned just fine, but then he had a bite of mine that he could not finish because of the sodium.  absent the salt issue, i really would have enjoyed the appetizer.

i didn't love the calamari, but that's because i tend to like my calamari battered and fried.  that's just me.

also, i didn't love the cyprus sausage.  it was kind of a loose sausage.  so, it was a bit weird for me.

i think my favorite appetizer was the koubes, which is bulgar wheat stuffed with spiced ground lamb and pine nuts served with tzaziki.  i am not even a huge lamb fan and this item was very pleasing to me.  

overall, kanella it is not what i would consider destination dining. it is a fine byob to go to with friends or during the week if you just want a decent meal or new place to try.  i can't say it would be a great romantic spot on the weekend because it was very noisy inside.  

i might try kanella again to try the whole fish.  our server informed us that they will fillet the whole fish for you tableside, which is nice, because i don't even know where to begin with a whole fish.",2010-03-28 15:58:12,"{'food': ['dolmades', 'fried halloumi cheese', 'koubes'], 'drink': []}"

I ordered to take out, the black garlic wings, the miso Ramen for myself and the Brisket for my husband. 

So I'm quite certain that the review would warrant 4-5 stars if we dined in. 

But we didn't and this is how the meal went down. 

The wings fresh out of the kitchen I'm sure are crispy-crunchy perfect. After sitting in a to-go container for 15 min before I got there; they couldn't help but be soggy. But they're so good that it didn't matter. I'll definitely be ordering them again.

My ramen was tasty. The noodles are chewy, and have a perfect bite to them. The miso broth wasn't my favorite. It was mellow, the pork shoulder was melt in your mouth tender; the flavor was very subtle. Combined I feel as though it was all just very subdued, but nice- flavors.

I'm more likely to go back to try the dumplings and some other items off the menu.

The experience started off innocently enough. We walked in and nearly all of the 1st floor seating was taken. It was mostly business folks, but there was one other family there. The menu was short, but the options appeared interesting. The waitress was pleasant.

My wife ordered the Red Owl omelet with orange juice and I the sweet potato pancakes with coffee. My son opted for milk and toast. The OJ and coffee arrived. The OJ was very good according to my wife, but the coffee was pretty much institutional coffee. 

When the meals arrived, the size of the entries was good. This pretty much ends the ""good"" of our visit here. The omelet was according to my wife, tasteless. The sweet potato pancakes on the other hand were not pleasant tasting and very dry. They had some sort of butter on top that tasted good, but there was not nearly enough to cancel out the taste of the pancakes.

There were another flight of stairs going down on the right, and a set of stairs on both sides going up, the left side was roped off, on the right the stairs led to a wall, I can't help but wonder what this building was originally intended, and after so many years came up with the current layout, but I love these old buildings.

It was decided that Marrakesh would be the dinner spot. I came with no preconceptions about the place. Just and open mind and an empty stomach, ready to be enticed and to eat. 

Now, I'm from NYC and have seen my fair share of seedy places and back alleys. While this place doesn't rank amongst the top on my list of ""places I'd love not to walk alone again,"" it is pretty unnerving to walk this narrow alley after dark. I'd suggest to always have a burly guy with you just to be safe. 

Once inside I already heard the loud music of Middle Eastern music playing and we walked in right in the middle of a belly dancing routine in progress. The girl was missing a tooth but nonetheless, still a very sexy dancer if you didn't look her straight in the face. 

We were ushered up a set of narrow stairs to the 2nd level, past what MUST have been a stripper pole in its former life to a teeny, weeny room with no ventilation where everyone  is seated on top of each other. They called this ""cozy."" We called it ""sweaty.""

Anyhow, we crowded around a small table and readied ourselves for a Morrocan feast. I have to say the food surpassed my expectations. Excellent flavors, seasonings and spices. We started with 2 appetizers which were eaten with pita bread. Be prepared as 90% of the meal is really eaten with your hands. The phyllo dough sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon stuffed with the chicken bits and eggs was absolutely delish. I wanted to devour that all by myself but we were like 8 hungry beasts going at it. The chicken course was soo tender and juicy. I finally fulfilled my fantasy of ripping off a chicken leg and eating it cavewoman style. Turns out that it's much less sexier than I expected. 

They had run out of the beef shishkabobs (bummer) and we passed on the lamb so I can't comment on the dish. But the other party we were sitting on top of must have gotten the last beef kabobs and the smell of it almost made me want to do viscous things to them just for a taste. Everything else that followed was pretty forgettable. The meal steadily declined after the chicken. 

Overall I think it's worthy of a try. It was my first time eating with my bare hands at a semi civilized restaurant. We were very close to each other which created a very intimate, friendly atmosphere. It's for the family, for friends and definitely good for a date. 

The service was really excellent and attentive. They felt bad that we didn't get to try the kabobs and served us great wine compliments of the house.

If you decide you want to move forward with the cake there, the $45 will be deducted IF you spend over $750. After that initial email, I emailed 3 times and left a voicemail and called again before I finally was able to reach Ally via phone to get a date scheduled for my tasting. When I explained who I was and that I had been trying to reach out to book a date, she responded that since my wedding was so far away (it was a year in advance) that she didn't feel the need to rush. I was put off by her unapologetic response about getting back to me, but I pushed it off and went ahead and booked a date in April for my tasting. Three days before my tasting, I received an email from Ally saying that they have to reschedule my tasting, with no reasoning as to why. At that point, it was the last straw and I emailed her back right away explaining that it was a hassle to even get this appointment booked, and that I would like my money back. Again, no response from Ally...

The next day, I called the bakery and spoke to Ally. I explained that I would like my money back and that this is not the place I want my wedding cake from. I understand things come up, but a phone call explaining the situation would have been the right thing to do. Because I didn't get that, I can only assume that they needed to move my appointment to have a tasting for someone that was last minute. Why should my schedule change because I plan ahead?

I enjoyed the latka side, served with apple sauce and sour cream, which was crunchy and flavorful.

MexiCali has a modest menu. They offer burritos, nachos, enchiladas, tacos, and each item is customizable to taste. The portions are okay, but considering the prices, I expect a bit more. Their meat dishes could use a bit more seasoning on the carne. Otherwise, the food is alright, but there is certainly much better out there (El Azteca near Jefferson Hospital is a personal favorite).

The baker said she was ""sorry"" if ""I misunderstood""and just repeated herself that this was their policy and the item would have to be paid in full or else no cake. Who is going to give you $112 for free and not pick up a confirmed cake??!! I canceled the order right away.

I like that is casual and has excelent food. The service is mostly quick. They want to get the food hot to your table. This is our must tries for you:

For a starter we get the chopped salad. It is filled with assorted meats and chesses. It is light and doesnt fill you up too much. Besides, I try to save room for my main course.

Our second course is the famous stromboli. You can fill it with an assortment of delicious toppings. We enjoy just having pepperoni. For a heads up the basic stromboli for them is filled with chesse, sweet peppers, onions, and tomato sauce. It is awesome and very delicious.

If we save room, most of the time we will get a canoli that they make homemade. It is sweet and what a traditional canoli should be. 

If you notice, they give you a basket of bread. It has this olive oil and balsomic mixture on the side

It's always so awesome to see a hometown kid make good.  And good indeed,  humble Kevin Sbraga is one of our own, and after garnering fame and the top spot on Top Chef, he came back and gifted us with his namesake, casual, nouveau Américain restaurant with an approachable and delicious menu and amazing wine selections situated on the corner first floor, uber-visible lot at the Symphony House.  (aside: Jen Carroll, what are you waiting for?)

The interior is cool and elegant - with reclaimed accent wood walls and white marble bar countertops and cozy seating - and the voyeur in me always digs an open kitchen, too. Love!  

Service is affable, friendly, generous - from the hostess, servers, to the bartenders are smiling, energetic - even the maître d' -  is there to check in on you -  Their sommelier is engaging, knowledgeable and shared a wealth of information over a particular bottle we enjoyed (and ended up buying a couple for holiday gifts - thank you for the recommendation!)  It's refreshing to go into an establishment and encounter a staff that is engaged and exciting - it always elevates the entire experience.

Their four course tasting menu and beverage pairings is definitely the way to go - (although, don't let me deter you from the chef tasting menu either, a journey unto itself) and from their delicious cocktails, gruyère and truffle(!) popovers, foie gras soup (!), to their black cod and spicy kimchee, meatloaf with bacon marmalade,  and finishing off with a mascarpone, coffee granita and chocolate dessert, aside from my favorites, there is not one menu item that I wouldn't devour and rejoice at every bite.

There is  never a bad time to go to Tria.  Their ever-evolving wine list always features a wide enough selection to suit anyone in any mood, whether you want a cozy, familiar Cali Pinot Noir, or something adventurous from South Africa with powerful bell pepper tones.  They also have some of the most spot-on descriptions of wine I have ever encountered.  The beer selection is similarly impressive.

By now, I have sampled nearly everything on their food menu.  It has been universally excellent.  The small plates and bruschetta provide delightful treats when you don't want to commit to real food.  The salads are generous servings for one person and loaded with goodies.  The paninis each come with a little salad and are easily enough to share between two people.  And the cheese - Oh, the cheese!  Again, great selections always paired with a little something to set off the flavor (think fig and dark chocolate jam with a Stilton, or chili-infused honey with Ponte Nova).

The only possible con is the fact that it is WAY too easy to spend money here, but it need not be so.  The food prices are very reasonable, as are most beers.  The price can start to run up with the wines, which average around $10 per glass.  One could limit one's self to a glass or two, or switch over to beer.  I have not been able to use either strategy myself, but I think that is a personal problem between me and wine.  I am willing to pay for excellent wine served to me in a lovely atmosphere by pleasant and knowledgeable staff.

Beautifully ornate rugs, padded chairs, colorful wall hangings, sweet shisha smoke hanging in the air, delicious smells wafting from the kitchen, and a hip, diverse crowd in deep states of chillness and relaxation. It is an unpretentious, thoroughly warm and welcoming oasis from the madness of Old City.

I had two great friends visiting me in Philly for a weekend. After a nice day of walking around the city and checking out the Mütter Museum, we decided to take a breather with a movie at the Ritz and then have a late dinner. Around 6:45, I called Ariana to ask if they took reservations. They did! And yes, they could seat the three of us at 9pm on a Saturday. Score!

It was an easy walk from Ritz at the Bourse. We walked in and were welcomed by a lovely, smiling woman who, it turned out, would also be our waitress for the evening. Our table was spacious and comfortable (those padded, upholstered chairs!) and we could tell right away this would be a great place to while away the evening.

One of my friends had the pulao with chicken, which turned out to be this intoxicating blend of sweet, acidic, proteiny and savory. It was excellent. My other friend had a chicken kabob and was very happy with that. I had a dish of split-pea daal topped with lamb stew. It was incredible, and the quality of the lamb was top-notch. Oh, I almost forget that we also split several appetizers, different varieties of dumplings, and those were extremely good, as well. My favorite was filled with fresh chives.

Afterwards, we smoked a hookah. The hookah pipes are attractive and clean, and there was a ton of shisha in there. We ordered a second coal but we finally had to end up leaving unsmoked shisha because we were all starting to feel a little light-headed! The shisha was good-quality and delicious. I should also say that the air had the light smell of sweet smoke, just enough to be atmospheric and pleasant, but Ariana's must have a very good ventilation system because even with a hookah on practically every table, it was never oppressively smoky or remotely close.

The crowd was great. It was diverse--mostly Black and Brown with a few White people--and very chill and friendly. Everyone was happy and having a good time. Ariana is BYOB, so some people brought wine. One table made the power move of bringing a bottle of Jameson along!

When we finally left, our waitress smiled broadly and wished us a good night and told us to come back some time. The service was friendly and warm, from beginning to end.

The next day, my friends were still raving about Ariana, so this is definitely a keeper for entertaining out-of-town guests. But for us Philly folks, there is no reason not to make Ariana a regular stop.

This really should be a 4.5 star review - the two times that I've been to MIx have been nearly perfect, with only minor little things that I haven't liked. The first time, I was not a fan of their salad. Yes, I know it's a sushi joint salad, but they absolutely DROWNED the poor pieces of lettuce in this incredibly overpowering ginger dressing. I took one tiny bite and had to push it away. During the second visit, we tried the spring roll appetizer, but I was not a fan of the sauce that came with it - it almost tasted like ketchup. Not great with the rolls.

The sushi is fantastic. There really isn't too much more to say about that. This last time that I was there, I was with someone who had never  honestly eaten ""real"" sushi before....he was a california roll kind of guy.

The place is faux New England(ish?). The prices are stupid, like, ridiculously stupid. 35.00 for tuna (?) covered in what they said was crab, still not sure about that one.

This place is the real deal and then some. After missing our original movie time CB and i were famished and in need of a place that was open for lunch and close to /in Nolibs. After a combination of yelping and groupon nowing we decided on Las Cazuelas. We walked in and the place was empty as in the kitchen staff , hostess and waitress were all standing around not usually a good sign but we went with it. After seating us at a table the hostess/waitress offered up bevs since we did not want to imbibe before the film we went with mexican sodas pina for me and orange for CB. Chips and salsa arrived at the table and the salsa had a surprising sweet flavor but it was cold (weird) but still tasty. We started with the fundidio which comes with your choice of mushrooms, chorizo or poblano peppers. We opted for the peppers. The fundido was perfect the peppers added a little kick and the cheese was stringy greasy perfection. My only gripe was we only got 3 flour tortillas so its a good thing we still had plenty of chips left or all that fundido would have been wasted. I couldn't decide if i wanted 2 or 3 tacos and at 2.75 each ( A STEAL ) i got 3 shrimp tacos authentic w/ cilantro and onions. I expected nothing like what i received. 3 huge shrimp tacos each holding 3 GIANT shrimp and just a sprinkling of onions the perfect ratio. the shrimp were cooked amazingly well and were seasoned with a slight spice YUM. CB tried each of the chicken taco options and one shrimp he enjoyed them all very much. Since they offered dessert and I'm a sucker for sweet things we split the tres leches cake which was very moist and creamy. I wrapped up my lunch with a mexican coffee hot and sweet with just a little punch. Our service was great and towards the end of lunch more tables arrived.
This restaurant is a little on the small side (downstairs has less than 6 tables I'm sure it would be great for groups though) Id say come here for a start to your friday night since its a BYOT and a BYOB .

All of the forces of chaos combined, have kept me from trying out the best new eatery in Philly but recently, they became confused on the way to my house and I was able to slip through, like just about any Running Back through the Eagles soft defense.

I had heard the horror stories, of how the clamoring masses have stacked body upon body, in their attempts at getting themselves a shiny donut or chicken part. I'm not good in crowds so I tried to time my arrival accordingly(around 10:30am). SUBURBAN COMMUTER NOTE: I parked on the far side of Washington, thinking there would be no space available, but upon my trek over, noticed ample spots, just a block away.

Upon my arrival, there was already a small group present. Those last vestiges of the morning rush combined with the early chicken go getters and I , in my arrogance, considered myself an equal member of both camps. I immediately took in the familiar and inviting faces of Blake and Felicia. They were busy but I couldn't help but think that they considered this their "" down time"". 

Here's the part of every one of my reviews, where I make an ass of myself. I was invited to take a seat at the counter. When I got there, there was counter space but no seat. I stood (happily) and watched the goings on. After a few minutes, Felicia came out to gently explain to me that the stools pull out and she"" pulled out my stool "" (sorry). You'd think someone who grew up with transformers would have figured it out, but ill blame the fact that I had been up since 4am.

Once properly seated, I was able to enjoy the best coffee and donuts the city (world) has to offer. I advise anyone to skip their usual cream and sugar and experience the flavor of that coffee raw. really good stuff. Granted, I was a little late to get the donuts fresh from the fryer, but damn, were they still the best I'd had and as a baker, Ive eaten cake donuts right out of the fryer before.

I may have missed the hot donuts but my arrival meant I was one of the first to get a golden ticket for chicken. I was also lucky enough to have an eating companion there, who offered a mix and match scenario with the chicken so I was able to try both the Chili Garlic and the other (whose name I forget but it was the dry rub one). Both rocked my world and were just as good leftover later that night.

In my time at FD, I witnessed a staff that was  amazing. Blake was a fountain of donutcoffeechicken information, Felicia was the perfect ""face"" of the Front of the house and the BOH staff were a grim lesson in startling efficiency and ingenuity. The magic that they work in that small space was impressive. Unfortunately, there was a computer malfunction, that threatened to bring down the store's mojo. Skynet is truly taking over. Yet I watched these heroes, power through the hurdle like pros as the patient masses accepted the situation with quiet reverence, knowing that they have a good thing going here and to complain would kill it.

I will cop to being a personal friend to a few of the staff here, but that should take nothing away from my great experience. There's a simplicity to Federal Donuts that will keep this endeavor afloat for as long as it wants to be. I propose to all national sports coverage, that henceforth, you can quit the cloying shots of louts making cheesesteaks in your cutaway shots and get a camera in FD, to show the real working class spirit of Philadelphia and foods that are actually appetizing.

We had reservations for 6:30 and we were seated immediately.  While being shown to our table, I requested a four top and was happily shown to a very nice table.  Immediately they got 5 stars from me for service!!!  My husband and I enjoy sitting next to each other when we can be accommodated and it was a treat tonight.  The restaurant filled up quickly soon after.

The simple decor and lack of warmth are deceiving.  I was surprised that it is a steakhouse with painted black walls throughout with one large metal sign ""S & H Green-stamps"", (Surely a collectible). Simple wood tables (maybe veneer) and black vinyl  upholstered seating.

The bar looks kind of cheesy but offers top shelf liquor; drinks are pricy, my raspberry Cosmo was $13.50 and my husbands Macallan was $16.25. Pours are exact. 

My fillet was ""sensational"" and cooked perfectly. A selection of several steak sauces are made to order. My husband had their NY Strip which he finished!  The menu is À la carte - $32.00 for the small fillet, served with the tiniest sprig of parsley.  But no denying meat was delicious!

Recommendations for Marmont Steakhouse and bar, TABLE LINENS ARE A MUST!  The condensation of all our beverages ran off the table right towards our laps.  My husband asked for an extra napkin and placed it under his setting as a place mat. Tablecloths are important, especially at a steak house and definitely at any establishment where the average bill will be over $100.   A candle or flower on the Table will go a long way helping create a comfortable atmosphere!

Random FYI...the restaurant is comfortable and easily accessible for anyone with disabilities.  The rest rooms are down a steep flight of stairs with a banister. The ladies room needs a good ceiling to floor cleaning. ( no amenities again I would expect in keeping with the price of this restaurant)

The Hostess was quick to welcome us with a smile and quickly asked if we'd like our coats checked.  Once seated we were asked what type of water we'd like (not that this mattered to us, but it was nice to have the choice), and were given our menu's and the specials for the day.  The Waiter was more than pleasant and we ended up having a great discussion and felt like we knew him after a short conversation, I believe his name was Bob.  So the service was beyond what I had expected.  

The food was fantastic tasting.  I had the Filet while my wife had the shrimp meal.  I honestly believe that my filet was UNDER-priced.  It was cooked perfectly to my liking (medium rare) and was very tender, also a good size.  My wife's meal was also very delicious, but it was very small.  I believe there were only 5 or 6 shrimp.  I understand the difference in dining philosophies in the world vs. america (small flavorful meals vs. large crap meals) but this seemed far too small to both of us based on the price of the meal.  It would have made an amazing appetizer.

Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant to friends, but maybe ask about portion size before ordering.",2012-12-11 16:11:09,"{'food': ['Filet', 'Shrimp'], 'drink': []}"

I decided to go with my fiance' and some friends last night for Philly Beer Week to try the new Tired Hands Brewery (Ardmore) since they were doing an event there.  I have to say, I was quite impressed by the Boilermaker.  

First off, the room is absolutely gorgeous.  It is a far cry from the dingy Doc Watson's that used to occupy this building especially upstairs.  Like most other reviewers have already noted, the place is lit almost entirely by candle light and has a very cool gothic feel to it.  It was a relaxed atmosphere and not at all pretentious

Second, the beer list was impressive.  I was expecting this...though I did not have a good experience at Fork and Barrel, the beer they offered there was nothing short of outstanding, but tended to be very expensive.  Since Farmer's Cabinet is right around the corner and offering a lot of the rare international beers, The Boilermaker focuses more on American craft beer at VERY reasonable prices.  Most beers were between 4-6 bucks and served in the proper glassware (smaller 6.5 ounce pours are offered for all beers at about half the price!).  Some of the higher alcohol beers were a bit more expensive, but still within the 6-8 dollar range.  

Finally....the food.  This was what had me most worried.  As I mentioned above, Fork and Barrel didn't impress and I have heard similar gripes about the Farmer's Cabinet kitchen.  I am happy to say that the food was on point at Boilermaker.  It was simple, well cooked and tasty.  I had a soft shell crab BLT and my fiance had a Reuben and both were equally delicious.  All of the sandwiches were also reasonably priced ($11 for the soft shell crab sandwich!).

Overall I had a great time but there were two things that I would offer a bit of criticism about.

First - The beer list is numbered and the wait staff asks that you order by number.  This kind of leads to a bit of confusion because the list was not in chronological order, so you have to keep going back to the list to remember what number you need to say.  This also causes confusion when the beers are served because the waitress would reference them by number and on more than a few occassions wasn't quite sure which beer was which

Second - Also relating to the number - On three separate occassions, the wrong beer was brought out.  I think this again has to do with the fact that they are placing the order with the bar by number and might not necessarily know what the actual beer is.  

Given that it is Philly Beer Week and there are a lot of events going on that require quick turnovers of the tap, I can forgive this...I just hope that it's not something that continues as it was a bit annoying. - *Quick edit after posting...Will (the owner) personally messaged me to confirm that the numbering system for Beer Week can be a bit of a challenge this week due to the constant tap change over as I suspected...completely understandable given the number of events that they have been hosting this week!)

Overall, I was happy with the experience and will definitely be back soon (especially for the happy hour which I have heard is pretty fantastic).  Since this was my first visit, I gave it 4 stars but after repeat visits and assuming that it is of the same high quality as my first experience I would have no problem bumping it up to 5",2012-06-08 13:39:25,"{'food': ['soft shell crab BLT', 'Reuben'], 'drink': ['Boilermaker']}"

There was a line when we got there with parties all greater than 2.  There were two empty seats by the counter at the window so we went up to ask the cashier if we could sit there.  She kinda ignored us and told us someone would help us.  A few minutes later, she offered the lady standing in line behind us something to drink and gave her some water.  Hello?!  We've been waiting for a while....why didn't you offer us or the other 10 people in line something to drink while we waited?   We waited for 20 mins only to get seated at the window in the 2 empty spots that we had inquired about.  At least the gentleman that seated us (our waiter) was super nice and quick about getting us our food. I ordered the Salmon Platter and it was pretty good.  Please note, if you get the Salmon Platter, do not get it with brioche.  My brioche was toasted and so crumbly that I kept coughing and choking on it. I had to constantly wash it down with my coffee.  My gf wasn't enjoying her meal and said it was just okay.  

Overall the food was okay probably something you could make at home and the service was not so great.  The cashier lady was rude and didn't even greet us.  Though she was surprisingly very nice when we went up to pay for our meal.  She even had the courage to ask us how our meal/visit was....

This is definately a place for a civilized dinner and unlike some of the other steakhouses in the city (cough Palm cough) you can hear the people talking to you on your table.
We went there last night for a boys night out - a few guys on the town, they had a BYOW Febuary which is great.
We had the biggest juicyest oysters I've had in the states for appetizer with the classic cocktail sauce/lemon on ice. I love my oysters and these were close to perfect.
As for the meat; I am not usualy a big fan of steak houses - just because I can generally grill a great steak myself and get a great result and so I am almost always slightly dissapointed by steaks when I order them in a restaurant. Unless the meat itself is pehomenal  (like Peter Lugar for example) or something in the preparation takes it to the next level - I am not big on steak house steaks. 

Prime rib is not much different in that respect. I've the regular steaks there - the NY strip and the Filet and they are very good but not amazing. This time I figured I would give the NY strip which is usualy my favorite cut a try and it confirmed my opinion on steak houeses steaks. The steak was very good - slightly more overcooked than the medium rare I ordered but overall I was not overly impressed.

The one thing that keeps me coming to the Prime Rib is -  the prime Rib. The prime rib is juicy meaty with the staple fat ring around and flavor I often dream of. I am not usualy fan of rib steaks (a little too fatty) but you can't beat a great prime rib and they definately perfected . it here.

As far as sides -  creamed spinach was a little runny this time which was a dissapointment, they blanched the aspargus to death but the potatoe skins saved the day.
Didn't do desserts this time but I remember fundly the creme burlee and the Key Lime.
Service was great, atmosphere lovely.

What else? service is always great every time I been there. It's a great place for a bigger group - we were 6-7 people with a huge round table and super comfy seats.

Their margaritas are really good. It's three margaritas in one price, making it a great value. If you're on the sweeter side, go for the prickled pear marg. If you like it with a kick, go classic and choose your favorite tequila (they have a good selection). Their classic margs are also $5 on Mondays from noon to 7. 

Their food is greasy and overloaded, but that's exactly what you come to Copa for. Everyone knows Wednesday means half-off all burgers. Favorite is the Toluca because it has chorizo and Chihuaha cheese. If you're attempting to be healthier, their black bean option is good. If you order a burger, be hungry because these bad boys will fill you up. If you're looking to share, the primo nachos may be right up your alley. Sour cream, avocado, cheese, pico de gallo - the dream team. Add some meat for an extra dollar and you've yourself a hefty meal. Of course, it's unhealthy - it's fake Mexican food.

It gets busy from Thursday to Saturday (although Saturday is surprisingly the most tame of the days). The restaurant gets a good mix of both student and local area clientele. Copa Underground, a strange club that Copa runs underground (hence the name) also keeps the place poppin' on weekends.

that's all the ordering choices you get, as you are handed a ticket as a proof of purchase and wait for your name to be called.  there is a pickle and pepper bar, complete with take home containers and a myriad of condiments that surely would suffice as sidekick to your sandwich.  the wait was long, so i couldn't help myself to just snacking on a few cherry peppers while i waited.

the sandwich had a nice roll.  i mean, a really good roll. fresh too, even though it was 9pm, and probably near the bottom of the roll inventory.  the steak was good too.  plain enough for people who like bland food, yet, satisfying enough for everyone else.  it was virtually absent of grease, which sort of missed during the consumption of the sandwich, but not shortly thereafter.

Like many  of these establishments, F+F is small and tastefully decorated.. honestly, I could not really even tell you what art was on the walls or what music was playing because my eyes were fixed on the beautiful plates that were coming out of the kitchen.

My date and I immediately felt right at home as my date recognized one of our fellow diners as regulars at Zahav (clearly lovers of fine eats). We sat between two servers at Osteria and two chefs (I don't recall their restaurant) who were more than eager to chat about food, restaurants, wine... everything. Some have called F+F's smaller space a drawback, but honestly I enjoy sitting so close to others. It encourages conversation, allows me to spy what other plates look like, and really  can be great fun when you're surrounded by the right people. 

It's crazy to say, but I think the highlight of the meal was the first course Beet Steak. Not only was the plate stunning to look at, but they actually elevated beets to a level I hadn't thought possible. Our second course of Poached Wyebrook Farm Egg came in a close second with my date nearly licking the bowl clean.

Longer version: Tandoor is one of the few Indian restaurants close to where I live and I've gone there many times. My principal reason for going to Tandoor is that it offers a reasonably priced dinner buffet and definitely has better food than the New Delhi restaurant next door: for about $10 it's all you can eat, which I think is a pretty good deal. They have a wide variety of foods to choose from, and most of them taste about adequate, but their gulab jamuns in particular are delectable. It's also usually clean, and not noisy, so it's a decent option if you just want to spend an evening conversing with friends.

However, set against their above-average food and ambience is their dour, almost-hostile staff. They were never particularly welcoming or courteous, but on my last visit, they were actually rude. Besides, they don't bring out food on time either. Now, I expect this behavior from an inexpensive place like the nearby Dana Mandi (which by the way has the best Indian food in this area), but not from Tandoor. 

I see from other reviews that take-out is perhaps a better option; maybe the food tastes better and you won't have to deal with the staff. But for dining in, I wouldn't really recommend the place. And the sad part is that Tandoor can so easily fix their problem: all they need to do is to give their waiters some basic lessons in courtesy.",2015-12-11 01:19:02,"{'food': ['gulab jamuns'], 'drink': []}"

In over two hours of sitting at our table, I was able to obtain exactly two beers. It took over ten minutes for our server to tell me that they were out of the first beer I ordered. After waiting over fifteen minutes for him to return with the second bottled beer I ordered, he asked me if I wanted another of my first beer because he forgot I had already asked for something different. After that, I waited another fifteen minutes for it, ten of which the beer was sitting on the end of the bar perhaps fifteen feet away. I probably would have tried five or six of their premium beers. Everyone else at the table had similar problems, and we never seemed to get any water.

I am rarely displeased with Mexican food, but the quesadillas were the worst I've ever had. The garlic mashed potatoes and citrus chicken tasted the same somehow. The staff bringing things out from the kitchen had no idea which table's food they were carrying. We were constantly asked if we ordered whatever they happened to be carrying, and an enchilada meant for someone in my party ended up going to someone at the table next to us (who immediately started eating it). After waiting for another enchilada to be made, it came out covered in sour cream, when my friend had specifically asked for none. Even though he hates sour cream, he ate around it rather than waiting for a third attempt.

When the bill came, I found that I was charged for the beer they were out of as well as the two I actually had. When I brought it to the server's attention he seemed to know exactly what I was going to say, which was at the least very sketchy. It took quite a long time to get it removed from the check, which our server told us the manager had to approve. The manager was sitting behind the bar on his phone, drinking a beer. He never came over to address any of the issues we had.

I went with the Risotto, which I highly regret. Risotto is a high risk-high reward dish as it's not easy to make and needs a lot of attentions to detail (i.e. constantly stirring for 20+ minutes). Given all the warning signals of the first 10-15 minutes of the restaurant, it was foolish for me to order a complicated dish that needed a high attention to detail. A simple pasta with red sauce would have probably been safer. But, I ordered a risotto, and the restaurant made it poorly. 

Certainly would not recommend this place, and is one is looking for a meal in Center City, there undoubtedly are better places than LaScala's.",2015-11-28 21:31:13,"{'food': ['Risotto'], 'drink': []}"

I had my usual Willie Sutton to drink, yum as always. One of the soups du jour was potato leek, an absolute favorite of mine. I ordered a bowl which was perfect after the addition of some salt and pepper; very smooth and creamy. Boyfriend and I also each ordered a cubano sandwich which came with fries. The cubano was thick with ham, pork, melted swiss and mustard. The pickle was wrongly served on the side, but a quick fix. It was served panini style on thick bread that was a bit too dry. I took half the sandwich home and it was much tastier the second time around -- the bread didn't seem as dry and I did add some creamy horseradish sauce, which was a great addition.

Creamy and rich, as well as super filling. If you're ordering one of the pasta dishes and you don't have a bottomless pit of a stomach, it's likely you're going to have leftovers (which I love). The mushroom ravioli is SO GOOD. And so is the sweet potato appetizer! A word of advice though: the asparagus salad does not feel very salad-like. Its just a couple of eggs over easy sitting on top of cooked asparagus with some bacon. Not particularly flavorful or wowing. 

The ambiance of this place is pretty on point if you ask me. The first time I went there Eta James played quite a few times, along with other calm, but soulful music that was never overpoweringly loud. The restaurant is fairly low lit and there are cute fake candles on all the tables. They also keep the front door to the place closed, so there's no background noise coming in from Broad St. They do have a TV in there, but it's mounted near the entrance and it's the only one. Overall, it's a nice restaurant but not pretentiously so. 

If you're not ordering pasta, I might be a little more critical of the food. I recently ordered their ""Hanger Steak,"" asking that it be done ""medium rare"" and there was only one piece of steak that had some pink to it. All the other pieces were well done. Disappointing for a dish that was $23. I've also noticed that they tend to overcook asparagus, until it's soft, easy to bend, and a nuisance to cut through (the Hanger Steak came with asparagus, as well as another dish my partner's mom got- same issue with her asparagus). 

As for the garlic knots? Sometimes they're awesome- warm and soft on the inside. When they're room temperature you realize they're nothing crazy. BUT the garlic oil is delicious and I personally want to try making some myself. They lightly boil the cloves in oil till they're tender and as easy to spread on the knots as butter. 

Oh! Something else I noticed that was kind of weird. They use the square app, so your server will just come up to you with a tablet in hand once you've given them your card. They don't leave the tablet there for filling out, they just hold it out in their arms and wait for you to finish filling the form out. At first I thought it was nice (fan of the paperless route), but then I felt kind of awkward not being able to take a second to consider how much I wanted to tip. I didn't notice this myself, but a friend of mine mentioned that the standard options for tipping also start at 18%. While that doesn't necessarily bother me, I could see that being a nuisance for others that might prefer 15%. There's also a 2 card max to the table, so venmo is your friend if you want to eat here with other people. 

Last time I went there I made a reservation and still ended up waiting around 15 minutes. Maybe this was just because they had two really large groups of people with reservations for the night, but it was kind of off-putting since they had tables open. 

TL;DR: order pasta if you come here. Ambiance is nice, not pretentious or too fancy. Other dishes that are not pasta might not be as amazing. Don't forget the place is BYOB!",2017-09-25 21:09:19,

I just happened to be stopping through Phili on the way back to NC on the 4th of July.  The town was insane, so we just grill a little food had some beers and passed out.  When I awoke I had a hunger like no other.  I said, ""I want good meat, but not a cheesesteak, and I'm not dressing up, point me int he right direction"".

When I was told we were heading to a Jose Garces establishment I got a little giddy.  As soon as I walked in the door I saw the sign that said duck fat fries, we instantly ordered 2.  Not quite feeling the hair of the dog yet, I just ordered a water while gazing at the menu.  The fries came quick and they sooooo did the job.  The cheese sauce was light and didn't over power the fries.  Since these were so good we decided to see what the tater tots were all about.  They did not standout quite as well.  Nothing special by any means.

After staring at this relatively short menu for a while I figured out what the deal was.  You get a burger, then you put stuff on it.  I went with the $26 Whiskey King(medium rare), it just seemed like that is what i was supposed to do at that point.  An 8oz angus patty, maple bourbon glazed chipolini's, Rogue blue cheese, applewood bacon, and some foie gras.  My counterparts did the same, but added a few more ingredients.  By this time I was the only one that didn't have a cocktail or a e-a-fied milk shake.  So, I got an IPA.

When waiting for our food the local inspector came by, she looked pretty pleased, you can probably go see her findings on your next stop by.  Once the food came we were enveloped by boisterous burgers.  HUGE plates of food for a lunch.  But, oh so tasty.  I don't consider myself that much of a big spender, but had no problem spending it here.  The Foie added a perfect little creaminess to the burger(think rich avacado, but with the taste of meat).  It took all I could to get this whole thing down, but there was no way I'd miss a bite.

Bottom line is, I spent a few days in phili and this was by far the best food I had, although it was a burger for lunch and was also the most expensive meal I had.

Although it was during Father's Day lunch time, the restaurant does not seem overly crowded. The interior decoration captured my attention soon as I entered the restaurant. Jones provides three types of seating options: 2 person table, 4 person booth and group booth.

Food -
I ordered chicken with waffles and a side of tater tots. Unfortunately, the quality of the dish did not meet the standard that all these 4 & 5 stars reviews have set. When my food came out, it was 'simple' looking. Two pieces of fried chicken with half of a waffle and a side of gravy. The gravy was in room temperature, waffle was slightly soggy (before I put the gravy on) and the fried chicken was dry and in room temperature. Note that the even the dark meat portion was dry too. All of these indication made me think that my dish was sitting around for a little while before they brought it out.

My friend ordered an ALT sandwich. There's no way that server was waiting for her order to complete before she brought both dishes to our table.  

Drinks -
My friend and I both chose the bottomless bellini option, $21 per person. We got a bottle of house selected champagne and three flavors of mixers - White peach(decent), mango(delicious) and orange juice(neither of us used it). The mixers came in a mini mason jar which was really cute! I'd say if you have a few hours to spare and a good company to chat with, this is your option. 

Definitely will try their bloody mary(vodka based)/maria(tequila based)/derby(whiskey base). Plenty of interesting choices for garnishes.

So, it's hard for me to dis on a place and especially Cheu since I love Ben Puchowitz's restaurant Matyson. I also really want to like Cheu because its ambience reminds of the BEST noodle bar in D.C. Toki. 

But the ambience is all it has going for it right now, especially after being charged $14 for a large bowl of a minimal amount of noodles in my Cold Sesame noodle order.

How do you mess up Cold Sesame Noodles? And how do you warrant charging $14 for half the bowl of noodles? Was I paying for the ambience alone?
I ordered Cold Sesame noodles on a really hot day in July thinking its your basic Asian meal, not too much can go wrong there and it won't break the bank. BOY was I wrong!

First of all, the point of a noodle bar is overflowing noodles in your bowl not the other way around. And even though you don't want to stay authentic to a tradition of cooking ramen, the basics are still important. 

My noodles were too al dente. The pork belly was a nice touch but if that was the reason for the $14 bill then no thank you. The kimchee cucumber on top covered with chili oil was a nice touch but it was poorly done,the kimchee lacked the original balance of just enough sourness to just enouph spice to give it its umph. Instead it was doused with chili oil that took away from the flavor of the noodles. And even though Laban praised this dish as close to authentic my authentic asian palette states otherwise.

For now I'll stick to the lesser of two evils and frequent the Ramen chain that is Terakawa. It's broth is on point and its noodles overflow the bowl. 

Ben, a small suggestion, don't stray too far from traditional flavoring when your dealing with oriental cuisine and don't rush to add too many culinary delights to the menu before mastering what your ""noodle bar"" is named after.",2013-09-13 21:16:53,

I always try to stop by whenever we are in Philly, we actually came here a few times from NY just to have dinner here.  Did I mention that I love this place?  My ultimate goal is to try all of the dishes on the menu, which has been difficult as I always order the same 2-3 dishes each time.  See below for the dishes I have tried, which are ranked based on my preference:

Prah-Hok Kateeh - My absolute favorite dish and I have to order it every time I come here.  It doesn't look much in pictures, but trust me, you will love it.  It is basically ground pork that is flavored to perfection and you eat it with an assortment of vegetables.  I can eat this dish everyday!  Actually Khmer Kitchen inspired me to try to replicate this dish at home, I have tried a bunch of different variations of this dish using recipes from the internet, and none have even come close to the ones served here.

Sah-Law Machue Yuin - Another dish that I always order. It is a sweet and sour soup that comes with either chicken, fish or shrimp.  My personal favorite is the fish version.  Due to the fact that there are no Cambodian restaurants in NYC, I try to order a similar dish when I go to Vietnamese restaurants, but needless to say, none have come close to this dish.  I love the fresh pineapples (most other places use canned ones), and the gourd melon, which I have never had before I came here, now I love it!

Cha Throp - stir fried eggplant that comes with either pork or chicken.  I love the pork version, the pork just melts in your mouth.  The flavor could be similar to eggplant with garlic sauce from Chinese restaurants, but Khmer Kitchen uses big pieces of perfectly flavored pork instead of group pork, which I think makes a huge difference

Cha Mussels - The sauce for this dish is out of this world.  True story, my friend actually took the leftover sauce to go so that she can eat it over rice for lunch the next day, no mussels, just the sauce.  The mussels are great too, but the sauce this the star of this dish, and I kind of wish they serve bread with this dish so I can sop up that delicious heavenly sauce.

Pleah Sak-Koe- It is basically a rare beef salad.  For people who are a bit squeamish about eating rare beef, this is probably not the dish for you. For the more adventurous eaters, give this a chance.  It is super refreshing, particularly during the summer.  Could be a bit spicy, so be forewarned!

Sah-Law Machue Kr'ung - another soup with either chicken or beef.  I liked the aforementioned sweet and sour soup better, but this one has my favorite protein, i.e. beef.  The beef is super tender and flavorful.  I picked out all of the beef while everyone else was busy talking (no, that's not rude at all)

Kuh-Puh Ch'in - Shrimps that are lightly battered and fried to perfection.  I am not a huge fan of shrimp, but if I have to eat shrimp, I would eat this any day.

Cha La-Pauh - stir fried pumpkin with either chicken or pork.  I don't like pumpkin, but the pork in this dish is so yummy.  I had to be sneaky and pick out the pork as I did with the previously mentioned soup.  Everyone that liked pumpkins at the table raved about this dish.

Cha Kr'ung - stir fry dish with celery and pepper, comes with either chicken or beef.  It was just ok, nothing too spectacular to report.  

Cha Lok-Lak - my least favorite dish.  It is basically beef cubes on a bed of lettuce.  Perhaps I should've dipped the beef in the sauce longer, but it is not as flavorful as the rest of the menu.

This is a family restaurant with the mother and grandmother in the back cooking, and coming here feels like going home to mom's cooking, well if your mom is Cambodian and an amazing cook.  The waiter is super friendly, I assume he's the son/grandson to the chefs.  He's always very patient in answering whatever questions we have, and always accommodating with all of the annoying requests I have (i.e. more vegetables for the Prah-Hok Kateeh, more napkins, takeout containers for the leftover sauce).  The only downside is that the hours can be unpredictable, so definitely call beforehand.  I have been disappointed numerous times because they had to close early, or open late for various reasons, as I don't live in Philly, I couldn't wait around for them to open.  It has been a running joke between us that we are 'lucky' if the place is actually open when they say they would.

Well, the first and foremost thing to be said is this: this was probably the best cheesesteak I've had in all my life.  It was absolutely delicious, perfect, heavenly.  Seriously, it was completely awesome.  A description won't do it justice - the bread was fresh, the meat and cheese and onions - you've got to try one.  Anyone who actually has a cheesesteak there on a good day will NOT be disappointed.  
That's why I'm giving this 5 stars.  The decor inside - it was dingy, it was a dive restaurant, that seemed to me to be a bit of the charm of the place.  

The name of the place... I don't really have an opinion on that - I'm not offended, but I'm not Asian - to anyone who is offended by it, I'm sorry and I respect that.  But, I would still recommend going there and trying a cheesesteak - the owner seemed very friendly, and the staff was professional and very cool - I don't think that anyone there would ever give anyone a problem because of their ethnicity.  It's not my place to advise anyone to just ""get over"" the name - if that's going to be a deal breaker as to whether or not to go to this place, then there's nothing I can do about it - but, with my restaurant reviewing reputation on the line, I can say with no reservations - it's a damn good cheesesteak.",2008-02-20 16:44:59,"{'food': ['cheesesteak'], 'drink': []}"

The food was not great.  The bluefish appetizer was served cold, which was not indicated on the menu, and was a little undercooked.  I had the pigs ear salad, which was way too salty, and the pigs ears were basically inedible.  Normally, I love pigs ears, but these were tough, chewy, and didn't sit well in my belly.

On to the main course.  I had the old spot pork, which was chewy and overdone, and got cold right after coming out.  Honestly, I've had better prepared pork from my local butcher.

I ordered the Ichiban roll - salmon, masago and unagi wrapped in crunchy. I didn't really know what ""crunchy"" was, but I decided to take my chances anyways. As I expected, they were tempura flakes, but different to those I'm used to, these were really small / smushed flakes and seemed like it was quite old. The salmon, eel and masago themselves were fresh from what I can taste. The salmon was fatty, but still had the silver lining on it (which I kind of dislike, but since it was hidden in the roll, I wasn't too bothered). Now, what really almost made me want to gag is... the pink sauce.

What is the pink sauce?! It was a bright-ish pink color and had the consistency of mayonnaise. So, think pink colored liquid soap. That's what it looked like. The adventurous side of me decided to taste it - pretty much a sweet mayonnaise sauce. But, I just couldn't get over the color and the artificial-ness of it all, and pushed the sauce, along with most of the ""crunchy"" to the side.

Pricy but without the value, and in a sort of odd location across from the old Penn ice rink, St. Declan's has much promise but based on how dead it was on a recent Saturday night, is going to have to change some things up fast to fulfill that promise.

The decor looks like it was expensive buildout - they joined together the former sushi place with another space to make a bigger joint, with a bar on one side and a restaurant area slightly screened from the TV/bar, complete with stone pillars - and they put in nice tables and chairs. But the decor is awkward: some Irish scenes in oil paintings (see pictures) and a few knick knacks, so it's sort of a cross between your TGIFriday's ambiance and the intended neighborhood pub feel. So it's spacious, which is nice and what brought us there - good for groups, for now - but really feels weird, almost too nice and a little empty in a way. Just not your let's-go-hangout-and-get-some-color joint at all.

The menu is a mixture of standard American bar food, a few attempts at pub food (bangers and mash, for example), and some low-end entrees (salmon, eggplant parm, et alia). The bar features a lot of single malt scotch and irish whiskeys, although I did have to explain to the server that the number next to the scotch referred to its age, not the price. (Seriously). They are quite pricy by the glass, and oddly feature more Scots than Irish labels. It's not really the place to graze authentic single malts, unless you're made of money and just don't care about trying more than a half dozen or so.

The beer list is decent but again, a bit pricey.

The advantage of going with a very large party, many of whom are on their Nth repeat business is you can get fair warning about the food. Basically, the sandwiches and the appetizers are fine, and the higher end entrees extremely hit or miss (""disappointing"" was the description of our friend who was on his Nth repeat visit). So avoid the large plates and stick to the standards. Larger entrees are about $15 and up, standard sandwiches in the burger-Reuben range are $10ish, so it's not cheap.

Service was attentive and prompt, as was the kitchen service, but done without a lot of knowledge or flair. They put up with a large group quite well (but with a number of mistakes), which, again, is what brought us there.

It's the sort of place you're kind of rooting for but you have the sense it's not going to end well unless they gussy it up somehow - either give it character, or get the menu under control. As such it may be worth checking in on every now and then, fwiw.",2014-04-08 18:11:04,

The prices are reasonable.
I would have given them more stars for the food if the cons below didn't stick out so much.

Cons:
The waiter was a real piece of work (to coin it nicely). One time I attended with 5 colleagues for lunch. We weren't given the lunch spe ial menu and we were short one of the regular menus. We asked for separate checks and he just walked away rudely mumbling under his breath. We had to ask for water during the meal. He did not ask us how everything was once he delivered it. Then when he brought the check, it was not separated and he added a 20% (which he clearly did not earn) on the food AND THE TAX. None of our party felt that was justified, but we paid just to get out of there.
The bathrooms are pretty raunchy so go before you get there if you can. There is a sign not to put anything in the toilet - including t.p. Very third world in that respect.

I had specifically requested that restaurant because it was at the forefront of the whole 'farm-to-table' concept, which was relatively new at the time. It was one of the best meals we had had in NYC, so simple and yet the flavors were remarkable. When I heard about The Farm and Fisherman opening up where Paul used to be, and more importantly that the chef was of Blue Hill fame, I really really REALLY wanted to try them out asap.

I mentioned it only once to my bf, and when my birthday approached he announced that dinner reservations were already taken care of and 'it was a surprise.' I love surprises, but I was a little wary - not that he chose a bad place, but I assumed it wasn't The Farm and Fisherman because my own little sleuthing had turned up zero available reservation times there - until 3 weeks later. Imagine my ecstatic surprise when we arrived there.

The interior has been transformed since Paul, and the warm, intimate vibe is perfect for the space. It's very small, which is one reason reservations are hard to get, and perhaps a bit close quarters but the food makes you forget about anything else. And since it's BYO, everyone arrives with their drinks and proceeds to enjoy them as much as they do the food.

It was a tough call, but we started off with their Kirby Cucumber Soup (Buttermilk, sour gherkins, chocolate mint), which was creamy and refreshing, and the Smoked Rainbow Trout (Bacon, pea puree, spicy cress, bachelor's buttons), a dish that we agreed was the best smoked trout we'd ever had (yep, better than Telepan). I'm not a big lamb eater, but my bf really wanted to try the entrée because it was seasonal and I have to say that the Braised Lamb Shoulder (New potatoes, Poblano pepper, merguez), had wonderful complementary tastes that built in flavor with each bite. I personally preferred two 'second courses' for my entrée and ordered the Stuffed Quail (Smoked zucchini, apricots, pistachios) and Poached Jennings Farm Egg (Peas, hazelnuts, patty pan squash, pancetta, morels). The quail was fantastic - it's only half of one, but the apricots it's stuffed add a nice sweet-tart flavor to the game hen. My bf initially questioned my choice with the egg, but one bite shut him up. It's the best dish we ordered, and such a wonderful surprise. The poached egg sits in a semi-stew of fresh peas (seriously, the freshest I've ever had EVER), patty pan squash chunks, morels, roasted hazelnuts and the lingering smokiness of pancetta. It's a party on the plate AND in your mouth - the combination of colors, flavors and textures created an absolutely unforgettable dish. I couldn't have asked for more - and almost couldn't finish it! We had a lot of food, so unfortunately dessert was out of the question, but I really didn't care.

Much to my surprise, they're not just a great donut shop, but also one of the best fried chicken joints in the city. 

Now I've had fried chicken from the south all the way to the motherland of Kentucky. And Federal Donuts has found a way to capture what a delicious fried chicken should be like: Crispy, but not too oily skin, juicy meat that easily strips off the bone, and freshly made to order unlike the fried chicken that sits under heat lamps for hours on end. 

In addition to their perfectly fried chicken, they also have their own twist. Exotic and robust seasoning additions that bring the experience to a whole other level. They have a middle eastern seasoning that is to die for. What a great subtle way to diversify this typical American cuisine. 

In addition to ordering a half or whole chicken, you'll also get a homemade plain donut which is equally as appealing and sure to satisfy any sweet tooth. The rich doughy complexity is sometime you'll only find at high quality bakeries, glazed with a syrup that just bursts throughout your palate when you bite in. Oh boy this is not a healthy meal whatsoever, but this is one of the most indulging experiences you have to try at least once.

Today the address crowns itself as ""Di Nardo's - Famous Seafood.""  But when it comes to vintage history, for those of us of a certain age, a table at Di Nardo's is a re-creation of a more immediate past. From the yellow pine paneling to the red vinyl benches and from  the paper placemats with crab eating instructions to the baked potato wrapped in aluminum foil  Di Nardo's recalls dining in the 50's and 60's in the tradition of Walbers, Zaberer's and Bookbinder's.   After all, when was the last time you saw a salad composed of iceberg lettuce garnished with shredded carrots and Russian dressing served on a frosted glass dish in the shape of cabbage leaves?
We began our dinner with the snapper soup, something I haven't had since the days of the old restaurants I just mentioned.  Perhaps memory is more flavorful but this soup tasted more of the flour roux than anything else. I have to say that Di Nardo's is more than a bit high priced. A mixed fried seafood platter is far from a complicated or delicate preparation and a tag of 32.50 for this retro selection is nothing short of excessive.  The flounder, fried and broiled, offered nothing exceptional that you couldn't do yourself. Then too, I buy my fish either at H-Mart or on 9th Street so $22 for a small piece of fish was more than four times what I would pay locally.
Perhaps the most humorous servings at Di Nardo's, other than  the iceberg salad, are the potatoes. You have a choice of either the foil wrapped baked potato with sour cream or French fries. What serious restaurant still offers these? At least the foil wrapped potatoes were not in the shape of a swan (Do you remember your childhood joy when you saw them?)
The menu prices are even more questionable since the restaurant features a sports bar from which they clearly derive supportive revenue. When it comes to such things as the crab menu, why pay Di Nardo's prices when you can enjoy crabs at a far less cost on 9th Street.
I do have to say that the wait staff and the management were most attentive and extremely friendly.But who do they say ""Bon appetit"" in French rather than ""Buon Appetito"" in Italian?
We dined at Di Nardo's only because we had a Groupon and because it is a Philly establishment that we had never experienced.
Di Nardo's food is a trip to the old fried fish restaurants that have long since left this world. The food was not bad but certainly nothing exceptional and nothing I could not do myself. I learned nothing and experienced nothing new.

Our glasses eventually came, as did the food.  Silverware came along a little later.  I wish the silverware never arrived.  The food was epically bad.  The goat roti was filled with meat still attached to bone pieces.  The same goes for the jerk chicken.  How lazy do you have to be to not butcher the bones out of  goat?

last nite's meet-up to discuss 'a confederacy of dunces' landed our small group in graduate hospital's la va cafe. it's a neighborhood i don't often find myself in, but la va is reason enough to come back. to be fair, all that i sampled on this particular evening was a delicious peppermint latte. tho pricey ($4+), it is on par with the similar beverage at starbucks, only this one was served in a real mug (to-go cups are, of course, also available) with the added bonus of a lovely leaf design in the foam. little touches like that make me smile.

some other book clubbers nibbled on tasty looking brownies and danishes, but i was, pathetically, so busy trying to finish up the last 20 pages that food wasn't exactly my priority. when i come back, i might just have to get myself a bowl of soup, which, according to their menu, varies daily but is ALWAYS VEGETARIAN. ooooo-weeee! whoa!

the cafe is large (esp for a non-chain), well lit and conducive to most anything one would want to do in such a space. while our chatty book club dominated the couch corner on this winter wednesday nite, la va was boppin - with a menagerie of people (ie, no hipster haven here!) reading, studying, drawing, conversing, eating... this was not a library-esque setting where you felt like silence was golden. those who wanted their peace plugged in their headphones, and the rest of us enjoyed the good tunes playing in the background.",2010-01-22 04:48:07,"{'food': ['peppermint latte', 'brownies', 'danishes', 'soup'], 'drink': ['peppermint latte']}"

The restaurant did something wonderful and unexpected -- I was given a comped order of the Beef Tartare, which I thought was one of the best dishes I had that night.  The Escargots were enjoyable, but my main course of the Pork Loin was a little dry and needed more seasoning.

LOTS of food. No silverware, no flatware. Oh well lets go with it. The novelty was cool but wore off once the food that came out wasn't so finger friendly. Don't worry, we got a bath towel instead. 

First course was especially difficult to eat. An assortment of salads?!!? I developed a skill in pita scooping but still not as convenient as I would like. 

The next couple of courses were varieties of chicken, lamb couscous etc... The standard Moroccan fare. Tea, baklava and fruit for the final two courses.

My sandwich had mayo and cheddar cheese on it, and a healthy portion of sliced brisket.  The sandwich also comes with jalapeno peppers, but I didn't get those because my stomach can't handle them.  The sandwich is served on Texas toast.  It was incredible.  With the sandwich came a ton of hand cut shoe stringed fries.  They too were delicious.

With the wall facing the street being all windows, the inside was flooded with natural light. They had a quite large sushi and bar counter in the middle, with seating all around it. They also had small two-person booth seating on the side as well. Very clean decor, I am glad they didn't put up any kind of cheap or fake Asian ""artworks"" on the wall.

We ordered an appetizer and side dish to go with our sushi rolls. We chose Creamy Rock Shrimp, Lobster Fried Rice, Sindy Roll and Old City Roll. All in all, they were all very tasty, high quality and we enjoyed them very much. Yes, everything was perfect until we ordered some desserts... 

Since they didn't have a dessert menu, we ordered Tree Cake and Green Tea Cheesecake based on the description of the dessert that our waitress gave us. 

This so-called Tree Cake...I call it ""rip-off"" cake. Our waitress described it as a cake made with almond, egg and butter. When it came out, I was shocked what it really was... If you are familiar with a common and popular sweets in Japan, one of them is called Baumkuchen which is actually a German layered cake. They can be purchased from most bakeries and stores, and not so pricey unless you go to some fancy boutique to get it. The cake we were presented with, in my opinion, was store-bought, and sliced as thinly as possible. For $10, you can buy an entire cake!!! Very disappointing... And on top of that, it was dry (with these thin slices being cut off from the cake, I wonder how long it has been since the cake was first purchased?). And if that is not enough, we were given spoons to eat this...why? I don't know...

Our waitress was very friendly and polite, and we were well taken care of. Everything we had, other than the Tree Cake was great. High quality and tasty, a bit on pricey side, but that comes with the quality. I wish if we made a different choice with the dessert. But then, you live and you learn.

We ate in the bar, but unless the dining room is a shack of some sort, I can't imagine that it would be anything but possibly better then what we experienced.

The menu was inventive, and I knew things were off to a good start with the tostadas de ceviche appetizer, which had the perfect amount of citrus, and tender chunks of seafood. The octopus had a nice texture-- and I do not like octopus, but this go around it was surprisely not chewy. 

For dinner, the boy had the pork shank, which annoyed me because who goes to a pricey spot to get pork?? But I was silenced - it was awesome, crazy fall-off-the-bone tender when you sank your fork into it. 

I had the barbacoa, and though I've never really been much of a goat meat fan, it was incredible. Beware the tiny thai peppers sitting on the plate--unless your mouth is iron-coated, it'll burn a hole. The cactus salad on the side was also tasty!

Though the staff is said to still be the same, the quality just doesn't seem so. It's just not quite right -- the service is decent, though don't expect them to tell you prices for specials if they are not listed. The food has changed with the new chef and it just isn't working.

I decided to try this place as take out after seeing that it fills up quick to dine-in. Just wanted something easy and requested the Greek salad with greens and grilled chicken. She told me they can't add grilled chicken to the salad (weird, but ok?) but she'd put on a side of kabobs.

I showed up and found out my side of kabobs was $14 ($4 less than the platter, so I'm assuming they deducted for not including the sides?). I was surprised... I expected a side to be smaller and definitely less expensive.

The kabobs weren't great (Not worth the $14+tax) but the salad was good.

Ultimately I was most put off by the fact that my take out was not rung up anywhere but just told to another server who then pulled out a wad of cash and gave me incorrect change.

Being unfamiliar with the area, I did a quick Yelp search of nearby joints, and this place looked interesting, and close by. 

Mixed crowd. And one of the first things that jumped out at as was the loudness of the room. Not the jukebox or other music, but just the overall din. I don't know if it's the layout of the room, or what, but it was noticeably loud. If you're looking to engage in intimate conversation, this probably isn't the place. That being said, we were greeted right away by a pleasant staff member who told us that there was about a 20 minute wait. No problem. Interesting bar seating layout, but we just stood. When a table became available we were seated promptly. Our server was very polite, and rattled off a long extensive list of impressing sounding specials. We opted for some regular menu items, but the grilled cheese sure sounded tempting. My GF had the french onion soup and the BLT. Both of which she said were delicious. I had the crab hush puppy app, followed by the steak frite entree. The hush puppies were great, and were served with a thai chili sauce. The hanger steak was cooked as ordered as seasoned nicely. Had a nice flavor and was juicy and tender. It was served on top of the home cut fries, which had I known was the case, may have asked to have the fries off to the side, but then again, I don't like to mess with the chef's vision. But overall, we bother enjoyed our food very much.

Ever since Craig LeBan's glowing 3-bell review of Kanella, the place has been packed. Every evening as I walk by I see happy diners digging into delicious dishes. Elizabeth & I finally got our chance to be among them last week.

We went on a Wednesday night around 8:30 and, after putting our name in the book, ended up waiting about 30 minutes down the block at Tria for a table to open up. The chef charged out of the kitchen and was taking bookings on the phone, darted around the tables checking in with diners, and then strode back into the kitchen all in the time we were being seated and settling in. This place was definitely buzzing.



We were greeted with bread & dip and warm and friendly service. Although it was obvious that they were a bit behind, they were still handling the rush well.



We started with the fried Halloumi cheese, served with a fresh, zesty salad. Crispy coated with a dense, firm texture..this satisfied our craving for cheese.



The dolmades arrived alongside a cabbage salad and a softer cheese-like yogurt ball (labneh?). We weren't familiar with the stuffing inside the dolmades, somewhat more savory than the bulgar-based dolmades we've always made, but the leaves had that great tannic flavor and were toothsome enough.



This feta & thyme stuffed pastry was delicious; firm, chewy cheese combined with butter & thyme, it was like a Cypriotic version of cheese-stuffed sopapillas. While the honey made for a sweeter-than-normal appetizer, the sweet beet salad brought a more earthy & subtle sweetness to the flaky pastry. The combo of beet & honey salad was something we'd run across at Zahav recently, but paired up with the pastry it completed the dish.

At this point we were getting excited about the accompanying salads with each successive dish as plate after plate came out with a different fresh garnish.



The veal cheeks were on special that evening...fork-tender and oozing with a moist pan-sauce. This was the first time I'd even eaten a veal cheek, but I'd say this is a step up from something like a lamb shank...similar texture but much less pronounced and without the more gelatinous character you get with shanks sometimes.



Everything I read about Kanella said to try the lamb salad...let me add my voice to the chorus. We're suckers for good warmed green salads, but the ground lamb was perfectly cooked, with enough grill flavor but still moist and without alot of binding agent.If I'm in the neighborhood around lunch time, I'm stopping in here with my own pita and scoop the contents of this plate up in it.

As our meal was winding down, the chef stopped at our table and asked us genuinely enough what we thought. I hinted at a question about how much business had picked up after the 3-bell review, but we didn't really get a sense that it had made a difference on the way they handled service or prepared the meals. Our waiter jokingly said that he was the one whom CraigLeBan called in his review the 'soft-talker'...I didn't spot the Masterpiece Theater waiter that evening.",2009-03-27 04:47:16,"{'food': ['fried Halloumi cheese', 'dolmades', 'feta & thyme stuffed pastry', 'veal cheeks'], 'drink': []}"

Overall Rating 3.5 

Went here for dinner on a weeknight. We had the Fresh Uni, Sweet Shrimp, Soft Shell Crab Tempura with mixed mushrooms, Izumi rolls, Chirashi. 

The best dish was the Uni. It was served in the Sea Urchin Shell. It does taste fresh eventhough, the Uni is not open/prepared to order. I was told the chef, cleans it beforehand and served to order. (4.75 out of 5)

The Sweet Shrimp Nigiri was okay, nothing wow...maybe because the rice was a little too hard and sour to my tasting. You get the fried shrimp heads too (3.5 out of 5)

Soft Shell Crab Tempura breading was a little too thick for my tasting; pairing it with mixed mushroom was an interesting touch. It's different. It doesn't harmonize well the soft shell crab. I can see it, the mushroom as a separate side dish/appetizer because it has its own distinct taste. It's good alone. (3 out of 5 as a combo.  However separately; the crab was a 2.25 out of 5, the mushroom was a 3.75 out of 5)

Izumi rolls - It's a little too small for the price. Not sure if that combo works well with each other. Note: I'm bias when it comes to Sushi roll. I'm more of a purist when it's sushi. (2.5 out of 5)

Chirashi - Not worth it, as I said before, the rice was too hard and sour for my taste. The little thin cuts of fish weren't really good/fresh. It also lacks presentation. It's just pieces of fish lay on top of rice. Yes, a Chirashi by definition are ""pieces of fish lay on top of rice"", but normally it's better placed with some artist flare. Izumi's Chirashi are just placed on top.  (2.5 out of 5)",2011-10-10 14:58:22,"{'food': ['Uni', 'Sweet Shrimp Nigiri', 'Soft Shell Crab Tempura', 'Izumi rolls'], 'drink': []}"

My favorite was when the guy next table to us asked the waiter ""do you have a knife or fork for this"".. and the answer was ""no, but we have more pita"".  LOL.   They just kept giving out pita the whole night.

Black Sheep, like many a Philly restaurant, is set up in levels, with a ground floor (actually slightly elevated) featuring a bar and restaurant setup with round tables and a wooden bar, while higher levels feature additional dining and drinking spaces.

To the experience, it was actually rather mixed. We stopped on the ground floor at a center round table. Within reach of the bar, we nonetheless had a waitress, and that was part of the problem. The waitress was quite slow and rather rude, annoyed since we would not get food as well as drinks. With four guys on the town, tips would have come either way, but eh, her loss.

After the drinks took a while in coming, we decided to place orders directly with the bartender, and the waitress blew up, yelling at us to pay her since we were ruining her night. Lovely....

Last Friday afternoon, I took the Bolt Bus from NYC to Philadelphia to meet a lovely old friend for drinks and dinner. She suggested this ""wine and cheese"" bar and gave me an address.  Little did I know that I'd still be talking about this little ""wine and cheese"" bar upon my return to NYC.  

Stumbling into Tria, I was faced with the difficult choice of outside seating or in... I changed my mind a few times (thank you thank you patient servers... I can't stand people who do this!) and settled on one of the high tops by the door inside the bar. 

Opening the menu was like Christmas Day. First of all, I've been dying to test out a beer (really, any beer) from Russian River which I eventually saw all over Philadelphia, because what one cannot have, one immediately wants. And given the lack of Russian River Brewery in NYC/NJ, I immediately wanted a beer from this specific brewery. Upon further inspection, I found some real gems beer-wise AND wine-wise and made the difficult decision to forgo the Russian River for a Oude Gueze style from a brewery of which I cannot remember.  I've been a sucker for these lately, for some reason. 

What followed was some awesome bruschetta, a fantastic array of cheese...

and... drum roll please... OUTSTANDING service. 

Tria, your food, wine and beer selection deserves an entire other review but... your service really struck a chord with me.  Why? Because, upon viewing your expansive curiosity inducing beverage menu, I was overcome with too many choices. Your server (I can't remember his name... he was a super friendly ginger-bearded guy) was SO helpful in guiding me in the right direction, pairing the wine (this is post-Oud Gueze) with the cheese we ordered. So friendly, so knowledgeable... that really goes such a long way. And not openly frustrated explaining everything to me. I hate apathetic service... to have someone so informative and friendly (in a low key way too... nothing pretentious!) waiting on me, I felt so welcome.   Upon returning home the next day, I told the restaurant manager where I worked about how helpful and knowledgeable the service was  (and sure enough he's heard of you!) -- I felt like at every point during our service he guided us in the right direction and made me feel like I made the right decision. 

I work in a restaurant who seems as passionate about food, beverage and service as yours is -- however, I can say that it has been quite a long time since I've stumbled into a place that I've been so smitten with that I'm already looking forward to returning for another happy hour with my friend. I will happily recommend this to anyone visiting Philadelphia and way to go on everything... if you ever think of expanding... NYC needs you!!!!! (and badly!)

Food: 4.5 stars
Its a food truck, so how high quality can the food be??  This is why the truck is so unique.  The ingredients are high quality, well prepared and served in generous portions.

Word to the first timers about ordering...
There are 2 plates on the menu.  Falafel Platter or Falafel Platter with Chicken.  There is no menu up or signs indicating what they serve.

The chicken is really a home-run.  Made with a great marinade, they shine.

Service: 2.5 stars
The owner of the truck and chef is a little different.  He is very forward and loves to engage in conversation and banter.  It can be a little excessive at times but its entertaining, too.  His service was prompt and on point.

Location: 3.0 stars
20th and Market St. on the North side of Market.  You'll see the smoke billowing from the truck...

Price: 4.0 stars
$8 per platter and you only can get 1 per customer if its busy.

Ambiance: 3.5 stars
The truck itself is unique, covered in plants and garlic clovers.  Its obviously a truck so its grab your food and go.  If you aren't taking it back to work, I would recommend a walk to Rittenhouse Park for lunch outside.

**Overall: 3.5 stars
The food is delicious and its quick.  Great for the work crowd and those that can get out to the truck for lunch.  Will definitely go back again.",2011-10-06 03:45:12,"{'food': ['Falafel Platter', 'Falafel Platter with Chicken'], 'drink': []}"

I like to try a place at least twice before I completely write them off.  This establishment tricked me three times.  The first visit was for takeout jerk chicken that was actually semi frozen in the center, though cooked through.  It had obviously been reheated perhaps from the day before.  The second was a Sunday where we waited for over an hour for our appetizers of overly dressed BQ wings, soggy coconut shrimp, and an incompetent server.  Entrees followed 30 min. later with bony chicken, hard, not-so-sweet-plaintains and tasteless rice.   On our third visit, we went Labor day nite, after a great weekend at the beach. We enjoyed the music, but again waited for an hour for our appetizers.  There were three servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off, inefficient to say the least.  They were working too hard for the 30 guests or so in the outside area.  Appetizers arrived of ceviche(almost completely devoid of seafood), soggy wings.  Sir may we have some forks at the very least??  Napkins...please?  Jerk chicken for dinner was just as disappointing as the other visits, lukewarm, very bony.  The Hut chops up the chicken, bone and all, which causes the multiple bone fragments.  I was seriously afraid of chomping/swallowing the splintery bones.  We paid, after we finally were able to chase down our server, and left without finishing our meals.  The server tried really hard to take care of everyone, but just didnt have the forethought to bring what was needed from the kitchen and save himself a trip before food is served.  I attribute this to lack of experience and planning.  Why not have utensils/napkins/water pitchers OUTSIDE where the guests are?  I LOVE jerk chicken, and this is a far cry from what I have sampled in the Islands.  We love the IDEA of the Jerk Hut,outside,live music,casual setting, bucket of beers shared with friends, but the food really is terrible, and overpriced for what it is,  and the service needs some serious work.",2008-09-02 16:16:09,"{'food': ['jerk chicken', 'ceviche'], 'drink': ['beer']}"

They also dont slice the pizza unless you ask for it (which I did) but mostly people just go at the pie with fork and knife which is how you are supposed to.

The reason for the two stars was a dishonest kitchen.  The onions were not caramelized, they were just sauteed.

One reviewer likens them to spaetzle and that works. Flavorful. The grits (in the shrimp and grits that I try everywhere I can) were quite good. Not too thick, not too thin, and well seasoned. The dirty rice was yummy. It was even better because it was a little drier than what you get in some places where it becomes gummy. And the crispy Andouille sausage was a great addition. The BBQ platter had moist pulled pork, overly dry St Louis ribs, and unremarkable bread. Mac and cheese did the south no credit. Wings were large, crispy, and right-out-of-the fryer hot.

Crawfish Mac N' Cheese: unbelieveable. I'll leave it at that 10/10
Entrees:
Crabcakes: tiny, but full of crab with little, to no filler. 10/10 taste, 8/10 for size
Braised Short Rib: topped with an over easy egg, this savory dish was the clear cut winner of the night. The juices from the meat soaked the farro and the meat was so tender you didn't need a knife to cut through. 10/10
Dessert:
Beignets: so. good. 10/10

Plenty of meat dishes, but no dice on those, as we're a couple who eschew muscle tissue. Oh, what was that, Waitress? You can make *any* dish vegetarian? Wordness to our mothers. 

So I get the tempeh spaghetti and the girlfriend orders the braised pork and cheddar sammy. Meanwhile, I'll have a Golden Monkey from Victory, served classy-style in a too-tall-but-at-least-I-look-classy glass. The same treatment for my Blithering Idiot later (yet another high-alcohol delicious beer). 

So far as I could tell, the tempeh spaghetti didn't actually have spaghetti in it - it had thinly-sliced zucchini. This was cool with me, because it made the dish lighter and tastier than your average over-cooked city pasta dish. And the sauce, which I can't describe because I'm not ""food-smart,"" was awesome. Sawesome?

My girlfriend's sammy was awesome, as well. They replaced the pork with what seemed like shredded-up tofu, drenched in cheddar and deliciousness.

Also, my girlfriend enjoyed a watermelon margarita, served in a martini glass, and with chunks of fresh watermelon in it. 

The check was, well, more of a $$$ than a $$, but, in their defense, the dishes themselves are $$ and my girlfriend and I understand that our discerning beer and mixed-drink palates have their price. All together, we will definitely keep this on our list of places to take peeps when they roll up all like ""Hey, take us to a good place for dinner and drinks, Joe.""

Comfort food and milkshakes, Mac 'n cheese, cheeseburgers, brunch items are all good, albeit expensive for what it is.
The noise level is less than it was. I am not sure why, but perhaps the incredible turnover of servers who had to yell in order to make themselves heard, and multiple complaints from patrons may have something to do with the fact that you can actually have a reasonable conversation these days. Actually, I almost wonder whether complaints were made to OSHA about the noise levels, because they were awful. Much better now.
Great.
Not so great. Poorly trained servers. She brought me tea. Cup of hot water and teabag. No spoon, no sweetener, no offer of cream or lemon. We had to ask and there were only 3 tables full in the restaurant at the time. So it's not like it was hopping.
We have always loved the Cobb salad. I'm not sure what has happened to it, but mine had 2 pieces of chicken in it. My husband's may have had 3. Bacon was clumped in a big ball. I had two big bacon balls and my husband had one. Huh?
We told our spoon-less waitress that we were disappointed with the salads and she looked at us blankly, never asking us for details. I called her back and she listened impatiently and said she would tell her manager. On the way out, I spotted the manager and told him. He totally blew me off. Didn't even make eye contact with me. Listened (I think) impatiently while making notes and perfunctorily said he was sorry. Guess what? He wasn't. It was so obvious he could not have cared less.

I honestly had low expectations going in because come on seriously, it's in North East Philly. As with any dim sum place, you judge the quality of the place by the ""Phoenix Claws"" aka chicken feet. If you don't eat chicken's feet during dim sum I have no respect for your opinion and your credibility is totally shot. 

The result was that it definitely wasn't as good as Philly's chinatown, yes not even Philly's chinatown. Something about the texture was off, maybe they didn't cook it long enough or used the wrong type of chicken or something but it's not too bad. To be brief, other items were good and more or less what you would expect from a dimsum place. The service was quick and they work hard like they actually give a shit.

Definitely will try again because of proximity and service, plus the lady called me handsome, yeah I'm shallow like that.  ^__~",2010-12-20 18:40:55,"{'food': ['dim sum', 'chicken feet'], 'drink': []}"

It contained pickles, and I am allergic to white vinegar, since I was so hungry, I pulled the pickles out and ate the burger anyhow.  I immediately noticed that the burger's only flavor was in the incredibly messy and watery sauce that they put on it.  This sauce was pouring down my arms, all the way down to my elbows and onto my pants.    After eating, as asked three ladies who were behind the counter, where the bathroom is, stating that I needed to wash  my hands and arms due to food bits and sauce all over them.  All three of them contorted their faces and looked at me as though I have three heads.  Then, with a rude and condescending tone, one of them stated ""We don't HAVE a bathroom, use this anti-bacterial stuff""   I politely declined the chemical-laden anti-bac salve and asked if they had a sink where I could wash the food and sauce off of my arms and hands.  They once again, contorted their faces, looking at me as though I am the crazy one.  Suddenly, another employee in a white t shirt instead of a green one emerges saying ""Yeah, I don't use the anti-bac  salve either, would you like a wet paper towel?""   I thought,  FINALLY, someone with some sense.  I smiled and said ""Yes, I would appreciate that, thank you""

The customer service was amazing from beginning to end! I called while at work to make a day of reservation for Saturday and was accommodated even after notifying them I would be late. The decor inside was amazing, the  only thing I would possibly add is a candle on the table for better lighting. As we were seated a server came over and greeted us,  he then notified us of the 7 course set menu and asked if we needed vegetarian options! We are both meat eaters and we're fine with the regular selections but I must say if I ever had a meal that would make me become a vegetarian again it would be the first dish! Amazing, deliciously seasoned/marinated vegetables with pita cooked to a level of perfection!  All the dishes where delicious and unique in their own way. The chicken was so tender and our server put the spicy sauce in the side since we were having a hard time deciding on the spicy or lemon chicken. They even let us have one lamb kebob and one beef, my boyfriend wished the lamb was seasoned more but he likes salt on everything, I was able to enjoy the cultures cuisine as it was served. The mint tea was perfectly sweetened and the dessert course of fresh ripe fruit and sweet baklava was the icing on the cake. We never wanted for anything the whole time because the servers were so on top of everything, one of the managers Samir even stopped by to speak to us! The 7 course meal was $28 per person when you bring wine (byob) and they add tax and 18% gratuity (well deserved + more). On Saturday they have a belly dancer that comes around for your entertainment and to make you feel emerged in beautiful Morocco without even leaving the country!

Two of us dining. We ordered two apps to share and an entree each. One app came soon, the other 20 minutes later. Barely minutes after the 2nd app arrived and we were still enjoying it (or trying to), one entree arrive, just one. A full five minutes later, as entree 1 gets cold (since my companion is gracious enough not to start without me), still no other entree. Waitress rushes by, we manage to catch her eye and ask where other entree is. She says she'll check, but after five minutes more hasn't come back. I get up from table and go to find out. Waitress sees me and look of ""uh-oh"" comes onto her face because she obviously forgot all about it. She gestures toward manager who starts to give me all sorts of excuses -- ""we're so busy, kitchen got backed up, it will be out soon"" -- and I say, well, yes, but my companion's dinner is now cold. So she says they'll bring him a new one along with mine. Which she herself does after a few more minutes but then slams it down onto our table, literally slams it down onto the table without a word of apology, no smile, no nothing -- and, by the way, no fork, since the waitress had cleared our forks with the apps. Meanwhile, our empty beer bottles sit on the table throughout the meal, as no staff have the sense to take them away, and a grimy, dirty candle-holder sits there, too, because, when we finally ask about a candle, we're told ""we ran out."" So, I figure you either walk a block to the dollar store nearby and buy some candles or you take the yucky candle holders off the tables.

All in a lousy experience. When entrees finally came, they were adequate, nothing special, same for the apps. Never again.

My boyfriend and I ended up going here for our anniversary at the end of February and were sort of underwhelmed by the food. It wasn't bad at all. It's just that the decor and the prices had me expecting something a little more memorable.   

To start off with, the place is cozy and charmingly lit. It's a great date place, for sure.  The server was very competent and reasonably friendly. 

For appetizers we had the yellowtail tartar, which had a nice flavor from them charring the top a little, and tasted fresh, but was not really that exciting otherwise.  I am not sure if this is due to the fact that we asked for everything without scallions, because my boyfriend can't eat them. We also got the special baby octopus appetizer. It wasn't bad; it just had a one-dimensional sesame oil flavor. 

We ordered the sushi platter for two and the Izumi roll (crabmeat, eel, cucumber, avocado, sesame seed and nori) and my boyfriend got an extra couple of pieces of ikura (salmon roe). The sushi was decent, but the only thing that stood out to me was the salmon. It tasted really high quality. The rest of the sushi was just okay, and the rice had a little too much vinegar in it.

Mediocre defines the food and service, can't comment on the bar or beers offered. Went with the specials, potato wedges and sliders, and also calamari from the apps. The potato wedges were a few roasted potatoes with seasoning a ketchup/spicy sauce in the side, bland and flavorless. The sliders were like little frozen patties, not freshly pulled or made, with a heavy mayo and slaw tipping that spilled everyone. Nothing unique or tasty about it. I like the fries, but it's a small portion. The calamari was a weird batter, definitely not fresh either. 

The hostess/server that served us couldn't even remember who ordered what drink, who ordered what dish, and didn't hand out the app plates to anyone at my table -- basically they could not handle the basics of being a server, severe pet peeves of mine when I got to eat out.  

This place wants to serve pub food, but they come up short and the service is lacking. I could see going back if I wanted a beer at the bar while waiting, but otherwise I wouldn't eat there again. 

The bathroom key and sign on the bathroom door  are a joke.

Everything we had was so fresh and prepared expertly. We started with a caprese salad. It was amazing, the tomatoes were so fresh and juicy and complemented with delicious mozzarella, red onions and roasted peppers with some mixed greens as well. This has to be the best caprese salad I've ever had. We also had the bruschetta, which was similar to the caprese salad but was also delicious. For entrees we had the penne alla vodka with chicken which again has to be the best I've ever tasted and shrimp scampi which had 6 large shrimp over risotto with a tasty lemon wine sauce. The shrimp were fresh and prepared perfectly. One of the people we were dining with had the stuffed veal chop which I tried and bet your bottom dollar I'll be ordering that next time. Ordinarily I wouldn't order dessert but we couldn't resist the cannoli, and you guessed it, hands down the best I've ever tasted and I've had more the my fair share of cannolis.

Even though the space is small, it isn't overly crowded, so you feel like you have space, even if at a small table.

We had the Korean Fried Chicken in Spicy Sauce.  These were awesome!  Perfectly juicy, crispy and the perfect amount of flavor and spice! he wings are pretty large too.  Make sure you order these when you come here!!

My friend couldn't have the bacon that came with it (she doesn't eat pork) and they were really awesome about putting it on the side so we could both enjoy the dish!

Bimbimbap-  We went with the Dolsot Bimbimbap option and OH MY!  SO YUMMY!!!!!!  This was so perfect because it was cold and rainy the night we came here and this HIT THE SPOT!  Utter perfection.  We got it with tofu and our server recommended the sizzling option because the rice gets crispy and the texture melds really nicely with the other veggies, he was so right!!!  I am so happy we went with his recommendation! As Natalie K. said in her review, (she is the friend I was with) we were told that the crunch of the rice you get with this dish is incomparable, and it is so true.  It tied the whole thing together.  I could not get enough!!! I am honestly salivating just thinking about it.  I also look forward to trying the other styles, but I would absolutely get this again!

Bulgogi Burger -After being told that this was voted the best burger in Philly, we had o try it.  SO Good! it is definitely one of the best burgers I have had in the city.  each item on this burger (marinated beef, green leaf lettuce, scallion salad, ssamjang mayo, homemade pickles, sesame bun), truly complimented each other for the perfect Korean style burger experience.

My girlfriend and I have been here a couple times now.  The first time was great, the second was just okay.  

The first time we got the wings, a mac and cheese burger and a couple of Yeunglings.  

Lets start with the beer-IT WAS GREAT!  Have you ever been somewhere that doesn't clean their tap lines? You can tell because the beer tastes skunky, and looks cloudy.  Well Cornerstone clearly cleans their lines, as the Yeungling was about the freshest, best tasting beer I'd ever had.  

The wings were very large and meaty.  Some of the largest wings I have ever had.   The wing sauce was spicy, and delicious.  Honestly, I'd say (this visit) they were some of the better wings I'd had.  

The burger was acceptable.  The patty was Definately a frozen patty, and the mac that came on it appeared to be easy mac.   We sat outside, and the waitress was very kind.  

The owner was there the whole time watching us though- and it felt almost invasive. 

The second time we went there my girlfriend got the French dip, and I got the wings.  French dip was very basic, just thick sliced grocery store roast beef, with some gravy and cheese on it.  

The wings this time were not nearly as good as the first time.  They were still large and meaty, but had less sauce, and were not as crispy.  

We will definitely be going back, the atmosphere is great, and this restaurant definitely has a lot of potential. I would suggest limiting the frozen products, and ensuring consistency in food prep to improve the restaurant.

Nyum La Hong, the green papaya salad, which we went for with medium spice, just trying to be cautious, but I think I definitely could've gone for spicy

Sah-Law Kah-Ree Mohn, curried chicken with lots of fresh veggies, especially celery, and rice
Cha Throp, purple eggplant with oyster sauce and we went with the pork option - this reminded me a lot of Thai sweet basil dishes I've had in the past and while it was tasty it was not the most unique in terms of our overall experience, but seriously it was tasty

Great news- bullfrog was on tap, Stillwater was on can. Who could stop us now? With heaps of food to go home to we started out with one of the two slices.

Slice would be an understatement- its a huge square cut in two triangles and amidst sat generous petals of sopressata looking like a elegant rose. What we bit into after bickering weeks about ""how orgasmic can this pizza be man?"" turned to a godly experience. Man the flavors, the dough, the carbs and the goodness of cheese and the leeks! Ugh-so so good and I don't even care about pizza. The dough is light, airy, soft -painted with cheese that was not greasy at all but packed with leek goodness! I eat no porky but am smart enough to know that stuff tastes heavenly. So the inevitable happened and we ordered the other slice with garlic, spinach, mozzarella and parmesan I believe. Holy you know what! Even better- the garlic goodness and spinach cocooned in the gooey cheese. All the flavors and textures were in balance, cant wait to try the neopolitan style!

I'll get right to the chase, this place is a bit too hyped up, and quite possibly the worst restaurant layout I have ever experienced.  Sure the decor is appealing, doesn't feel too pretentious, considering the clientele that visits this establishment, but really.. Have the take out/standing room/cashier jammed right up near the door and 3 ft away from a big communal table, whoever designed this place needs a nice ol' slap back to reality.

We had a small wait, not a big deal at all.  My wife and I grabbed a beer, and I must say I was very happy to see Six Point Sweet Action, but I was not as impressed with the $7 price tag, I can deal though.

On to the pizza - we did the Salsiccia.  Now, I must preface this with the fact that we have experienced Vetri Pizzeria once before.  There was an hour wait, so we just ordered take out.  I forget what kind of pizza we ordered, but that doesn't matter.  What does matter is how incredibly floppy and soggy the dough was when we had walked back to our car and dug right in.  This was so underwhelming, we were extremely disappointed.  But, we gave them the benefit of the doubt and vowed to come back after a couple months once they figured out all the nuances, hence our visit tonight.  

So you can imagine we had high expectations now that they were a few months in.  And guess what happened when the pizza came and we each grabbed our first slice?  Pull it up off the plate and immediately half the pizza slice just slumps down.  Completely soggy, completely unacceptable by anyone's standard.  Now maybe this is the style, but I can't imagine any pizza should be this soggy.  And certainly not for that price tag and reviews this place gets.  Hence why I said up front, this place is way overhyped.

I'm giving 2 stars for them having a nice atmosphere minus the bs layout, and the flavor of the pizza was not bad, but frankly not any different from the rest of the ""high-end"" pizza shops around the city.  As some others have stated, price is incredibly inflated for what you get.  Being a Vetri establishment, we expected to be transported to a whole new level of pizza but in the end were left disappointed...again.  Hopefully they get their act together soon for their patron's sake, but I'm afraid we won't be back to find out!

The genius of grilling the falafel patties goes without saying.  (2) The halva is wonderful-- one of my favorite dessert treats.  Just don't think about it or ever look at nutritional information.

I ordered a washington square west pizza (added meatballs). Just okay. Nothing exciting or memorable. Not very flavorful (don't be fooled by the ""truffle"" mushrooms). The crust was subpar - not crispy enough. I literally don't even remember it enough to write more. 
This is the quintessential place to get a slice when you don't care and have no time. (Sorry but true).
They are BYO and have nice decor and seating though.
Also the service is meh. I called my order in no problem and was told 25 min. Arrived at the 20 min mark and only then did they start to make my pizza. Seriously? When I asked, they said they had oven troubles. Fine. I said I would be back then. Waitress said it would take 10 min, recited my number to me, and said she would call me. I came back 15 min later and the pizza was ready, sitting on top of the oven. Thanks for NOT calling me. In total, the pizza took 40 min from call time to in my hands.
Prices are okay...I did get a pricey pizza with $3 meatball = $21, but for that price I may as well get a heavenly truffle pizza at birra or a fancy pizza at nomad roman.

We started with some maki rolls which we were very pleased with.  We tried the shrimp tempura make which was excellent.  Nice and spicy, but not uncomfortably spicy.  I don't always like eating shrimp due to its texture, but this shrimp had been tempura'd to perfection.  We also ordered the hamachi maki, which was not quite as tasty as the spicy shrimp tempura, but still very good.  I thought the yellow tail was some of the best tasting yellow tail I've ever had.
The house salad I ate was good.  Nothing spectacular - but hey, its just the house salad.  The ginger dressing on it had a slightly different taste too it than other ginger dressings that I've had.  I didn't like this one as much, but I wouldn't call it bad either.
I felt my entree was pretty disappointing.  I had the wasabi crusted filet mignon with goat cheese ravioli and polenta cake.  I felt my filet was very bland, and I really can't even say I tasted much wasabi at all.  The meat itself was good - very tender and juicy, just not tasty.  When I read the menu it lead me to believe that I was to have goat cheese (I imagined it lightly scattered across the dish) and ravioli, as in two separate items.  I was lead to believe this because in the menu there is a comma between ""goat cheese"" and ""ravioli"", however upon receiving my dish the only goat cheese to be found was in the ravioli.  I think had the goat cheese been loose around the dish it may have livened up the filet.
Dessert was decent creme brulee and a completely delectable strawberry shortcake.  And the strawberry shortcake was *huge*!!  We barely got through half of it.  It was pretty good, but what made it excellent was the vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry sauce they had spread across the plate.  It was very good.
Nice selection of drinks, the cocktails were very good!
Service wasn't too bad.  I did get somewhat annoyed at one point when one of the waitresses decided to lecture the host for seating someone in the wrong section as they stood next to my table - she seemed really aggravated about it.  It was an ongoing lecture which a few employees also decided to give their 2 cents.  I think it could have been done somewhere else where the patrons didn't have to hear it.
The ambiance of this place was lacking.  There really wasn't much of any to be honest, and the choice of music seemed kind of odd to me.  If I remember correctly it was older rock?

My company orders from here all the time so I thought there would be no problems. The delivery guy was 15 minutes late, number one. Number two, he was argumentative and telling me that I have to pay even though I gave the credit card number over the phone. I had to go get my boss because it was his card. I ended up getting him for nothing, because then the rude delivery guy tells me I have to call for them run it through. The person on the phone said that she had all the information already and there should be no problem. The delivery guy is still standing there yelling at me to read her the invoice number, which again she already has. He then yells, ""I didn't tell you nothing!"" I hand him MY cell phone because I'm tired of arguing. He asks for some guy (I'm assuming his supervisor) who told him the same thing, that I had already paid.  According to him, the girl was new and she doesn't know anything because she's ""Chinese."" What that had to do with anything is beyond me. I understood her just fine. Is this a cake order or presidential campaign? Then he said, ""Enjoy the cake"" and scampered off with no apology whatsoever for his lateness and rudeness. As if that wasn't enough, they just called me a few minutes ago to tell me that the credit card didn't go through because they had all of the numbers wrong.

Chicken with different spices and flavors but you will have to wait until after 10am or was it 11am. We were here really early and it was a waiting game. So we wait with coffee in one hand and a few donuts in the other. No really, a few donuts because eating just one would be stupid. The creativity and presentation of these donuts are amazing. I liked the grapefruit donut in the way it looked and  tasted it Citrus-y and sweet and not as tart as you would imagine a grapefruit would have been. Many donuts to choose from and different glazes but the grapefruit one stood out the most to me which is why I remember it so vividly.

Went to this place last year in July as it was on Carrie's bookmarks.I doubt it was the fried chicken with many different flavors to choose from was the reason for our visit. Besides the GPS directions being called out, all we get is Federal Donuts. Who knew anything about fried chicken besides the locals who come here all the time. There's only four seats so take your food outside. There's a long red bench to share but you don't have to share your donuts. Forget about trying to find parking. You can always park in front of the fire hydrant like this lady did. She walked in like a boss, ordered, waited, grabbed her order, walked out, hopped in her car and left. Just make sure you carpool, one hops out and one waits in the car or circle the blocks. Just share your chicken so you can have more donuts.

The oyster shooters were by far the best shooters that I've had in a long time (surprised). There raw oyster was balanced with the right amount of alcohol. I was warned ahead of time that sushi rolls were not that impressive, but I ordered a special roll anyways. Let's just say I was not impressed (not surprised). A heavy reliance on sauces, and the seaweed used to wrap the roll was not crispy. When ordering sushi here, one should request for fresh wasabi (surprised). This isn't readily available everywhere, and it adds a different kind of heat to the sushi. 

In all honesty, if you're going to To-Kai you should just order everything from its Appetizers section and just disregard everything else, but even the Appetizer section can leave you wanting more. The tuna pizza was thoroughly enjoyed at my table, but personally, there was once again a heavy reliance on sauce for this app. The kani salad was really good - refreshing with a nice kick. The avocado blossom was the highlight for me. It packed some nice flavors while maintaining some textural components (everything was just mush). The baked mussels were so-so.

Came last year for hubby's birthday totally missed their serving hours.  Waited an entire year to come again and wouldn't you know it was pouring down rain.  

I mean we really worked to get to this place.

And it was meh although it seemed popular.

Why didn't I think of that?  Call it small plates, charge $10-$16 a plate with a tablespoon of food and get rich. Five cents worth of collard greens.  The guy is a genius.   The place is tiny but really nice inside.  Despite other reviews, our waiter was nice.  The servings are tiny, but the food so rich, we actually couldn't finish our food.  I wasn't really disappointed.  We eat out a lot so we're all about discovering new places.

What got me was the drink.  Don't charge me $12 for a drink and not make it from entirely fresh ingredients.  From a mix?  Really?  No, no, that's bad.  When I order an expensive drink that barely has any alcohol in it at least use fresh lemons, fresh mint, fresh whatever.  Do. not. make. the. drinks. from. bottled. mixes.  bad bad bad.  Mixes never taste like the real thing and have an awful after taste.

Yeah, but I really would recommend visiting at least once.  We actually enjoyed ourselves.  I had two beers and that premade drink and did get a nice buzz.  Two people and it ran around $80-$90 before tip.  We pretty much had a taste of everything on the menu.
