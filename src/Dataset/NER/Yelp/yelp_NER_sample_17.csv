rgSuonZ-4AmHlIWJuPyHtg,YmfGjqIfGeDkfJVdsmg29Q,EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ,1,2,2,2,"Update -- Sadly I will not be returning to Village Whiskey. From the Philadelphia Inquirer:
""[Jose Garces' Village Whiskey] had more risk factors for foodborne illness than 99 percent of establishments inspected in 2014. [...] Seven inspections in a row at [Village Whiskey] found multiple serious violations, such as a food-prep employee's working with a cut finger, raw meat stored over produce, and egg salad held at temperatures hospitable to microbes.""

---------------------------------------------

I've always believed that if you're going to do a hamburger, you do it right.

Village Whiskey does it right.

VW's ambience is lively with an upscale vibe. But the space is cozy to say the least, so expect a wait if you just walk in. The menu itself is very short, so if you don't like hamburgers, fries, and whiskey, you should probably dine elsewhere. Or better yet return to whatever sad, burger-hating voodoo cult you hail from.

Soon, you'll find yourself sitting in front of a giant bun piled so high with hot beef and fixin's that you won't be able to pick it up neatly. You'll wonder to yourself, ""How did I get myself into this jam?"" before realizing that you're in 'Murica and that's the way we do it here.

The one to get is, of course, the namesake Whiskey Burger. The word ""no"" doesn't exist when a luscious colossus of magical maple-bourbon glazed cipollini, applewood smoked bacon, rogue bleu cheese, and foie gras-topped beef is staring you right in the face. Yeah, you're throwing down an obscene amount of money for a hamburger. And yeah, it's damn good. Village Whiskey's signature Duck Fat Fries are thick, dark, and full of dense potato-y goodness. They are also heavily seasoned, so you might want to have a taste before you ask for a salt shaker. Mmm! As far as beverage pairings go, I happen to like whiskey but next time I'll wash everything down with a beer instead.

If you're looking for something a little lighter on the palate, you might want to try just taking a nap. BUT if you're in the mood for something decadently sweet, then may I recommend the French Toast? Deep-fried mouthfuls of nut-creme-filled brioche toast, tart berry jam, and toasted pecans topped with fresh berries and whipped ricotta cream. Sweet tooth: 1, stomach room leftover: 0.

I'll take that nap now, thank you very much.",2015-12-10 08:08:05,"{'food': ['Whiskey Burger', 'Duck Fat Fries'], 'drink': []}"

However, they are conveniently located RIGHT across my apartment. That is pretty cool and I was excited to see a Thai restaurant so close by, even though there are already quite a few Thai places in Center City.

The fact that they set up shop in a nice little neighborhood is attractive, but I feel like the novelty of this place stops there. 

The inside looks pretty lively most of the time which is inviting but the decor and set-up is rather plain and almost cafeteria-like in nature with its ordinary red picnic-tables and somewhat bare walls that even display an elementary school style fire-bell on the wall. 

The tables have no place settings, no coasters and no glass top either, although they are polished well.

Tables are somewhat close together but not so much so that it's annoying. The table all the way to the far back left corner however is poorly located right in front of the cash register. Not only do you get to hear ever other table being rang up while you sit there but if you're lucky you get to overhear some of the very unprofessional comments and discussion of the staff who think that no one can hear them. No matter how friendly they are to you and how well you're served, they lose a little of that customer-service friendliness when right after they say please/thank you, they walk two feet away from you and stand there swearing and making comments you'd hear on the street. Just because they aren't aimed at anyone in particular makes no difference, it's just plain rude and unprofessional. 

As for the food- it's what you would expect of a random place like this: It wasn't the best Thai food I've ever had and it wasn't the worst either. At this point it's so widely available I feel like any place that is just NOW opening a Thai restaurant needs to bring a little something extra to the table.

(Let's see how many times I say (type?) burger in this review).

My burger of choice? Village burger + cheddar + avocado + bacon + fried egg. Yes, the burger is $12 and yes, my additions are a whopping $9, and yes, I don't care. When you receive this holy burger in all its glory, it truly is amazing. Look at it from all sides. The burger is cooked to perfection, the avocado is ever so gently laid upon the cheese. The bacon? Crisp and beautiful. And the fried egg. It knows that it will cover your burger and  keep teasing your taste buds with every bite. Oh, and it comes with pickle. A very jealous pickle since the burger gets all the attention. If you instagram this burger, you'll get more likes than your best selfie. #yourewelcome

To complete your experience, get the tots and duck fat fries. I mean, since you already spent $$$ on your burger, why not go all out? The cocktails are interesting, and I've tried a few of them. But let's not get too crazy here. My review is about the burger. One of the best I've tried in Philly.

Dessert was also a disappointment. We ordered the Bread Pudding and the Banana Cream pie. I don't think the bread pudding could have been any drier than it was. The Banana Cream pie was also very unimpressive. I will not be returning to Ruth's Chris. I would much rather find myself at Capital Grille or Barclay Prime.

When I called I spoke to the owner Sam who told me that they would be open and that they were a small local place so to get there early. We did get there early and had a couple of drinks from a friendly bartender named Kelsey and some food before the game started. The Philly cheese steak grinder was excellent. Served on a fresh, not soggy roll with the perfect amount of onion and whiz in each bite. We also ordered the friend pickle chips with house made ranch. Again the portion was just the right size for sharing. 

Just before the game started the DJ arrived. He played music of all different types and eras. I heard everything from Migos to Taylor Dane to Frank Sinatra. It wasn't too loud, but it was loud enough to be heard but not too loud that you couldn't talk to the person next to you. 

Once the game started the music went off and the TV volume went up which is great especially for an important game like this one. There were drink specials and a great halftime buffet. 

Liberty Bar & Grill reminds me of my local watering hole from back home where the owner is engaging and knows his patrons. The bartenders are friendly and attentive and the atmosphere makes you feel right at home.

I was looking for places in center city that I could reserve for a birthday party. Ariana came up as a restaurant that would be able to accomodate 30-40 people and allow us to eat dinner and play music afterwards. At a price point of $15 per person before tax and tip ($19/person after tax and included gratuity), we thought this would be an amazing bargain. 

The food: Quite bland. The Chicken Corma, Lamb in Red Lentils, and Spinach dishes were just ok. The Saffron Pilaf was oddly sweet and undercooked. The bread that is included with the meal was just alright. 

The Service: When I placed my deposit to reserve the restaurant, we were told that the restaurant closes at 10PM and that we would have the space from 10:30PM to 2AM. On the night of the party, there were still multiple groups eating at the restaurant until 11:30pm. Then, once those individuals left, Ariana's staff served us mediocre food with very tiny portions (e.g. tiny dishes containing 3 chunks of chicken to split among 6 people). We had to ask multiple times for them to bring out more food because people were still hungry. Then at 1:20AM, they tried to tell us that they will actually close at 1:30 and that we would have to leave 30 mins earlier than what was initially agreed to.

They also mentioned that we would be able to play our own music from an iphone or ipod, however their outdated Ps3/blueray machine doesnt even recognize the iphone 5. I used an old Ipod nano and after about 20 mins, the staff changed the music to afghani music videos and told us to dance to that instead. They did this multiple times in the night. On top of that, some of the male staff at Ariana made my female friends uncomfortable by hitting on them.

The only chink in the armor of this otherwise bulletproof northeast cheesesteak stalwart is its long distance from center city.  I remember taking a bus here once when it was rainy, cold and wet.   Back in the day, I could make such journeys, but now my whole body aches after a couple walks in miserable weather!

Having eaten nothing but a few Kraft singles and crackers all day, I was eagerly awaiting this meal.

But back to the review.   I was surprised after walking in the cold, and the wet to come across a small little place that was surprisingly spick and span.   There was a menu on the wall, and it described other types of sandwiches such as mushroom italian meatball cheesesteaks and other gobbledygook, but I was there for one thing and one thing only.   

When the sandwich came out, it was everything I was hoping it to be.    Warm, succulent, steaming hot and delicious.   They certainly weren't niggardly when it came to stuffing the perfectly crusty roll full of delicious meat, onions, and cheese product.

My mother had come here with her coworkers previously and wanted me to go with her so I accompanied her to see how this place was. Not sure why the interior of the restaurant is so dark, not sure what the joint is trying to accomplish with that. However, I will say that the way the restaurant works is rather unique. You make a reservation for a certain time, show up with your party, and are served five(?) different courses of food. The nice part is that it's one flat fee per person though I believe it was cheaper when I came here ($25 per person ... has probably increased since then to $35 [what I've been eyeing from other reviews]). I will say that the food here is rather fantastic. As I've never had Moroccan food before, it was certainly a unique experience. The three way salad was one of my favorite dishes here ... there's just something wonderful about the combination of the ingredients and honestly, I don't think I've had my mouth as happy as it was eating down this dish. I also really liked the meat dishes, particularly the cumin chicken and the lamb. Both were on the tender side (huge stamp of approval) and were wonderful to chow down. On the down side, the fruit probably wasn't the freshest I've had ... which was a tad disappointing, as I'm a huge fan of fruit. Also, gratuity is added on automatically ... which I guess wasn't too surprising. Still it would have been much more understandable had I had a decent-sized group (5+ in my mind), but whatever. Overall, a good place to get some great food and a different dining experience.

I guess the reviews I've read and received through word of mouth had made an impact on me, so I clearly had high expectations!  I was expecting a wonderful hand-selected wine list, a handful of obscure beers from around the world and a menu of small plates and apps that could make me want to visit over and over in an attempt to try everything on the menu.

What I wasn't really expecting was the five star attentive wait staff. I now know, for the next time, that I can be comfortable letting my server pick a fantastic wine for the evening to partner with the meal.  I think there was a mutual decision that the wine list was a bit too extensive to try and pick something ourselves so we went for the (only slightly less overwhelming) beer list so we could get to chatting as soon as possible.  

For starters she had the Saison Dupont and I had the Nuova Mattina.  Both are farmhouse style unfiltered ales, the former from Belgium and the later from Italy - yes! Italy.  It was wonderful.  We then moved on to the Allagash White and the Tripel Karmeliet.  Four down and about thirty to go!  Again, the waitstaff was wonderful.  Tria is the sort of place where they come around and inconspicuously refill your glass for you and remove the bottle from your table.  Attentive and friendly but not in an interruptive at-your-table-every-sixty-seconds sort of way.

If you hadn't noticed, appetizers are all the rage these days.  I recently read an article were the author was encouraging you to be comfortable with going to a restaurant and ordering one, two or three apps for your main meal.  The chef typically has much less of a plate to convince you that they're THE man / woman therefore you're going to get a greater mouthful of splendor from an appetizer than you may from an entree.  This is apparent in the city of Philadelphia and Tria is one of a few in the leading pack.  As a matter of fact, although our entrees were very good, it was the appetizers that swept us off our feet and took us for a scenic flight from Italy to Switzerland.   

Our dining began with two appetizers.  Poached black mission figs stuffed with gorgonzola over prosciutto and wild mushroom and raclette fondue served with toasted baguette slices.  This was the first time I had heard of raclette cheese and learned (from my date) that this is a very typical Swiss meal whereby they let a half wheel of cheese get all warm and happy and gooey by an open fire and they serve it with gherkins and hot tea.  Right, well this was in a little souffle dish and it had taken commanding control of any ""wild"" mushroom that would try to escape!  This was one of the most remarkable tastes I have ever come across.  Again, our five star waitstaff, Stephanie I believe, was super attentive and brought over some additional toasted baguette to finish off the remaining fondue.  

One of the beauties of Tria is you get the feeling you should be exploring what the owners have selected as part of their extensive menu.  More over, you know you can't go wrong with much of anything.  This is a testament to the management and their passion for quality ingredients and beverages from around the world.  Tria, I look very much forward to seeing you again in the near future.  With your very reasonable prices, I'm sure that we will become wonderful friends and spend many happy nights together.",2008-06-11 22:12:42,"{'food': ['poached black mission figs stuffed with gorgonzola over prosciutto and wild mushroom', 'raclette fondue served with toasted baguette slices'], 'drink': []}"

Pound for pound and dollar for dollar Essene has a better selection of vegan and vegetarian ingredients than the Whole Foods a few blocks away on South Street...in my opinion that is. For the hell of it I stroll through the aisles when picking up some fruit or a lunchtime snack and I find a completely different selection of ""substitution"" products, cereals and I even discovered a new addition of vegan scrapple! 

Their vegetable and fruit selection is a fraction the size of the larger marts but as far as I could see all of their produce is organic and a lot of products are local as well.

So why don't I shop there more? Like many others I find that Essene's prices are a little too high on some of the items I frequently purchase, so I find myself heading back towards South Street where I can save a few more dollars. I have to say, though, that their lunchtime selection at the salad bar has more of a variety compared to Whole Foods, but be cautious, it's all meat free.

I was rooting for you!  I even chose you over the Dutch Eating Place today, but unfortunately, that won't happen again.

A friend and I stopped in for brunch, and we were super hungry.  After a brief wait, we were seated, and our waiter came over.   Our waiter was not friendly AT all - plain and simple.  We just ignored his rudeness and ordered our drinks - I opted for the fresh squeezed orange juice.  That juice tasted like fresh squeezed orange water, with a hint of lemon... :-(.    I ordered two eggs, scrambled hard, with scrapple fried hard, buttered challah and the onion and cheese latke.  When our food came out, mine was just barely warm.  After checking with my friend, and her assuring me that hers was hot, I signaled for our waiter.  I told him that my food wasn't hot at all, and he asked me what wasn't hot.  I told him none of it was.  By this time I was pretty annoyed, because not only was our waiter rude, but my food was cold and I was still VERY hungry.  He returned about 8 minutes later with a new plate, but by that point I didn't even want it.  I ate my scrapple, latke and a piece of my toast, but I wasn't impressed with anything but the latke.

Service:   Our waiter had a mustache that either meant he was a hipster or has a second job at Franklin Fountain ;)  He was nice and didn't mind that it took us a long time to figure out what we wanted to order.  Attentive but not overly so.

Food:  This is the real reason we came here, the Yelp reviews demanded that we visit.  The beer menu gave lots of information about the flavor, body, glass shape, alcohol content, etc.  I wouldn't recommend the belgian beer that is currently on the menu, but I really loved the abita andygator.

I split a Khyber burger and a fried chicken po boy with one of my dining mates.  I asked for the burger medium rare and it came out medium   The flavor and texture was good.  The fried chicken po boy had vibrant flavors, but the chicken was a little tough and dry.  Sweet potato fries - yummy (though honestly I have never met a sweet potato fry that I didn't like).

The number of sushi restaurants in Philadelphia seem to be endless so this was my first time here.  We were immediately seated since we came around 4pm.

We started with the Kani salad and rock shrimp as our appetizer.  The rock shrimp was lightly batter with tempura with a normal sized shrimp good enough.  We ordered four rolls (2 specialty rolls and 2 regular rolls).  One of the specialty roll was the france which is basically shrimp tempura roll to some extent.  The other roll I forgot the name but it was spicy salmon with shrimp wrapped on the outside (I enjoyed it).  The other 2 regular rolls were spicy tuna and some other I can't recall.

We came here for Center City Restaurant Week and dined off the RW menu.  Also made the reservation only a week before dining and requested a window seat with no avail.  (Didn't expect to get a window seat after reading that you need to reserve a couple of months in advance for one)

The decor was simple, elegant, and with a touch of dated animal print.
The service was mediocre....mediocre is kind...we didn't have utensils at the time our entree was served. Not too classy for a classy restaurant.  I will exclude names, however our server was sweet in the beginning and then lacked any attentiveness throughout our meal.  Another server was excellent at keeping an eye on our table however, and then I would see him go over to our ""primary"" server and tell him what we requested.

On to the food....
FIRST COURSE:
The Steakhouse Salad - Heads up that there's no steak in this salad.  Nothing fancy, but a deconstructed salad with some olives, bacon, hearts of palm and with a blue cheese dressing and mustard dressing that tasted pretty good combined. 
Overall I feel like the flavors were too much and they really could have kept it more simple.  Presentation was nice though.

Short Rib Terrine - not a fan of jellied, chilled short rib.  Again this one had a mustard sauce and served with arugula salad.

SECOND COURSE:
Much better than the first course dishes however...like Janet Jackson sings...""you don't know what you got til it's gone""...and what we didn't have were utensils to eat our food with!  ""OOPS be right back!"", says the runner. And server (number 2...?) comes to the rescue.

Hunnie got the Sliced Prime Rib + Short Rib Duo - really loved the sweet potato (mash) that the prime rib sat on top of.  The juices from the meat and sweet potato combo was delicious.  Prime rib was dry.  The short rib was delicious but didn't amaze me.

Roasted Duck Breast was my dish, and I'd give that dish 4 stars because of the crispy duck skin piece that was delicious. Duck was tough and chewy.  The wild mushroom risotto croquette was delicious. The risotto was a bit sticky which I wasn't used to but I liked the crispy top of the croquette. Really nice textures all along this dish and the flavors went very well together.

DESSERT!!! aka THIRD COURSE:
Two options to choose from so of course we ordered one of each.  A bit disappointed yet again.  Presentation on the Dark Chocolate Tart was nice and I loved the caramelized bananas, but the dark chocolate itself was nothing too great. Wish it was more bitter, which would've went well with the mousse and would have given it more flavor when eaten together.

Blood Orange Parfait was the other third course/ dessert option.  I love the texture of the mini tapioca pearls but this really fell flat of anything special.  The combination of it all tasted like sherbet ice cream (which I probably would've preferred instead)

I would come back here for the delicious cocktail that I happily gulped up and highly recommend - ""Trifecta 37"" is the name.  If you don't know me already, I LOVE tequila and gin.  This one consisted of...  Bombay gin, pineapple, basil, lime + chile.  The chile is an oil that adds a nice kick to the drink.  

I also may come back to try the lobster mac & cheese.

After many visits, I always left feeling like a victim of the best PR team in Philly. They pay for publicity and it shows. The food, in everyone of my experinces here, has been just ok. I order the lobster bisque the first time I was there around their opening and it was good, every other time I've been back it seems to get worse. 
The burger in my opionion is not that good. It's a bacon cheeseburger. That's it. It's really nothing special, everytime I've ate this burger ( 4 times now ) it's been way overcooked and extremely salty. At first I thought it maybe was the bacon, tried the bacon, and actually the bacon needed salt. So I told my self not to order the burger next time back. 
I've tried to like this place. But the last time I went really made my mind up for me. I sat down with the girl and some friends after drinking over priced middle of the road beers, glanced at the menu and saw meatloaf. Now I'm not the person to seek out meatloaf, but I figured if anyone can make a bangin meatloaf their chef can. So holding my excitement back I ordered the meatloaf in anticapation of what was ahead of me. I was thinking best meatloaf ever. So the server arrives to the table and places the food down in front of everyone, and I front of me he lies a pulled pork sandwich. I'm confused, the table is confused after hearing me order the meatloaf and talking about how it may erase the memories of horrid meatloafs past. After 10 minutes of sitting there with no server to be found I ate this pile of garbage they called pulled pork. I never said anything out of fear of what I may said to the server, I was extremely pissed. 

That being said I will never walk through those doors again. After spending hundreds of dollars in this establishment, I give up. Hopefully the money I have spent here will go to one more month of PR. They will surely need it, without the hype this place is just another bar. Nothing more.

Lucky for us the place was empty and we got seats at the bar, right in front of one TV. Bartenders had no idea there were Super Bowl specials, and I had to pull up the website to prove it to him. We had to ask for menus, and flag them down every time we needed a refill. Just awful service.
We also had an incident when paying the bill, where the guy seemed confused about multiple payment methods. So he left a pile of $80 cash on the counter, and put the balance on the credit card.

We were in the mood to try some fresh, simply prepared seafood and went out of our way to Ippolito's for lunch. And it was it worth it! Obviously, Ippolito's is first and foremost a seafood market that has a wide variety of seafood available to take home. They also have a decent selection of fresh produce and dairy items and have now started carrying high quality meats. But what brought us to Ippolito's is the fact that they also serve meals there, as they have a small counter as well as a few tables where you can enjoy some of the freshest seafood in town. OK.. so now the secret is out. Ippolito's is apparently well known for their ahi tuna steak sandwich but we tried a few fish platters. What a great concept...you get to choose any type of fish they have and tell them how you want it prepared (grilled, broiled, fried, etc). And of course, the seafood could not be any fresher. We enjoyed some grilled salmon and blue fish, and some broiled red snapper, all of which were perfectly cooked. The platters each come with two sides and we had several types of cole slaw (try the apple pear version) as well as roasted potatoes, french fries, and greens. You can also get oysters freshly shucked there as well as things like soft shell crabs in season and I get the impression that if they have it, it can be cooked up for you. The staff (especially the young female cook with blonde hair) could not have been any friendlier and were helpful and made us feel at home. Needless to say we will be coming back very soon. Hopefully  word will not get around too fast so we can still snag some seats. Yes. It's that good.",2013-08-18 20:58:57,"{'food': ['salmon', 'blue fish', 'red snapper'], 'drink': []}"

As usual, it was a busy day at the Comcast Center, and fortunately, LaScala's wasn't nearly as crowded as some of the other places in that food court. That's good to know especially when you are limited on time. If you're going here in the first place, you probably are.

They are particularly fast if you are just getting pizza. It's already made and they have this toaster conveyor belt thingy - I know it has a name and I don't know what it's called - that they heat it up on. So if you are ordering pizza they will literally have you out in around 5 minutes - depending on how long the line is. If you are getting something else, you will wait a little while. Under normal circumstances, it wouldn't feel like you wait that long, but when slices of pizza are flying out of the oven, and people are coming and going, it seems like a bit of a wait.

From the outside you'd probably be weary of entering, as was I. The inside is covered (walls and ceiling) with colorful Moroccan fabrics and from the ceiling (aka: draped fabric) hangs a few Moroccan lanterns. The tables (circular cushioned benches around a small circular table) are low and line the walls.

Before eating you everyone at the table puts there hands in the center over a basin and the water pours warm water of them. This is preparation for dinner because you are eating with your hands. For those who'd rather not but were still dragged here (or scared 1st dates) , they will also give you utensils. (Boo!)

I was weary of the food as well, but I loved it all (I have to admit I wasn't sure what exactly we were ordering at some part). You can get a dinner of eight courses for $25 a person. Get this.

No one in my party tried the famous Village burger or the duck fat fries. However, we're all big fans despite not being Village Whiskey's target demographic. 

They don't take reservations here, so wait times are variable. I personally wouldn't even try on a Thursday-Saturday night because I'm an impatient person when it comes to food. The space is also super small for such a popular spot: it's basically a glorified hallway. The minimal decor, sleek bar, and white subway tiles avoid giving the place a cluttered feel, however. The tables are very tiny and close together, meaning you usually end up squeezed next to another party no matter where you sit. We went on a rainy evening, so outdoor seating (probably the best seats in the house) was out of the question. 

As for food, we got:
-The tater tots: fluffy little clouds of fried mashed potatoes. crispy on the outside, light and smooth on the inside. so. good.
-The pickled local red and golden beets: served with rich and creamy whipped ricotta, black olive tapenade, and sourdough bread. Beet lovers rejoice! The natural, fresh flavors of the beets shone through perfectly, reminding me why I adore beets so very much. Probably my favorite component of the meal, actually.
-The lobster mac: my seafood-eating dining companions really savored it
-The veggie burger: I liked it quite a bit, but I wanted to like it more because of all the hype. The patty was a little dry and crumbly on the outside, but the inside of the patty, paired with the pickled red cabbbage, was perfectly quenched. The burger just needs a bit of moisture to balance the dryness of the lentils. I suspect that it would have been more balanced with the guacamole as well, but I can't eat it because I am allergic to avocado (bummer, I know).

Been at Penn for three years and I come here a couple of times each week for a quick breakfast/lunch/I'm hungry moment.

Bui's has some pretty solid specialty sandwiches (e.g. Ms. Bui), but none of them beat the simple perfection that is their bacon, egg, and cheese. If there is one specialty sandwich I would recommend though, it's the Turkey BLT...the amount of turkey bacon they put in there seems extremely generous.

Quick tip: If you have no idea what the dude is asking you after you place your order, he's most likely asking if you want ""salt, pepper, ketchup"" on your sandwich. :)",2013-07-03 07:21:12,

I have been hearing about this place for some time now though various media coverage.   I did not arrive there until 2pm in the afternoon, which led to anticipation and anxiety.  Both of these emotions were from hoping they were open, not sold out of donuts or Fried Chicken, and hoping that the line would not be too long.   They were sold out of their Fancy donuts, but they had plenty of their Hot Fresh donuts, which come in three flavors: Appollonia, Indian Cinnamon, and Vanilla-Lavender.  I was super geeked that they still had chicken.   

I ordered each flavor of the Hot Fresh donuts and I ordered a half of chicken, which consist of a breast split in half, one drumstick, and one thigh.  You have the option of putting a dry rub or a wet rub on your chicken.  Torn between the dry rub and the wet rub, I went with my first inclination and ordered the harrissa dry rub. 

On the surface, chicken and donuts seem like an odd combination, but they pair together well, just like chicken and waffles.   The fried chicken is Korean-style, which made it super crunchy, and the donuts were warm and delicious.  I can see why this place is so popular.

Pros: waitress was super knowledgeable about drinks. Hostesses were very friendly and accommodating. The food that we did receive was delicious (regardless if it was not what was advertised.) Ambiance is a lot of fun. Tried to make up for mishap. 


Cons: Our meal took 2 hours. Our waitress seemed overextended and stressed out. They ran out of 2 of the options from the Restaurant Week menu.

3 of us went to R2L for an amazing dining experience last night.
And even though there were some problems (big ones) with service, the exquisite food more than made up for it.

Danny & Zaga - you ""make your mamas proud"".
That semi-open kitchen was running very nicely.  Your garnish chef, poultry man and line crew were in a good groove.

Daniel Stern's newest creation is in a gorgeous, dimly lit (and on a hoppin' Saturday night - very loud but still, surprisingly, comfortable) space.  The light fixtures, sculpture, bathrooms, stainless steel salt & pepper shakers (unused and unneeded) even the jacket of the wine list - all set off the gorgeous floor to ceiling views of the city.

Our lovely female bartender mixed us excellent drinks (brandy soaked cherries that are simply divine - I could eat a handful easily) and explained the menu while we waiting for our friend to arrive.

After we were seated our new and VERY nervous waiter (I think he had been there 3-4 days) explained even more.  We forgave him for using his notecards.

What was not so forgivable was the service snafu.

2 of the 3 of us ordered apps which were brought in short order after a delicious house-made bread.  The apps - which I truly recommend (those here with low food reviews - man, I think you may have ordered the wrong things) were the steak tartare (served in a rough chopped with plenty of shallots.  I ordered mine ""not too spicy"" and it was delicious.  Accompanied by crispy toasts with sort sort of butter (I think she said ""beet butter"" but it must have been golden beets as the color was a pale yellow).

My friend was not yet even finished his appetizer - crabcakes (which I did not try but he liked them and they looked great.) and his entree and side were brought out.

Then we sat.

And sat.

And finally said - ""go ahead and eat it while it's still hot"".  So he started to eat his (signature dish) Veal 5-6 ways.  So fabulous.  YOU MUST TRY DAN STERNS famous veal plate.  Accompanied by crisp butter-tossed broccoli florets.

So while he ate and my husband and I sat there and stared around - I said ""This is a screw up"". 

And, indeed it was.

First our (now petrified) young server came to apologize.  Next the manager came and said that our entrees were ""3 minutes away"" and apologized and said that they would do something ""special"" to make it up to us.

When our entrees did arrive - they were so worth the wait.  The filet accomanied by prociutto (I always spell that wrong) wrapped leeks (divine) just melted in your mouth - and the shortribs (want a little beef with your beef?) were good, too.

I opted to get an app as an entree - and had the unqiue -and uber-rich - lobster mac 'n cheese.  It was more like mezza-canelloni each topped/stuffed with small, buttery lobster medalions.  Served with it was a copious amount of rich, creamy cheese sauce - cheddar, gouda and something else.

WOW.  Don't miss the lobster mac!

To make up for the weird dinner service (AWKWARD!) they comped our desserts, cappucinos (delish - La Colombe)  and 2 of the 4 glasses of wine.

The pineapple cucumber sorbet was simply perfect.  Refreshing and ""sang"" on the palate.  Served over diced honeydew and plums.  The blackberry verjus sorbet was also good - but nothing compared to that Pineapple Cucumber.  It was capogiro worthy and obviously house made - served in perfect quenelles. (Can't wait to try the Kalamansi icecream and of course - who doesn't love a good gianduja?) Oh, my thighs!

My friend ordered the chocolate cream and apple pie (with a decadent sour cream quenelle beside it.

Also to make things ""special they gave us an amuse-bouche pre-dessert of cinnamon panna cotta with a lovely rose-water sugar crysal topping and two picture-perfect fresh raspberries.

After dinner they served us each a crisp (not rock-hard) house-made cinnamon biscotti and - the best yet - buttery blueberry financiers (OK I can't spell that either).

KUDOS to your pastry chef.  He or she is a keeper.

Oh and Zaga is really a master - wow.

Such fun to watch y'all work.  If you can fix a few kinks in your service and have a more welcoming hostess stand - the 5 stars will stick!

Good work!  We can't wait to try your place in University City.

Oh - and they have a small private party room that seats 12 or so - and I hear a big one that seats about 100.  This would be a great wedding or rehearsal dinner setting.

And I bet plenty of marriage proposals will go down here.

The Fat Ham is way more than just HAM! We ended up ordering 12 plates (which all had amazing tastes...every dish was VERY flavorful).

-HOT CHICKEN - it was fried perfectly and tossed with the special ""HOT"" sauce which was very HOT, but deeeeelicious and we could not stop eating it. We ended up getting 3 orders of the HOT CHICKEN!

About three seconds later we were able to sit down. My only complaint with Honey's is the seating arrangement. Maybe it's because I've seen approximately five other humans in the past week due to the hours I've been keeping, but I was easily irritated by the close proximity of the other diners.

My boyfriend got chicken & waffles which is hard to mess up. The chicken was extremely salty which we chucked up to balancing out the sweetness of the waffle with syrup.

Since my diet is limited to poultry and seafood I didn't have many options to pick from the menu. I chose the turkey burger which was underwhelming at best.

I got the 3 taco deal ($8 for 3, or else it's $3 each). I ordered 2 shortribs and 1 chicken. I'm glad I got two of the shortribs b/c they were by far better (maybe just personal taste). It was a sweet glazed BBQ flavor, yum! Only problem was that the beef was too tough, wayyy overcooked. The flavor made up for it. The chicken was a curry satay flavor, not so sure how I feel about it in a taco.

The soft taco shells were so-so, nothing special, but not bad, probably store bought. The semi spicy mayonnaise was pretty tasty though!

I also ordered mango ""tea"", which is a slight misnomer. It's more of a really sweet yogurt (condensed milk?) drink... So something like a mango lassi, no tea in it. For $2, it's not bad, but they reAlly should call it something else! Add 50cents to add boba to your drink.

So why 4 stars when I thought the food was mediocre? Friendly service goes a long way, and they just seemed like really nice people.

The dumplings, while not as original, were just as satisfying. While these two appetizers really impressed me, the BBQ pig tails were easily my favorite of the 3 apps that we ordered. The meat fell right off the bone and was incredibly juicy. While we didn't try the famous garlic wings this time, they are surely on the radar for our next trip.

The entrees were excellent as well. My girlfriend got the brisket and I got the bolognasian. We felt both were excellent and ultimately agreed that the bolognasian was the stronger of the two. We are both fans of heartier tasting sauces.

We were well-prepared for a long wait. I'm happy to pay my dues to wait for a delicious meal that gives me something I can't get elsewhere, but Honey's just did not deliver. 

Honey's didn't make a great impression right off the bat. We asked if we could order iced coffees for while we waited; we were shuttled between different areas of the counter and it was difficult to find out where they wanted us to be. It would have been easier for them to just tell us that they wouldn't serve us anything until we were seated. We ended up feeling awkward and in the way. 

Once we were seated, I was not particularly excited by the food options. The restaurant and menu seem to give off a Jewish/Israeli vibe, and it would have been great if there were more offerings that fit the theme - but other than offerings of latkes and challah as sides, I didn't see anything that would have looked out of place on any other brunch menu in the city. If anything, it seemed like the kitchen couldn't figure out if they were a Jewish deli, down-home Southern kitchen, or Mexican spot. 

I ended up getting the honey-fried chicken fingers. I was disappointed that I couldn't order the child's size portion, since I did not really want a huge platter of chicken. I was excited that the platter came with hush puppies, but they were disappointing - not very flavorful or moist. It is hard to mess up fried balls of corn dough. That is an accomplishment. The breading for the chicken did not stay on and was oily and not very flavorful. Honestly, the chicken fingers at Ihop beat the ones at Honey's. And they charged me for BBQ sauce. Seriously? You can't toss in a free sauce for a platter of chicken fingers?

I don't think Honey's will miss my business, as they had a huge crowd waiting for brunch through the early afternoon on a Saturday.

The restaurant is relatively small with communal seating, but most of the time you'll have plenty of space as it isn't regularly packed. The pizza here is by far the best in Philadelphia and Pizzeria Vetri is highly consistent in quality across their pizzas. (I've had five different pizzas? I think?) My favorite is the Salsiccia and I also love whatever they typically have for their pizza al taglio special. Every combination they come up with for their pizza al taglio sounds exceptionally delicious and the actual product is even better. The pizzas are always light without being soggy and are typically minimally dressed. This is important, because the quality of the ingredients and the care in the preparation of the pizza allows the flavors to really shine distinctly without the unnecessary clutter and calories people tend to go for. Each ingredient is picked for its bold flavor, meaning that only a small amount is necessary to get the full taste experience. Adding more of those things haphazardly does nothing to improve the taste one bit and instead weighs down the pizza and the entire experience itself. When leaving Pizzeria Vetri, I feel full but refreshed, not bloated and sick. 

This feeling is also aided by the FREE sparkling water that I always get which is delicious and unlimited. This is unlike some places I've been to that want to charge me outrageous prices for such a thing. They also have good root beer, a good selection of San Pellegrino drinks, etc. One drink that is very good that I often get is the Rosemary Lemonade. I don't see it often, and I think it should be more of a mainstream drink. Herbs are highly under utilized as flavoring agents... life is more than sugar and more sugar.

In addition to this all, the atmosphere is quite lovely. The space is airy, the small space keeps it from getting loud, and the music is set at a low level so that it is audible, but you can't necessarily make it out completely unless you focus in on it. This is IMPORTANT because other places in this city (pizza places I'm thinking of specifically) BLARE their music so loud that I cannot talk to the person in front me whatsoever without having to scream. Even then... Still, I often find myself tuning into the music because I absolutely love their choices. I'm a big fan of 80s/90s ""old-school/golden age"" hip-hop and they play a lot of my favorite cuts. In fact, I don't know if I've ever heard a bad song here. It is also a nice showcase for how hip-hop isn't necessarily vulgar and offensive like many people may think. 

So, everything here I consider perfect. I've tried a LOT of pizza places in this city, including the ""gourmet"" ones. I have not tried Nomad yet, and when I do I will update this review but, for now, Vetri is EASILY the best pizza in this city. Their salads look amazing as well, but I've yet to order one.

First, the restaurant is very small, and they don't take reservations for parties of less than six. So you will be waiting a while for a table. (In the summer they have additional outdoor seating, but in the fall/winter that doesn't work.) 

I had the Tasting Board which was a nice selection of (mostly fried) appetizers, but a bit pricey at $17. My partner had the Bacon and Brie Grilled Cheese, which sounds promising, but was horrible because they put uncooked bacon in the cheese sandwich BEFORE grilling, which resulted in a sandwich with nearly-raw bacon inside, and bacon grease all over the place. This dish might work if they cooked, or partially cooked, the bacon before putting it in the sandwich and grilling. This disaster was $13. 

Selection of craft beers and wines was very good. Service seemed very rushed, and missed obvious things like clearing the table, leaving dirty dishes on the table after dinner, through presenting the bill, and collecting payment. The dirty dishes were still there when we left. Can't remember the last time that happened to us in a restaurant. 

This place has some potential, particularly in the vegetarian menu, and a nice location. Now if they could just smooth the rough spots from the menu and train the servers a little, they'd have something.",2016-10-16 16:38:38,"{'food': ['Tasting Board', 'Bacon and Brie Grilled Cheese'], 'drink': ['Craft beers and wines']}"

Starting at check in, our room was not ready at the time they had told us, and we had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby for a room to open up. They said they upgraded our room when we finally were told we could go up, but that seemed to only be something they told us to appease us rather than actually be true. The room had nice views of the city, and I imagine that most rooms high up in this hotel will. The walls are paper thin though, so expect it to be noisy by you.

The lounge and bar is interesting. The lounge is small and very dirty. The chairs are all torn up and look like they have needed to be replaced for years now. Wifi is only free in the lobby and lounge so unless you want to spend $12.95 a day for wifi, you'll end up in the shitty lounge. The restaurant/lounge food and drink is extremely expensive, so if you're looking for food,  try dining at a local Philly establishment instead.

The robes in the rooms are so relaxing and nice to take to the spa or wear in your room. the building is nice, but the elevators will give you a headache after riding in them. They have two different elevator sets to take you to different levels which can confuse you for the first day. They also go ridiculously fast which for my group was painful and not a good thing.

We have been frequenting Prime Rib for the last few years, not on a consistent basis by any means, but every once in awhile. Usually at the bar on a Sunday evening. The food is always really good, not in an 'OH MY God' way, like James, but in a 'damn that's good' kind of way. The partner loves prime rib and I'll usually go for one of the cuts. They have great prix fix menu's and I think on Sunday nights they have 1/2 price bottles of wine. Good Happy Hour too, from what I read. 
But the two things that I really enjoy about Prime Rib, is first the staff. Friendly, attentive and really good looking.  A bar staff that is friendly at a steak house??? What?! Are you crazy?? Yep, , friendly. Try to get a pleasant bartender at Union Trust or Del Frisco's or Barclay Prime! Forget about it. Next attentive. They are there if needed but not all smoochy and up your ass. Nice. Next attractive. Seriously. A really good looking staff. Not Starr 'model' pretentious. But really nice looking, from the manager on down to the bus boys.

My group of four was looking for a bite to eat around 11pm on a Monday night. Luckily we made last call for food at Mac's Tavern before the kitchen closed for the night. 

So Mac's is nothing like Paddy's Pub in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It's a lot classier of a joint, although it is pretty cool that it's partly owned by the show's stars, Rob and Kaitlin McElhenney. Despite not being Paddy's Pub, it is a really chill pub to grab a drink.

Last night was my first foray into their menu. On Monday nights they have a special on fish tacos that is $2 off the menu price. The majority of my group jumped on the fish taco boat. The fish tacos were really awesome.  The platter came with four large pieces of tempura battered tilapia and the pieces to put together your own taco which included soft tortilla shells, guacamole, cheese, pico de gallo, peppers and a chipotle mayo sauce. This was the biggest portion of fish tacos I've seen in a while and tasty to boot. It was fun getting to put together the tacos myself. 

So my only gripe was the service. I understand it was a random weeknight in the summer and there was only one person working, aside from taking our order and dropping off our food/drink, my group was practically ignored. My one friend sat there with an empty water glass for the majority of the meal and didn't even get the opportunity to ask the server for more. Had the server/bartender stopped by more frequently, we probably would have ordered more beers in addition to more water. The kitchen may have closed shortly after we received our food, but the bar was certainly open still.

On the topic of beers, I thought the draft list was pretty cool. The beers were eclectic, but simple at the same time. The breweries they carried were off the beaten path, but with classic beer styles. I had the Citrus & Piney by the Hop Concept. I've never heard of this Cali brewery before, but enjoy a familiar tasting imperial/double IPA.

But these guys have truly got the goods: great food and great prices, a friendly attitude, and creativity! There are already plenty of spots to grab a greasy cheesesteak, so this place is a welcome (and delicious) change of pace.

I've ordered delivery several times, but went in yesterday for a sit-down meal. Between three people, we got an order of the Sweet & Sour Miso balls, an order of the Spicy Shrimp, and a classic takoyaki. We also settled on the curry fries (SO GOOD) and ended up splitting the dessert special of the day- Snickerdoodle balls, with a side of whipped cream and chocolate sauce! In total, it was about 22 bucks and totally filled us up. First, I have to remark on the presentation- a lot of care is put into those little takoyaki! The food is cute and nicely arranged, with sauce, scallions, and bonito carefully laid over top. Their texture (a little crisp on the outside, doughy on the inside) is delightful, especially when they're fresh and hot. The curry fries were topped with onions and smelled heavenly- they tasted even better. Their curry is definitely slow-simmered and has a rich, beefy flavor, lots of carrots and potatoes. Dessert was also terrific; the melting chocolate chips inside the Snickerdoodles, wow!

It's a small location but very clean, bright, and cheerful. You can find green tea, iced tea and lots of other drinks in the back cooler, plus a second small cooler full of fresh salads and other snacks. Their daily specials mix things up a bit, and everything is basically under ten bucks. I've tried their take-out lunches as well: for around eight bucks, you can grab a rice bowl with curry or chicken, beef, etc., plus a salad, miso soup, and a drink. Can't beat that- everyone at work was jealous of my gorgeous lunch when it showed up!

Yelp reviews were decent, so we decided to try it out. Food was A-OK, my friend and I had burgers and my friend's husband had a club sandwich of some sort. No complaints really, just tasted like your typical run of the mill pub food. 

Now, the only reason I gave 1 star is because of the atmosphere. After dinner, we decided to grab a seat at the bar for some drinks. OH did I mention that it took over half an hour to get our check from dinner, because they were having trouble running credit cards (they claimed their wifi was down but were able to only run 1 card and not the others??) so they then asked us to use the ATM and pay in cash! It was almost like I was being punished with ATM fees because THEIR systems weren't working. Cool. Anyway, AFTER this whole debacle, we sat at the bar and ordered a couple beers, which the bartender/owner gave us for free because of the ordeal we just went through. We were totally cool up until this point, when we started playing music on the jukebox, and a group of older-aged patrons at the other end of the bar were making fun of us. To our complete shock, the bartender/owner was CHIMING IN and laughing right along with them!!! What kind of bar OWNER does that, to brand new patrons?? Not smart. We were so offended, that we promptly took back the tips we were leaving for him, and left the bar.

We arrived 15 minutes late for our reservation but fortunately it wasn't a problem.  The service was good and the waiter reminded me of Alton Brown somewhat in appearance and demeanor (not a bad thing).  And I actually like that he didn't refill our wine glasses after the initial filling.  I know some of you like waiters to do that but I think waiters at BYOs don't have any idea about how the wine is being distributed at the table and sometimes people drink faster and really shouldn't have their glasses automatically refilled because then they're getting a disproportionate share of the bottle.  Here I go off on a tangent again.  I am a wine Marxist.

We ordered appetizers of a certain kind of Amazonian fish (I guess the Greeks can cook fish from anywhere) and the trio of dips.  The dips were excellent, especially the garlic one.  A sizeable morsel of said dip remained on the plate and then a waiter whisked it away before I could tell him that me doth protest.  Those waiters are awfully quick to take your plates and ask you if they can take it *while taking it away*.  Hold on to your horses, boys.  I also almost lost my last bite of my entree this way but I was quicker on the draw that time.

It wasn't till nearly the end of our dip feast that the waiter informed us that the fish appetizer had been sold out.  So that's fine, but why it took him that long to realize I'm not sure.  We ordered the octopus ragout in its place, which arrived promptly and was very pleasing.  The octopus was tender (for octopus) and all the flavors came together harmoniously.  I loved the little bits of chorizo-like sausage in it, whatever they were.

I had the goat entree, which was steaming hot upon its arrival but fortunately cooled off quickly.  The portion size was decent and the meat was amply tender.  Combined with barley, greek yogurt, breaded eggplant, etc. it was a nice homey dish.  I sampled my sister's quail, constituting my first bite ever of this fowl.  Lacking other quail experience I can't comment too much on it but the meat seemed to be cooked well.  The sauce for this dish was pretty heavy on the sherry.  My sister seemed to like this aspect; I would have been more on the fence about it.  Every course of the evening was seasoned well. ++

I don't know if I'd rush back here but would recommend it without much hesitation to anyone looking for Greek.  I'd like to give it four and a half stars.  WHY can't Yelp have a half star option?

This place is a real treat - I used to live in Providence years ago, which had a few great spots for Cambodian, but I haven't found anything that came close until now.

First, everything is super-fresh and done just right. Crispy crunchy papaya salad, perfectly grilled and delicately-seasoned beef with lime juice, etc, etc. Perfect for a summer dinner (and presumably other seasons as well), and they even brought out some yummy samples of jackfruit and dragonfruit as a post-dinner palate cleanser.

Second, they understand that 'hot' means 'hot', and they didn't simply assume that I have a glass jaw when it comes to spicy food just because my skin is so pale that it borders on see-through. I don't, and their 'hot' was enough to make blood come rushing up to my cheeks but not so bad that I wanted to pause in my consumption for even a second. Proper.

And finally, they're super-nice and friendly - the waiter checked back to make sure the extra peppers in my food weren't slowly dissolving me from the inside out, and everybody checked in with me at some point to see how the meal was. There was a little bit of a wait, but totally worth it.

Tacos were pretty pathetic, though.

I'm sure the flour tortillas were a specific choice, but corn is better.  I'm willing to concede that that might be a personal choice, though, so why not offer it...  

Tortillas, fish, cabbage, cilantro and lime.  That's the essential base.   Anything extra is the embellishment that makes whatever taco you are eating unique.  In this case there is no lime or cilantro, so what overpowers center stage is the orange sauce. Skip it! It's too much like what's on the fish tacos at Distrito, and those are goofy little fish-sticky things. 

And...

The reason fish tacos generally come with two tortillas is because there is so much stuff in the taco that the extra tortilla is there for structural support...or as means for assembling a second taco out of all the good stuff you have left on your plate after eating the first taco.  It's all about abundance, and regrettably, these are bland, feeble little things.   I can't believe Jose Garces had anything to do with them.

Sparks:

The hostess and server were very welcoming, warm, and didn't seem rushed by our late appearance.

The hostess used my name in her greeting (almost as cool as when they do it at the Ritz). 

The server asked if we'd ever dined with them before and then proceeded to explain how the restaurant menu was structured, how the selections were seasonal, and then recommended his favorite selections. While this didn't quite meet the expectations I spoke of on my site, he came the closest out of all the restaurants I've dined at previously.

The bartender, Sasha, is seriously one of the restaurant's best assets. She has a magnetic personality and came over to check to see if our drinks were satisfactory.

 There were servers who came around to ensure our water glasses were filled, as well as those who brought around their signature popovers (yum!).

The server kept our table clean and folded our napkins when one of us left the table.

As expected, everyone we came across was clean, professional, and personable.
I received 1,000 dining points on Open Table (likely due to the time of the reservation)!

Kelley B. has been to Sketch Burger with me on occasion and understands my burger list and standards. I at long last had the opportunity to try Bareburger with my daughter last Friday night as my wife was at her niece's party. 

Bareburger was pretty crowded on this Friday so we opted for seats at the bar in the back to avoid waiting for a table. I ordered the Country Fare Bison burger. This was a great tasting burger with aged cheddar, dill pickles, red onions, green leaf, and mayo and brioche bun. The meat was moist, flavorful and juicy, so juicy it was a little messy but I was prepared with extra napkins in hand. The bun bottom got a little soggy, that was my only negative. I am not sure how their burger would hold up for take out. We also had an order fries and the dipping sauces were fantastic, especially the curry ginger catsup. To be somewhat on the healthy side, we shared the Berry Blue salad, which had some excellent flavors and a nice apple cider vinaigrette dressing.

Bareburger had about 6 smaller or craft beers on tap. The space is industrial chic and comfortable. Service was friendly but spotty on the night we visited. That was fine as we were not in a big rush and enjoyed the people watching. They gave us free dessert because they were a bit crazy, always a nice plus.

I was surprised by the number of people in there, it usually seems dead to me. The service was really helpful, our waiter knew everything about the dishes I asked about. Started with the nachos which I typically use as an indicator on how good a place is. They were decent, nothing to write home about with a sweet tasting cheese sauce and somewhat brown guacamole which was very flavorless, could have used some spicing up. The Carolina Gumbo which consists of a tomato broth with carrots, onions beef and lamb was tasty but again needed some added spice, it was a little flavorless.

My friends ordered the burger (with boursin and bacon) and the BBQ pork (with a side of collard greens and mac n' cheese). Both enjoyed their dishes, the burger was perfectly cooked and the BBQ sauce on the pork was surprisingly sweet and tangy. I went with the duck quesadilla which I enjoyed. Quesadillas in general are usually a pretty disappointing order and I couldn't decide at the last minute but these things were bursting with flavor.

Again, it was overall a decent meal, probably my first and last time eating there but I'll definitely be back to the bar more often. Check out their happy hour from 4-7 which features $3 beers, wine and cocktails and also $3 appetizers.

To make up for lost time, I called Xochitl to see if I can get a table for early Friday evening knowing that it's near impossible and after being told that they don't have any openings until after 10pm over really bad receptions, I found an opening on OpenTable at the time that I wanted. I wonder how these things work.

It was right after the snow storm and the streets are all piled up with snow banks and ice. My boyfriend and I arrived earlier than expected and got seated not long after at a table. I was surprised to see that despite the unusually bad condition outside, the restaurant is still quite packed. 

The restaurant week menu is filled with items that usually appear on their regular prix fixe. We got an order of guacamole for the table. The server brought up a platter of ingredients, preparing the guacamole right in front of us (or in this case behind me.) Unfortunately, the aisle is kind of narrow and stepladder was riding on the coat I put on my chair. The ingredients include avocado, lime juice, cilantro, finely diced onion, jalapeno, habaneros and some kinds of cheese. The end product is to die for.

For appetizers, the boyfriend got a cazuela de chorizo y papas and I got an order of chicharrones. The chorizo and potatoes casserole taste like a spiced up well made corn beef hash which is pleasant and comforting. While I love chicharrones, the plate is a bit awkward; I had no idea what is the proper way to eat this dish. While its theoretically correct to pair fat with acid, the acidity in the salsa verde seems to be too imposing and one-dimensional. And if I'm forced to use my hand for the oversized chicharrones, how am I supposed to keep my hand dry getting the radishes inside the sauce?

For entrees, I had the scrumptious costilla de res. I have been having a lot of mole lately and I wasn't particularly excited for another mole dish but I did want something meat-and-potato-y and I was very glad to get this dish. The short-rib was tender and juicy, the mole was the best I've had yet, the potato puree was like silk, combining with the spinach makes it the perfect dish. The arroz con pollo was nice enough, using beer to make it adds a peculiar bitterness and instead of being crispy, the chicken is a bit crunchy which is interesting even though it's on a drier side.

I go crazy for churros and the ones at Xochitl doesn't disappoint. Geniusly paired with a taza of Mexican hot chocolate for dipping, it adds an amazing array of flavors to an already delicious fried dessert. The pay de coco is cute but forgettable. I've had better but it's a nice choice. 

It's a nice place and the service is friendly. The vintage South American movie posters serve as interesting conversation starters but a few trendy Mexican restaurants uses them as decoration and no matter who started using them, it's getting a bit tiring. I like the fact that they serve Jarritos for I love them. 

At the end of the night, we spent $100 for a few small plates and I caught an error on the bill where they charged us beers that we didn't consume and they were polite and nice about taking it off, but one still has to wonder if the meal we had was worth the money we paid.",2011-01-30 01:23:05,"{'food': ['guacamole', 'chorizo and potatoes casserole', 'chicharrones', 'costilla de res', 'arroz con pollo', 'churros'], 'drink': ['beer', 'hot chocolate']}"

I am writing this review because it is one of the most consistently enjoyable places in the area to sit and have a beer and to have some quality food at a good price.  

Black Sheep always has a good beer selection and includes seasonal specialties.  Still, you can get yourself a cheap domestic...which seems to be increasingly rare.  The food is always good...they have a great hamburger (get it medium-rare) and chicken sandwich and the fries that go along with them are tasty as well.  

The staff at Black Sheep is always nice and they do a good job of trying to accomodate you and your party if there isn't much seating.  I would say that if this place did have any drawbacks, it would be (1) that the layout doesn't allow it to be a good stand-up-and-drink bar if all the seats are full and (2) that the TV's aren't great for a big sporting event...there just aren't enough of them.

All in all, a great center city pub.  I would have to say that the best time to enjoy the Black Sheep would be on weeknights or early on a Friday or Saturday when you are most likely to be able to find a seat and stay put for a while.",2010-12-01 19:21:55,"{'food': ['hamburger', 'chicken sandwich', 'fries'], 'drink': ['beer']}"

In fact, I like Marathon as a general rule. But this location... I want to like it. I work less than a block from here. My only frame of reference with this restaurant comes from the first time I tried to order take out and I was placed on hold. For about 7 minutes. Why I stayed on hold so long? I was desperate for a salad. 

I called back two weeks later for this same salad: spring greens, artichoke hearts, goat & cheddar cheese, and white balsamic. I successfully ordered this salad. When I picked it up, service was decent. It was ready when they said it would. Then I got back to work, ready to EAT! I opened the bag and found a soggy, wet, nasty soup that barely lined the bottom of the plastic container it came in. The veggies were completely swimming in white balsamic. I ate three bites and wanted to vomit. Perhaps I should have ordered the dressing on the side, but I thought that was common practice with to-go salads. The size of the salad was unacceptable - I've had their salads before and this was maybe half the size. Perhaps I should have complained at the time and taken it back, but I was so sickened and disappointed I didn't.

All of that being said, I'm giving this place two stars because it's not all that bad. Just that one time, it was really, really bad. Marathon on the Square is better. But Marathon in University City is worse (FYI).",2009-10-27 17:25:09,"{'food': ['salad'], 'drink': []}"

the burger was good -- great even! -- perfectly cooked (medium rare, like they recommend), and high-quality beef. Yum!  But the bun was weird (too big, and strange-tasting) and the fries were disgusting. Let me explain;

500 degrees offers 3 varieties of fries: regular, ""spicy"" and ""truffle."" I went with 2 friends and we each tried a different variety. To start, the food all came in one giant bag, with nothing labeled...so it took a good while to sort out what was what. The regular fries were sorta your average fast-food fries. Ok, but nothing special. My ""spicy"" fries were exactly the same except covered in Old Bay. Still, there was something off about the taste, I couldn't put my finger on. They tasted...moldy, almost, and like they had sopped up 2000 pounds of grease. Yuck. Which brings me to the truffle fries, which were so disgusting that one bite completely killed my appetite and left me feeling nauseous for the rest of the day. What do they put in these? I have no idea, but it is GROSS.

The service here left much to be desired as well. The guy behind the counter was rude, and when I asked him for a refill on my Diet Coke (which was -- no joke -- 80% ice, with about 2 sips of soda), he told me ""No can do."" Umm, ok.

When we finally did pay, we all chipped in cash and therefore overpaid by about $20 expecting to get the change back (because keep in mind, the undeserved large gratuity was already included).

No matter, perhaps I shall head over there again to ask the staff... because I will  just take any excuse to go and indulge in their delicious selection of creative rolls that explode crunchy, spicy, creamy avocado-y, savory, sweet, tangy flavors in your mouth.   

Personally, I am a fan of spicy crunchy things so some of my faves include the sixers roll, the mcnabb (def the roll, ambivalent about the football player), the viking (VICTORY~!) roll, and the yellow stallion. 

I like the Spider roll here, but it's not one of my faves. Definitely a solid offering - upside, you get 6 pieces which is more than most sushi places, but downside is it's smaller. IMO, when the softshell crab is that small, you start to lose the flavor of the crab and get more of the soy-based sauce and/or avocado. 

Lovely things: BYOB, attentive and friendly staff, speedy food delivery, takes rezzies, relatively inexpensive for sushi and they don't rush you out. 

Sushi aside, I really enjoyed the agedashi tofu - Makiman's version of this dish comes with a LOT of bonita flakes. However, the dolsot bibimbap was just okay. There was so much sesame oil mixed in that towards the bottom 1/4 of the bowl, there was a pool of spicy oil drowning the remaining veggies and rice.",2011-03-29 18:32:13,"{'food': ['mah-kee-mah-n', 'mah-kee-man', 'sixers roll', 'mcnabb', 'viking roll', 'yellow stallion', 'Spider roll'], 'drink': []}"

The first thing I noticed was how small it was. However, this wasn't a problem since I was the only one there. The self service soda fountain is nice. The place was clean and attractive. 

I ordered the 500 burger and regular fries. My better half got the truffle fries. Those two fries are exactly the same except for some spray bottle crap that they barely put on the truffle fries. $1 more for a spray bottle and they didn't taste any different. Other than that, the plain shoestring fries are quite good, nice and crispy. I just don't see what this truffle fries thing is all about.

The burger was super hot and well cooked, but it was served with a cold bun and equally cold toppings. They didn't warm up as you ate it either. The flavor in the meet was acceptable but I've had better. The bread was terrible, super thick and overpowering. 

The shakes were pretty darn good, though. I would stop in for one of those again.

Since the place is small, the kitchen is right there at the seating area. There is no divider other than the soda fountain. The crew that was working there was very loud and annoying.

We came here after eating at Supper with family and friends and a total of 9. This place was a lot smaller than I expected. We were able to secure the tables out front of the restaurant, even with the chilly weather it was ok because they had heat lamps underneath the awning, nice touch. They only serve beer and wine here, and what a great beer and wine list it was! They listed the beers in 4 categories:  Invigorating (Victory Prima Pils), Friendly (Yards ESA), Profound (TRAPPISTES ROCHEFORT 8), Extreme (Dogfish Head Immort Ale). I started in the Profound category and went with the Stone Vertical Epic 11.11.11. This is a fantastically flavorful beer made with chilies and cinnamon, probably one of my favorites.  I don't see this beer around very often.

My buddy and I hung out at the counter for a while and just sort of took in the location. It was a very diverse bar but was still very relaxing to be at. Looking behind the counter I noticed a large cheese cloth was covering something. Oh man, it was covering cheese. I didn't even see the cheese menu! Wow, what a great cheese listing. Again, they had some monster selections from all over the world. It was hard to control myself but restrained from purchasing any cheese. 
The wine menu looked stellar as well, great selections from all over the world. Disappointing however, this is another wine bar location that does not offer Virginia wines. I am telling you try a Virginia wine, they are good.

My buddy ordered the grilled asparagus salad and it looked awesome. I don't know how he ate it after the four course dinner we just had, but obviously it was good because he crushed it and licked the plate. 

My next beer selection was....the Saison Dupont. This is farmhouse ale that was crisp and had a good hoppy kick to it. Never had it before, but I will say this, I would get it again.

Overall pretty cool place, the only downside is that it gets packed in there because it is very small.  Next time I definitely plan on jamming on some cheese and enjoying some rarely seen beers!

Noticing it was 5 of 7 and the place was clearing out, I went on to Open Table and showed him how I could and would be happy to make a reservation for 7pm if I had to (ridiculous as that might be). He seemed surprised and said he would check again. He went over and spoke to the hostess and came back and said well we have several reservations at 7 and yes you could make one but we would probably sit you at a small table anyway. Sorry there is nothing I can do. And he simply walked away. So we really had no choice but to leave. It was a little after 7 and there were plenty of empty tables.

I love the powdered cinnamon and the small amount of vanilla cream on top. Mine could've used a little more custard filling, but what custard I got was a perfect complement to the layers.

xTNzRgNqSFv89QbccuKCaA,oWcJd69d3lmBO0ysQvq7Qw,u7_3L1NBWgxhBM_B-cmmnA,3,5,4,4,"I think everyone is running on the fumes of serious hype and marketing on this place.  I don't hate it, I'm not in love with it.  When I get the bill I definitely loose any love that may have been in my heart for the place.  It was close to $100 after tip for two pizzas, and two drinks each, for lunch.  We didn't walk out stuffed, or drunk, either.  I'm not basing this review on price at all.  Obviously, this place is very busy, and others are satisfied with the price point.

I love the location, the concept, the seating, and most of the feel.  As usual, I reviewed the menu before going down, and I was excited.  I was so happy to see the Tonno on the menu.  I'm Italian.  Growing up,  tuna was in our pasta, pizza, and pretty much anything with a tomato sauce,  especially at this time year.  My friends, and in laws, have always been disgusted by this.  Thanks to Mr. Vetri for incorporating this aspect into his pizza.  I really feel he opened up a lot of peoples' eyes.  I actually made a pizza with tuna a few months ago for a holiday gathering. I was blasted for committing such a terrible offense.  I mentioned it was a traditional family recipe.  At that point insults started being thrown at my family.  I then told everyone about the Tonno at PV, and all of a sudden I was rockstar.  They loved my pizza.  They would have asked me to remove it from the residence immediately otherwise, let alone anyone actually tasting it.  PV starts at 3 stars before I even set foot in the place, based on the redemption of tuna on pizza alone.

The reason PV does not accel beyond those three stars is in the details.  If you're shooting for an exceptional wood fired pizza these days, everything has to be beyond perfect.  The crust is decent, it could have used more crispiness.  It had the nice, flavor filled dots of char; but had no crisp at all.  This was a real shame, because a slight crisp would have highlighted how light and airy it is.  I really do think the sauce is excellent.  It's still a sauce, but it has a fresh crushed tomato sweetness and a natural acidic byte.  This is the secret to amazing pizza, along with the crust.  The mozzarella was decent, kind of average.  Overall, it has everything going for it to be a solid wood fired pizza, but falls flat on assembly.  Notice I stated SOLID, not blowing my doors off in satisfying  the three key factors. 

This is where the first offense occurs.  Am I really supposed to be satisfied with two, sometimes three, inches of untopped crust on the edges? Granted the crust is good, but you're really cutting our pizza in half.  Filling that outside rim with sauce and cheese doubles the area of actual pizza.  Are they skimping on sauce and cheese?  Does PV think it's appealing to a have 6"" diameter area of actual pizza in the center of that field of crust?

The second offense was a detail thing as well.  I loved that the red pepper flakes and grated cheese were front and center.  These are an absolute must for a great tasting pizza, and need to be applied by the eater in their preferred ratio.  The red pepper flakes were excellent, as was the quality of the grated cheese.  The problem was that it was impossible to get the cheese out of the shaker.  Grated cheese shakers need to be rotated through the refrigerator constantly to keep the cheese dry enough to actually be usable. You can do the old school, Italian thing and unscrew the top before even checking if it's dry enough to be shaken, but it's still going to come out in huge balls.  It shouldn't be this difficult.

I love the selection of beer, and a huge plus for a good selection of cans.  There's just something satisfying about a great beer that you can get get in a can, especially with pizza.  I had a bottled, aged Brooklyn cocktail, and it was excellent.  It definitely should have been for the price.  Okay, I'm sorry. I'm going to back to cost again. It's pizza, served in kind of a traditional style pizza place.  If a hoagiemouth pal offered to buy me lunch, and I took him here.  He'd probably see the bill, knock my lights out on the walk home, and stop at Wawa for a shorti to stop his stomach from growling.   The bathroom arrangement is also kind of bizarre.  I grew up entering the Italian restaurant through the back door, saying hello to everyone in the kitchen.  They've reversed this concept, where you get to meet everyone in the kitchen doing the walk of shame to the single sh--ter.  Skimping on the lavatory seems to be a common theme for most new restaurants in the city.  So I'm really not going to hold this against PV.

Three stars for effort, but I'm probably not coming back.  Most things are done right here, and done very well.  Although, it claims to be a pizzeria.  Which means the pizza had better be the performer.  I'll make the drive to get a better wood fired pizza, for almost half the price, at DiMeo's in Andorra.",2014-03-09 06:59:18,"{'food': ['pizza', 'red pepper flakes', 'grated cheese'], 'drink': ['beer']}"

We did the 9 Course Tasting Menu, for $110 (they describe the courses before you order and can accommodate allergies, etc.) It includes dishes that are on and off the menu. We also did the wine pairing for $65, which my one friend and I split since we couldn't imagine doing this for NINE courses (we'd be on the floor!)

Another yelper mentions that the menu is not very vegetarian friendly, and I agree with that. There are only 1-2 vegetarian option for each course and with it being a pre fixe menu, you HAVE to choose something for each course.

Also, there is a garage right next to the restaurant costs only $10 on the weekends. (Super convenient!)

We arrived 20 minutes late and called ahead to let them know. (Note: Holidays = Traffic.) Our party of three arrived and we were seated promptly.

Tip for the hostesses: When you ask if we are celebrating anything and we say no, leave it at that! We were trying to surprise out friend and that was blown by the hostess insisting someone told her it was a bday.

From the reviews we read we interpreted service to be pretty much hit or miss and it took us about 20 minutes to get our menus and water so we prepared for poor service. However, our server was incredibly helpful and all of the runners and other servers were also very helpful and knowledgeable about the food and wine. 

I'm going to try my best to recall each dish but I may be a little off in some instances and these are definitely not the official names of these dishes..

First: Lobster Celery Mousse: This dish was DELICIOUS. It was a very unique dish, with bits of lobster on top of the ""celery mousse""

Second: Crudo with thinly sliced jalapenos and ranch popcorn: Unfortunately I don't recall the type of fish, but this was my FAVORITE dish of the night. Just the right amount of sea salt and jalapeno (I don't eat spicy but it was perfect). The wine paired with this was spot on, too.

Third: Foie Gras Soup: This is on the menu and were my two friends' favorite dish of the night. It was creamy and at just the right temperature.

Fourth: Black Cod: We expected this dish to be very Asian but it actually wasn't! This, too was delicious. The Bok Choy was flattened and went through some process and had an interesting taste to it. The cod was cooked to perfection.

Fifth: Beef with Soy-type Glaze and Asian Vegetable: Sorry, I really don't recall what accompanied the Beef, but it was delicious! This dish was Asian inspired and very tasty.

Sixth: Meatloaf with Potato Puree and Bacon Marmalade: This dish was a tad spicy and I think it had cranberry marmalade rather than bacon or with the bacon and no being a cranberry fan, I took this off. The meatloaf was very flavorful and a nice texture. The potato puree offset the meatloaf nicely with the creamy texture and flavor.

Seventh: Cheese Plate: This was a little disappointing because I was expecting bites of a variety of cheese, but there was just a 1.5"" square of cheese with a slice of bread and some veggies. The cheese was good, but very difficult to eat since it was harder so when I tried to cut it, it just kept sliding and sending pieces everywhere.
Salad: My friend hates cheese so they were kind enough to substitute it with another dish; in this case, salad. It was a bit bitter though since there was too much dill.

Eighth: Coconut Sorbet with Toasted Coconut Shavings: This was DELICIOUS! The coconut flavor was very understated and brought out by the toasted coconut shavings. Great palette cleanser. Even our friend who is not a coconut fan loved this!

Ninth: Pumpkin/Ginger Mouse over Gingersnap crumbles: I hate ginger; the pumpkin part was a bit less ginger-y so to me it was just OK but the consistency and texture were perfect. The pumpkin seeds were delicious, they were like peanut brittle but with sugar.

The entire meal was absolutely amazing! The food was so delicious, I forgot to drink my wine for most of the courses.

Our server was very accommodating and took the time to explain each dish and wine to us and answer our questions when we had any.

This would have been a FLAWLESS experience except that on the way out, I apologized for taking so long and the manager had the audacity to say ""OK, NOW you apologize on the way out.."" The was completely uncalled for and downright RUDE! Having waistressed, I know you want to turn tables, but really? 

We were only the second party do the 9 course tasting menu so they do have some kinks to work out, so don't blame us for taking long to enjoy our 9 course meal.

So this would have been a 5 or 6 star experience but I had to dock 0.5 stars for that.

Hopefully we will make it back soon, Sbraga seriously induces drool.",2011-12-06 16:50:40,

The first two times, even on a Sunday afternoon around 2:00 PM, there was over a 90 minute wait for a table. Ah, the power of yelp and the word getting out! Finally on this occasion, around 5:30 on a Sunday we walked in and at long last an open table. The place filled up pretty quickly and there was soon a waiting list. The list swelled to 14 by the time we left!

I would really want to give the Khmer Kitchen 3.5 stars but again I wish yelp had the 1/2 star feature. Why only 3 or 3.5 stars? This is kind of complicated. First, the staff at the Khmer Kitchen is polite and genuine. They explained that Khmer Kitchen is a true family run restaurant which is nice. However  organization is lacking.  For example, when we were seated it was about 10 minutes before we got a menu, and this was only after we asked for the menus from the table next to us to us when they were done ordering. Then we were informed all of the grilled meatballs and sticks were sold out. This was at 5:30 PM on a Saturday. Finally, they have a 2 cap table that they will not use to seat anyone. On two occasions, they told us, and several other patrons that the table is dangerous and can't be used. Why not get a new table, fix it or remove it? The place is small and only holds about 15-20 people, they could use  that extra table. It is just frustrating.

Once we ordered, and we ordered 4 dishes, the first three dishes came out very smoothly, actually perfectly, one almost precisely after we finished the last. The first dish was a beef stew that was on the special menu. It was excellent and tender. The waiter said it was slow cooked all day. It came with carrots and was very filling. The next dish we had was chicken in a pumpkin and ginger broth. This was also very good, Then we had the vegetable stir fry in curry which had a lot of flavor. We ordered one other dish, a grilled steak with cucumber and a spicy sauce. This was really good too and had a nice grilled flavor. The problem with this dish was we waited more then 30 minutes for the steak after our third dish was finished. We didn't have anywhere to go so it was fine. But we did feel bad for the several other patrons waiting patiently for their tables.

The food was very good and the prices were great. For 4 people our check was $46.00 and we over ordered by at least one dish. A party of four could easily eat happily here for under $10.00 each! The Khmer Kitchen is cash only too.

We would go back to the Khmer Kitchen but I would try to get even earlier when they are not so swamped so we could try the meatballs and grilled sticks. If they had all the menu items and the organization improved I would give Khmer Kitchen 4 stars easily.

There's very little veg options in Michigan.  But my visits have become less frequent, now only going when other veg friends are in town who love the idea of veg cheesesteak (and too poor for Horizons).

The pizza - it's really not very good at all.  I've gotten the vegan cheese pizza slices a few times, and every single time, the crust is dry like it's been sitting there for hours.  The toppings, when I've gotten them, aren't chopped into bite sized pieces, so don't really fit on top of a pizza well, and appear to be just thrown on after (they aren't stuck to the cheese).  The cheese is very sparse.  I see more sauce than cheese.  At first, I just figured it was a matter of more expensive ingredient - but they're charging more.  And I've just gotten irritated at this lack of concern for good food.

I do like the desserts.  And the steaks are ok.  My husband, an omnivore, says their meaty ones are ok - nothing special, not bad - but they're fairly large.

I find the staff, while never quite rude, definitely not friendly and don't seem to give a damn that someone is a paying customer.  It's definitely not a matter of ""getting what you give,"" as I'm never rude, sometimes overly considerate and apologetic if I'm taking more than a few seconds.

Pizza is the specialty here so we tried a couple of pies. I ordered the white clam, which didn't measure up to Pepe's in New Haven CT, but was still tasty. The pepperoni pie with red sauce had great flavor, and was my favorite of the two. The pizza would be perfect if the crust was a little crunchier but it errs toward floppy.

Luckily it was just 2 of us so we got a seat right away, the place was completely full at that point. First person to greet us is the chef, which is a nice surprise, but as time goes on we realize it's just because his waitress staff is very busy.

Menu looks great, we order Salt and Pepper Shrimp Rolls, the King and I and Jatujak Stir Fried Shrimp.

Salt and Pepper Spring Rolls came out fast. They were honestly just ok, they had mushroom in them, which wasn't listed as an ingredient, but the taste was very sub-par. Didn't really fit the flavor profile of salt and pepper shrimp with cilantro. The citrus lime dipping sauce was just thinned out duck sauce.

By the time we finished that we had both drank our glass of water and for the next 45 minutes we were ignored, no refill of water, no food, not even a look. Again I know they were busy, but when they would sit a table near us, they would bring them water and not even glance at our table.

Ok, 45 minutes after the appetizer, dinner comes. I'm eating the King and I which is basically Pad Prik King, string beans are undercooked which is actually how I like them in my Pad Prik King, very crunchy. But they taste dirty and the sauce doesn't seem like it was cooked with the food, just poured over at the very end. I like the flavors somewhat marinated with the protein and vegetables.

Girlfriend is eating the Jatujak, which said it was spicy, but wow it really is hot. Hotter then the 10 at Han Dynasty in Old City. I have a pretty high tolerance for spice so we switch plates. I get to a shrimp in the Jatujak that is right on the line of undercooked. I figured with the temperature hotness of the food it is probably fine, dumb mistake. The next day I was writhing in stomach pain.

Like I said before, they were busy, the chef even had to come out to help a little (which is an admirable trait for someone in the kitchen), but ignoring a table for 45 minutes when all they wanted was some more water (yes we did ask) and then serving undercooked seafood due to the pressure of getting the food out is inexcusable.

I ordered takeout through Zuppler, and there wasn't any way to add beverages or sides, so I thought I could just pick them up when I arrived. Alas, no. They enforced a $15 minimum, which is prohibited or seriously discouraged by all credit card companies, so no soda or rice.

A simple bit of courtesy would have been preferable to total indifference.

Now on to the food. My tuna was brown and my brown rice was dry. The cut of the sushi was not done terribly well. It didn't taste bad but it wasn't great. Good is probably even pushing it.

Strict $15 credit card minimum.

One of the first times I stopped at this location, I got a melt when I didn't ask for one, so I've resorted to specially asking for ""not the melt"" when I order. Again today I got a melt. This melt was also burnt to the point where I took a bite and the bread snapped in half all the way down the sandwich.

The bigger issue I have is they constantly put the spicy mustard on the sandwich and not the vinaigrette (it's supposed to come with the vinaigrette) Considering how great Cosi's vinaigrette is, this completely changes the sandwich. When switched the mustard is so strong it's overpowering. I've probably had this happen 4 or 5 times. It's gotten to the point where I get excited when my order is actually correct. I wonder if they look really similar or what the issue is?

The food was fantastic and a bargain given the quality and huge portions.

Even the appetizer platter (which, in most restaurants, is bland and a bit dull) was great. Even little things, like the green olive marinade and the iced mint tea, were perfect.

Also, as a native New Yorker, I was honestly shocked by the genuinely warm, incredibly helpful, and generally perfect service. The chef came to check on us (and even happily grabbed and disposed of a coffee cup I had when I came in), the hostess happily squeezed us in despite our reservation being an hour later on a busy Thursday night, and the waiters were knowledgeable and helpful without spending too much time explaining the food (which can be very frustrating in Mediterranean restaurants; we all know what labneh and hummus are, thank you).

esWwqJD0l-hAmSroVIoAvQ,c_lSEAQY9W3hgOrd1TYZCQ,DXYhpEv17mWqSqFjau7vhg,1,4,2,1,"Where to begin.. On Valentines day, I was called multiple times, requesting to switch my reservation. Fine, no big deal, the adjustment actually worked in my favor considering I had to commute to and from work prior.

We get to the restaurant 10 minutes before our reservation and the room is empty (why did I have to change my reservation?) and filled with putrid smoke: as if someone burned an entire steak to a crisp. I wave this off like nothing happened as I am excited to look at the menu; we are seated against the wall with very little room on either side. No doubt that the room is small, and I could understand needing the volume considering the rave reviews my friends have given the joint.

A waiter promptly attends us and asks us what our courses would be. This is the moment we learn that there is Prix fixe tonight - no notice in the phone call requesting a reservation change, no notice on their website or on their Facebook page. Hmm. I consider our options (being a party of 2) and immediately assume yes, this shouldn't be too much.

An aside here: I don't ever bother to eat Prix fixe unless I know exactly how much a meal costs prior. This was the first time I've ever thrown caution to the wind, and I can't regret it enough. 

We order our salads, apps, and meals. The ceasar salad is smaller than average but better than Burger King's, I suppose. This is promptly gobbled up and the next course arrives.. My partner ordered meatballs and I the roasted peppers. Her plate contains 2 large meatballs, covered in red sauce, standard fare. I tried them, they were pretty good, I cannot rescind that. My plate, however, consists of 10 square-inch pieces of cheese surrounding literally 5 strings of roasted red peppers. The cheeses were good, one of them was great, but the peppers absolutely came out of a jar from the supermarket across the street. Look up the definition of lackluster, those peppers are an example on Merriam-Webster.

We work our way through wine and eat what we have, and in a few minutes after all is clear, the entrees arrive. My chicken parmesan is par for the course- breaded chicken with tomato sauce, parmesan and spaghetti on the side. My partners lobster ravioli was ornately decorated and frankly, quite delicious. This is the last positive thing I will leave here.

We continued with our courses and were asked of our dessert choices. I opted for the mousse, she requested the marscapone.  The mood at the table was light for the last time. The instant our dessert arrived, the check followed. I chuckle over something lighthearted and bouncy, as valentines day should be, and opened the bill. Gasp. $150 for this meal (consisting on my end of less than 600 kcal, at most) for two people. 

For background, I've spent the last two valentines days at Italian restaurants. Last year, at Brigantessa of South Philly, we spent a total of $90 on a pizza, two meals and entrees, and some wine by the glass. The year prior at Bellini's, we each received stunning meals with appetizers and drinks for roughly $85. The food at both of these locations was considerably higher quality than what we received tonight. What we received should have been exactly half the price we paid. What this meal felt like was a gouging exercise. At no point was any of this food worth more than $40 per person. At no point did this really taste like anything better than Olive Garden.

This bill was high enough to force me to get cash out on behalf of my partner. Some reading this may think that we shouldn't go out if I didn't have enough for this meal.. Mind you I was prepared to spend $100 on non prix-fixe, which according to the standard menu (consult it, it looks fantastic) would be more than enough to eat an excellent meal.

After paying and walking out, we noticed the little chalkboard outside that said ""Valentines day meal - $70/ person."" Gee, thanks for the heads up.

I had enough cash in my wallet for a reasonable meal near anywhere else - I was expecting to take some home with me after tipping. Instead I had no room to tip and frankly no desire to - your unethical approach to what should be a pleasant meal effectively sunk all of my liquid cash for the next 3 days and ruined our valentines day. Instead of reflecting on our love, we're now bickering about how to pay for our food for the rest of the week.

How could you have prevented this? Be upfront about Prix fixe (put it on Facebook/ your website, tell me when YOU CALL ME TO CHANGE THE DAMN RESERVATION), and if you're going to charge an arm and a leg, you had best plate an entire arm and leg (per head). I heard great things but will now only ever attempt to dissuade anyone contemplating eating your food. 

For a place that proudly sports the tagline ""Inexpensive Italian"" I can't imagine why you'd nickel and dime Philadelphians for a meal that would lose in a contest against Carrabas.

I think they have a reasonably small corkage fee for wine/6packs/etc. and while $50 seemed semi steep I guess its not too bad to bring a whole keg to a restaurant.

When you hear that many glowing reviews and it doesn't live up to the hype, you wonder what planet the other reviewers live on (reminds me of the big disappointment Federal Donuts.)  It was OK. That's all. The best bisque I've had in town, BTW: Seafood Bisque at Bistro Romano, though they rarely seem to have it.
Our main courses were vastly better. I had a New York Strip with a blue cheese butter topping. It was a la carte, so I ordered a side of mashed potatoes for $3 extra- not unreasonable at all. The steak was very good- a good piece of meat. I mixed some of the blue cheese butter with the potatoes, and it was delicious. My GF got the Filet Oscar, which was a filet mignon with crabmeat, asparagus, and hollandaise sauce on the side. She was very pleased with her selection, and ate it all. 
We both commented that, while the bisque was a letdown, the main course made up for it. We would go back to Marmont, though we're not falling over ourselves to do so.",2012-05-08 23:28:52,"{'food': ['crab bisque soup', 'New York Strip', 'Filet Oscar'], 'drink': []}"

I'm a total sugar and chocolate addict and always looking for a great bakery, something other than the thousand Italian bakeries that seem to abound in the Philly area. 

I bought 4 items on my first trip (and all within the limits of my $10 Groupon!)  I got a specialty pastry called a ""marjolaine,""  a chocolate/chocolate cupcake, a hazelnut cake slice, and a complimentary double chocolate brownie-cookie drop with vanilla glaze (because I actually came a little under the $10 and they wanted to make up for it.)  Very friendly service from the one woman I dealt with on a Thursday afternoon.

I ate the cookie first. Very ""meh."" It was dry except for the embedded chocolate chips. You can make much better at home using the Baker's Chocolate Drops recipe found on the back of their unsweetened baking chocolate, very easy to do, just add a generic confectioners glaze.

Next I tried their specialty marjolaine, priced at $4.99, so I expected it to be good. This is a four layer hazelnut meringue filled with hazelnut and chocolate cream, a bit of jam, and covered with a chocolate glaze. Again, I was underwhelmed and had a hard time pinpointing why. Ultimately, I found it to be too rich and too sweet (half a slice made me sick to my stomach) but without a whole lot of actual flavor. The chocolate glaze quality was pretty good though. 

Next I tried the cupcake. And I found myself asking, what do the following have in common:
1. Sahara
2. Mohave
3. Death Valley
4. This cupcake

You guessed it - dry dry dry! And the frosting was airy nothingness. I threw part of it away. Why do people bother to make cupcakes that aren't moist yumminess? If you want cupcakes, go to Brown Betty. End of story.

Finally, the hazelnut cake square. Again, a lot of airy sweet nothingness, very unsatisfying. (In fact, the bakery box, when it held just the cupcake and cake square, weighed almost nothing. The marjolaine was the only hefty pastry.)

This place reminds me of many of the local Italian bakeries, because their cakes tend to be a lot of airy sweetness as well. I was hoping for something different given the ""Swiss"" designation.

It was Tuesday night and we didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was packed. The hostess accommodated us nicely. There was so many good things on the menu! The Hot Fried Chicken was nestled on a piece of white bread with ranch dressing, dill, pickles and hot sauce.  Delicious.  My only recommendation is to warn people up front about the level of heat- it was just a tad bit much for me. But no worries, easy to fix- I'll just hold the hot sauce the next time.  

The pulled pork was a vinegar based pork and the pork belly and beans were delicious as well. The mac and cheese was too much roux and not enough cheese. The butternut soup was smooth- but then I bit into the pumpkin seeds- not a good combo. I had to slurp and chew; it just confused my mouth. But, the dish that was near perfection was the ""roasted root vegetables."" Very clean and simply cooked. The food overall was wonderful, the staff were pleasant, and the ambiance was very nice.

I must admit that at times I do wonder ""Why do I come here so often?  Am I stuck in a rut?"" And then the I put the first forkful of this exquisitely simple (read 'authentic') but oh so delectable cibo italiano in my mouth and all questioning ceases. Tre Scalini's Italian-born chef-owner Franca is dedicated to the art of la cucina italiana.  So much so that she NEVER leaves the kitchen and chooses to close the place if she ever takes a vacation rather than leave the cooking to others  ..now that's dedication!. Her food is high art, but derived from the Molise kitchens, it is ever so accessible.  No fancy over creamed sauces, over stuffed meats or fishes, or layered sculptures of eclectic ingredients here - it is simplicity as art.   

The authenticity of Tre Scalini's food almost demands that you eat in the Italian way: beginning with antipasti, primi (pasta), secondi (fish or meat), contorni, and dolci.  Ask for appetizer portions of the pasta if you think this is too much food. (Too much? Ha! Wait till you taste it!).  

My favorites (although there is no 'wrong' choice here): 
Appetizers:  Melenzana alla Napolitano, so simple and soooo good; a sometimes offering of broccoli rabe with cannellini, chopped bread, garlic and oil; Cannellini mussles and calamari in a tomato broth served over a crust of bread; Burrata (fresh buttery cheese) and prosciutto; Mussles.  
Pasta : Anything over Spaghetti alla chittara ...Marinara, Tomato-Basil, Clams, but I especially love the Aglio e Olio, with hot pepper flakes, anchovies and capers or olives.  Squid ink papardelle with prawns and crab meat; Papardelle with mushrooms and truffle oil ...ayayaya!   
Fish: Branzino, steamed with Livornese sauce (chopped tomatoes, olives and olive oil); Pepper crusted tuna (sushi grade RARE! ) ...if they have it;  Zuppa di Pesce.  Clams, calamari, mussles, and sea bass or red snapper in a simple tomato-based broth.  
Meat: I never order chicken out, but Franca's Pollo alla Veneziana is worth breaking that rule; the Vitello alla Napolitana is delicate and delightful, made like the eggplant, pan cooked in olive oil with a simple tomato-oil sauce with a dusting of Parmigiano. The signature dish here is the veal loin medallions with mushrooms; the filet mignon of the veal.

Here's a potentially controversial statement: Mexican food in Philly hasn't impressed me yet... wait for it... until last night! Xochitl is so far my favorite Mexican in the city, and yes that means I prefer it over El Vez, El Rey, Lolita, Tequilas, Cantina Los Caballitos, and Cantina Dos Segundos. I'm not saying these places aren't good... but I am saying that to me, they're not as good as Xochitl.

Guacamole. El Vez boasts an incredible Guac experience - the ""make your own"" is Xo superior at Xochitl. Ours had black truffle, plum tomatoes, roasted garlic, amazing cheese, and maybe some other things - there was so much to choose from and all of it was so good. The black truffle was better than I ever would have expected (I don't regularly ride the truffle train). Came with a ton of chips - it filled me up (party of 2). Restrain yourself from finishing it all otherwise it'll spoil your appetite like it did for me.

There's a $28 special - you get a bunch of delicious ingredients (meats, veggies, cheeses) and tortillas and then you get to make your own tacos. Pretty sweet deal... but we didn't do that. Instead, we opted for the normal taco plates (we'll try the standard dinner options next time, and there's definitely a next time). 

I had brisket. She had fish. Yowzers. All so, so good. The fish taco has cabbage that's got tremendous flavor and crunch (vinegar). The taco itself has a tiny kick of heat; always appreciated. Brisket taco was just damn good. Best tacos I've had in the city so far. Only needed one after all the guac but ate one brisket and one fish and was stuffed.

Server also recommended some sides: Esquites (Mexican Sweet Corn) and Rice & Manchego (what our server referred to as Mexican Mac 'N Cheese). If I have to bother explaining how awesome these were after just reading sweet corn and mac 'n cheese, then either this place isn't for you or you dislike corn and/or mac n' cheese. If that's the case, then I ask - do you like food? Really? =)

Didn't want to order dessert but saw chocolate tres leches and had to have it. Wasn't as good as the tres leches that Valanni used to serve but it was delicious nonetheless, and not overly sweet. Great texture, would have loved to see that tempting puddle of milk at the bottom of the cake, but it was good in its own right. I'm hungry just thinking about Xochitl - it was Xo Xo good.

To be fair, I did go during the early morning hours on Sunday as the Saturday night bar crowd was heading home, but it was unacceptably unorganized. There was absolutely no system in place for the deli counter which created a HUGE crowd of restless drunk people. The employees were not calling out any numbers as the food was prepared, so no one could tell if their sandwiches were ready. Everyone was just standing around trying to figure out when they would be getting their Mac n Cheese so that they could finally escape the chaos and head home. It was a mob scene that could have easily been avoided if the employees had just yelled out order numbers as the food was ready instead of forcing people to squeeze their way to the front of the crowd to check on the status of their order.

I recommend anything that comes with fries because their fries are bangin'. They are the shoestring kind so you have to be a fan of the thinner fries in order to enjoy them. They also have yummy mac and cheese which tastes very homemade. As with most bars, you can't go wrong with their burger. Mine was cooked well and was flavorful and juicy.

Stepping in, we perused the menu on the wall to the left, and made a selection.

We collected our soup with the fixings (bean sprouts, jalapeño peppers, and basil) and grabbed our spoons and chopsticks.

For starters, the pho was large enough to properly feed 2, so if you plan on having a bowl, come hungry! The broth was very tasty and light. The noodles were the perfect texture and I appreciated that they were generous with the steak and brisket - both of which were nice and tender.

A couple things to note: each location of Federal Donuts has a different menu of fancy donuts, so it's advisable to check the menu on the website before you go.

You can tell the Bloody Mary is made from a mix, and they don't use enough horseradish or spice for my taste.  But the mimosas were good!  I'm not sure if they offer pitchers during brunch, which would have been nice given that we had a few drinks with our meal, and this increased our bill significantly.

The service was well above average. Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable, but no one really seemed thrilled to be working there.

The food was just OK. The lunch menu is small and offers unique items as well as chic upgrades on classics, such as ($15-17) burgers. The entrée portions are generous and plate presentation looked nice.

The complimentary truffle popcorn was possibly the most flavorful thing I ate here. I tried the bacon-wrapped dates. They were yummy, but honestly I couldn't taste much besides the bacon...and I got them because of the goat cheese (where was it?). I also tried the crab and avocado toast (the sourdough was perfect), and had the black bean burger lunch combo.

The ""burger"" itself had a great flavor, but it was a tad dry and completely fell apart. I ate most of it with a fork. (Someone else got the same thing and his was fine, so maybe mine was a fluke.) It was served with fried zucchini, which was so greasy I couldn't finish it. The dipping sauce was nondescript and bland. I chose the soup of the day as my starter, which was carrot gazpacho -- not bad, definitely interesting...but a little strange as a gazpacho, in my opinion. The cookie of the day was oatmeal chocolate chip. It was huge and soft, but not very exciting...the flavor was missing something.

Just a head's up: the restrooms are not inside the restaurant. You go out a side door, up the stairs, on to another floor in the building...and then you have to remember which unmarked door to go back through. It was a little odd.

From the first bite I could tell that this place knew how to cook lamb for once.

Came back again for some more take out a few days later and then the next day and they remembered who I was.  I like when you go to a restaurant and it has the feeling that you welcome and respected.  I ordered the lamb shank with vegetables.  Perfect.  The lamb was fresh and tender, coming right off the bone like lamb should be. The the vegetables,beans, potatoes and rice all had a distinct flavor. The rice you could tell was not of cheap quality because it didn't turn into mush when you ate it.  We never ran out of water to drink and bread to dip in the sauce.  

Bottom Line-  The owners care about the food, fast service, food is all home made except the fries good for lunch because its cheaper.

P.S if you come to a family owned restaurant right before they close and complain about them not serving you.

They actually skipped the whiskey as the prices were about double what they usually would pay (a 1 oz. pour was priced the same as what a normal 2 oz. pour would cost).  Not sure if VW is going to be able to get away with that but I guess we'll see.  Had the Kentucky Fried Quail, which was very well seasoned.  Also had the short rib and duck fat-fried fries in a Sly Fox cheddar sauce.  Those were pretty awesome, definitely the best thing anyone at our table had that night.  I'd like to go back and try the burger (not the $24 one).  Considering it was their second night, I thought service was ok.

Our waiter Tony was pretty awesome. Normally I wouldn't remember our servers name. But he repeated it enough for it to stick in my head. Being our first time at Bareburger, he explained the items on the menu and told us which stood out the most. 

We got the Bison and Elk... They were definitely a different texture from the normal cheeseburgers you get. The meat was very soft and tender. We also got the fries and rings with the sauce. If you want the one with the sauce, make sure you order that one. Because there's a regular fries/rings and fries/rings with sauce (i saw a snobby woman at the table next to me pretty much demanding for her sauce. I say., she prolly ordered the wrong one). Anyways, they have four types of sauce., which i forgot and too lazy to google it back up.. But you'll see it on the menu. We also got the ginger green tea. The ginger was very powerful. Enough for me to forget that it was tea that i ordered and not ginger ice water. 

Why three stars? The portions quite small. And the prices are a little bit on the higher side. 2 burgers, fries/rings, and 2 green tea for a little over $40.

The burgers here are just great.  There is a good selection of toppings which makes it a little more interactive than your average burger joint.  My biggest complaint is that the place is so small so the wait sometimes gets long, especially if you're in a group larger than 3 or 4 guests.

The village burger was spot on.  Tasty, cooked just as I ordered (medium rare), and filling enough.  Flavorful beef and juicy enough to get all over my hands and make the bun soggy.  Perfect.

The BBQ pork sandwich was pretty good, but not the best.  I'm from Kansas City so I'm a tough critic.  Not the star of the menu, but definitely not bad.

The veggie burger is one of the best that I've had.  My only complaint is that it is very temperamental.  The patty is formed so softly (black bean and lentil) that as you take a bite it squeezes most of the burger out of the back.  Overall though, it's fantastic.  The guac and cabbage are nice additions.

The short rib and cheddar french fries.  OMG.  Are you kidding, JG?  These things are ridiculous.  I'm lucky to even have eaten more than two because my wife devoured them (enough so that the combination of this and the whiskey ended up in the toilet the next morning).

The concept is so fresh, so exciting, so in demand. The follow through is anything but. Their menu appears, fresh, healthy, fun and VEGAN. How could one go wrong in the city full of Cheesesteaks with a healthy alternative. The answer; Very. First of all there is a huge misconception that this spot it healthy, there menu has a spattering of healthy options, that is dosed in unhealthy sauces, creams, dressings and fried items. These 'addition's' make many of their items anything BUT healthy. Healthy done right are places like Pure Fare and Sweetgreen, this is not one. 

My third experience. I was craving something filling and healthy and was walking around Rittenhouse, when I thought I would give Hip City another try. I walked in to give their menu a ponder and was pleasantly greeted by a special Quinoa Chili they were featuring for the day. I decided to order one (it was exactly what I was craving) and was excited to enjoy what seemed like my first pleasant experience here.

But this is Hip City, nothing ever runs smoothly (even after being open for months) and after placing my order and paying I was told they actually ran out of Chili, and she suggested I can come back in an hour to get some if I want. I was not going to wait an hour to eat so I decided to try something else on the menu, so I ordered their Buffalo Bella and attempted to make it healthier by having it wrapped in a tortilla rather than on a 'hamburger bun'. I waited in their disorderly line and received the sandwich to go. 

I did not wait long to dive in, I was hungry and was looking forward to what I had ordered. When I first opened the wrapping I was slightly alarmed, there was Buffalo sauce slathered all over the outside of the wrap, and I became nervous that my Portabello wrap turned into a Buffalo Sauce Wrap. Indeed it had, after my first bite I discovered that the wrap was DRENCHED in their unhealthy and overpowering sauce with a smattering of the celery slaw and there was an extremely small portion of Portobella. Basically I had a fattening saucy, greasy wrap on my hands and yea it was Vegan, but it was anything but healthy, flavorful or refreshing. After about 3 more bites  I decided there was no way I could eat anymore of my WaWa quality sandwich and picked out the two Portobella mushrooms and threw the rest away. 

My local WaWa would do a better take on this sandwich, somehow manage to make it faster and it would not cost $10 a pop either. This place does NOTHING to impress. I think Ill stick to Sweetgreen.",2012-11-15 22:40:30,"{'food': ['Quinoa Chili'], 'drink': []}"

As it was a bit early for wine this A.M. (and I feel guilty paying $10.00 for a white-table cloth lunch where the owner is probably breaking even) my wife and I spit an app of Calamari Fritti for an extra ten spot.  Ice Teas were three bucks each, but happily refilled.  Fresh, warm crusty bread was quickly brought along with a nice olive oil / balsamic vinegar.

There were maybe three outdoor tables filled and one other couple came inside at dead noon ( a 66F November day.)  I'd have expected more foot traffic in Manayunk considering this weather, but the single server accommodated us all cheerfully, and we never felt rushed nor that we had to wait for anything.

The calamari were more than enough for two, and served with a homemade Marinara.  Though I would have preferred them a LITTLE more crispy, the breading was delicate, and light.

My wife had veal medallions with truffles in a cream-based sauce, and I had chicken and sausage in a velouté.  The chicken were roughly cut chunks of thigh (which were more moist and flavorful than the typical breast served with this kind of dish.)   The Italian sausage appeared as those little tiny hunks you usually find on pizza slices, but it was obviously a nice quality medium sausage.

Both dishes appeared PIPING hot from the kitchen accompanied by a trio of polenta (just a dab), zucchini lightly sauteed, with a hint of crispness flavored by tiny hunks of fresh roasted garlic.  Also, a few slices of thick but tender sweet carrots scented with a touch of fennel seed,

Portions were dinner-sized and neither of us could imagine dessert after cleaning our plates with the remainder of the bread.

Sauces were quite subtle (I could not detect the rosemary mentioned on the menu) but obviously lovingly prepared.

You really can't go wrong with a lunch here (and even at dinner, the same entrees top out at around $21 for NY Strip or Fish of the day.)

I was given one price on the phone, when the driver came he gave me a different price. I was given regular jerk ck, I asked for BBQ (no big deal, I have BBQ sauce here), they gave me 2 pieces. The first piece was a thigh (a lil dry but I worked with it, hunger), the second piece was this little dried up drum stick hard & wiry as an old leather shoe!! I could not eat it at all!! A huge disappointment!!  

Soooo, (1st call) I called them once again I told her about the pricing situation, she said she made a mistake and gave me the wrong price (so when you realized that you should've called me back to let me know), (2nd call) about this ck that I cannot eat, these freaking greens that you had to of dropped an entire box of salt in & sold them any way.
The female tells me that the owners will telephone me tomorrow... I'm flabbergasted ... That was 2 weeks ago, I'm still waiting for their call.... will update when they finally call me... Twenty something dollars down the drain~~~


 I always try to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt. Especially certain ones. I definitely give them constructive criticism, because I want to see them prosper. So, I tell them about the areas they can do better in, based on my personal experiences. Customer service is very important, consistency, quality just to name a few things that are core to owning a restaurant. I hope this review has helped. The food is good. I suggest eating in...

I migrated from Malaysia 30+ years ago and was overjoyed when Penang opened about 17 years ago in Philadelphia to satisfy our home-sickness for Malaysian food. The quality and taste was superb even compared to Malaysia. 

We noticed some slight changes over this past summer when we last visited but did not think much about it. But yesterday, our dinner had not just degraded, it tasted terrible. Apparently, there are now new owners and we also noticed all new service staff that we had not recognized before.

We talked to the waiter and then to the owner (or maybe one of the owners).  That was a second disappointment. We learned that the new staff and new owner(s) are not Malaysians. Also instead of listening to what we say about the food about not tasting right, we only got adamant excuses that the cooking staff is the ""same"" staff. We did not leave believing that they cared about what we (Malaysians that have patronized Penang since it opened)  had to say about the food we just had, to correct the situation.

We then also noticed that there were almost no other 'asian""-ethnic clientele like the usual whenever we had visited. Another bad sign for a ethnic Malaysian restaurant.

This is a sad moment for a Malaysian who loves his ethnic food. But my yearning is not going to be satisfied by Penang anymore. It was a very sad moment for my family.",2016-12-25 15:01:04,"{'food': ['Penang'], 'drink': []}"

I started with the Thai Coconut Soup. It wasn't bad, but it lacked the subtle tartness that makes good Tom Kha good. 

I always judge a Thai place based on the quality of their curries--a fundamental aspect of Thai cuisine. I ordered the Green Curry, and it can be described as a few carrots and broccoli stems floating around in a soup of watered down coconut milk.

Food: solid 4.5 star
Between the two of us we ordered Tuna Tartare to share, spinach and asparagus as sides to our main entrees of Chilean Sea Bass and Crab Cake. I know I know, no steak at a steakhouse? No regrets -- all the dishes were very memorable. 
First off, the tuna tartare was tossed with a sesame soy sauce, with a lemon on the side if you so wish (wrapped in a cheese cloth so the seeds don't come out.. fancy!). I liked that they were full chunks of tuna, where as some places mince up the tartare quite thin. The tuna was really fresh, some of the best I've ever had. $18
My chilean sea bass $41 was cooked very well. It had a nice crisp texture on the outside, miso glaze and , moist and that naturally chilean buttery flakeyness on the inside. My partners $39 jumbo lump crab cakes were very good -- coming from a proud Marylander -- these were very good crab cakes. JUST enough breading to keep the crab cake together, the rest all lump crabmeat , as it should be! Both spinach and asparagus were good as in they were well cooked, and accompanied well to the meal itself.

Service- 4 stars. It started off a bit slow -- took a while for a server to come over to us, even though we were the only ones at the restaurant at the time. Not sure if it was the way we were dressed ( sorry but we're not going to suit up in 100% humidity!) I understand it's hard not to judge, and maybe we weren't dressed up highly enough for this swanky place but treat all guests equally right? Anyway once we got started, the server was very professional. Explained the specials very well, came over at appropriate times to check on our drinks/meal . The order time to appetizer, and then following entree to table was perfect timing. 

Ambiance - like i said above. Swanky! Very fancy, gorgeous decor and very comfortable, as I like to call them "" executive chairs."" 

Price/value - 3.5 stars 
As I stated above, the food is quite phenomenal but let's break it down a bit. Entrees were very good, and alright they're a bit above the price range for competing restaurants, but they were also very well executed . Enough to justify the mark up? That's very subjective, and for me it's right on the brink of being acceptable. The vegetables though are what pushes everything over the edge. You would think with a $40 entree ( or I would think..) maybe it comes with a side, maybe? Nope. So this turns a $40 entree + $10-12 side to technically a $50+ full meal (this is without an appetizer). So if you compare to competing restaurants that lets say have Chilean Sea bass as an entree for $35 ( I loved Matysons) , it's actually a $20 difference given theirs comes with a side.. etc. Being a bit nit picky, but just wanted to break it down. To me, it's very hard to justify a $12 side, when that's a whole gnocchi dish somewhere else! But again, everyone's price/value/financial standpoint differs. 

I do think this is a great place for an anniversary, and any other fancy celebratory reasons. The food and service you will receive wont disappoint. Just be ready to break the wallet a little. 1 app, 3 drinks, 2 entrees, 2 sides roughly $200 between 2 folks to give ya a ballpark estimate",2015-07-09 15:38:28,"{'food': [{'item': 'Tuna Tartare', 'rating': 4.5}, {'item': 'Spinach and Asparagus', 'rating': 4.5}, {'item': 'Chilean Sea Bass', 'rating': 4.5}, {'item': 'Crab Cake', 'rating': 4.5}], 'drink': []}"

Seriously, if it one day closes shop, my view of the gayborhood would have been altered. That being said, it is not my top choice for a casual meal. 

There's not much wrong with the food. Sunday brunch in here is actually great. I love their eggs benedict especially when the potatoes also come out eggy with a slice of melon. They do brunch well. Their regular menu seems to be trying a bit hard with vamped up diner food and a large dessert menu. They could have done better as two separate entities than being a two headed monster. After ordering a standard entree, there's never room for dessert and have you seen how big the desserts are? 

For a restaurant with so many burgers and sandwiches, they don't have regular fries but less than ideal wedge cut fries that are hardly crispy. I can't recommend the burgers too much anyhow, there's nothing special about them. They usually come without condiment, someone should try to make a burger sauce or some kind of aioli that you put on the side. My favorite thing on the menu would have to be the tried and true cosmopolitan salad with grilled or fried chicken depending on if you want to be bad that day. They have pretty good soup, their chicken salad sandwich comes with grapes is also quite tasty. The quesadilla and various grilled sandwich is also recommendable but do come for the brunch. (Maybe they have a different weekend chef) The ice cream is from Bassett's and it's quite good in quality. My favorite flavor is black cherry which the Reading Terminal Bassett doesn't even carry. Their huge apple pie is big enough for three people to share preferably a la mode. There are also cheesecake with creative flavors on rotation.

The employees are friendly but they also demonstrate standard gay behavior, you know you are being read when you seat that. Also they rather chitchat amongst themselves than to serve their customers. For a year or so, they had a front door that is really hard to open. God knows how many customers can't open the door and gave up or thought they were closed.

I had been hearing that Honey's was THE BEST brunch in Philadelphia from a few sources I trust, and wanted to check it out.   Luckily for me, my favorite Yelp-le (yelp couple), Ali E. and Jack I., were up for the shared visit.  We arrived, put our names down, and saw Monica S. also waiting -- if she's there, ya know it's good (shameless plug for Elite status). 

We go for chai at Random Tea House, come back, and are waiting waiting waiting...so I go in and check with the host -- he had radioed over there but when we didn't come over he didn't feel the need to check for us outside.  Obviously after waiting as long as we did, we would have just left.   So he sits us at the counter.  Fine.  

I look at the menu and want something more Jewish than southern... so many choices.  It's at that moment that I had a brilliant idea that may have changed brunch for me forever.

Food comes out and I'm in heaven.

I ordered the SS Crab, which seems to be a formerly popular item that has returned to the menu. I liked how I was given the option between white and brown rice -- although not customarily used in sushi, brown rice gives the option of cutting some of the empty carbs from the sushi burrito. It had a tangy sauce that I liked (it might've just been spicy mayo), and also the pickled red onions added a nice crunch.

Perhaps the biggest con for me was the price -- after tax and everything, my sushirito turned out to be about $15 (??!!) To be fair, this was the most expensive sushi burrito they had (it was around $13, and most were $10 or below), their sushi bowls seemed larger and more worth for the price, and also sushi is always on the pricier side. Still, I guess I expected more crab meat and less crispy crab coating for the price and all the signs they had around the store promoting the return of this item to the menu.

All in all though, it was still an enjoyable and quality meal! Everything was made really fresh (when i came, they were still cooking the crab). It's the kind of place worth trying, but I wouldn't eat here regularly (for the sake of my wallet), or I would at least order one of the less expensive items (that maybe has fish instead of crab).",2017-08-02 21:01:11,"{'food': ['SS Crab', 'Sushi Bowl'], 'drink': []}"

Tonights saturday night dinner was an uncomfortable dining experience where I was the ""minority""...and by ""minority"", I'm referring to mostly the style of dress.  When I go out to a restaurant in the city, I expect something of a dress code, unless I know I'm going to a dive bar or hipster foodie place.  But to go to the top of the 2 Liberty building, where this has been described as one of the most romantic views of the city, you don't expect to see t-shirts, baggy jeans and running/basketball shoes.  I thought maybe there was a special party or group there taking over the place for the night, but the staff assured me it was just a normal Saturday night.  We were having dinner with out of town friends, who wanted a fine dining experience in the ""big city"" (they're from Scranton""), and had heard from one of their friends about the view here.  I was a little uncomfortable as the clientele had a certain attitude and there were more than a few foursome+ of young males sitting around the bar just staring at the diners.  My guests were visibly uncomfortable, she kept her purse on her lap for most of dinner.  These are all trivial and little things by themselves, but add up to make a really bad dining experience.

So, enough about the ambiance, and onto the food.  Well, can't really say, after a really uncomfortable 15 minutes at the bar, we felt so out of place with the environment, that we rushed through the meal to leave as soon as we could.  From previous dining experiences here (admittedly, the last time I ate here was over 3 years ago), I remember an awesome mac & cheese dish, a better than average steak, and a few appetizers worth coming back for.  But none of that matters, because I wouldn't return for dinner here under any circumstances, and if you care enough about your dining experience to read yelp, you won't be eating here either.",2013-10-20 19:58:52,"{'food': ['mac & cheese', 'steak'], 'drink': []}"

They always had great music, eclectic art, yum hot drinks (esp their spicy ginger chai!), fresh vegan, veggie and meat eater food options...and usually friendly solid service.  The pets add a nice warm component to the whole vibe as well.  I would see neighbors stopping in for a cup of coffee on their morning walks.  Nice.  Really nice.  

When I was in school I came here around 3+ times a wk and would eat half a dozen meals in their sunny window seat.  I wrote a book in this place...  

BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG!  I came back from boston (not exactly the warmest of cities) and now the staff's too cool for school.  I'm used to the hipster attitude but really...no ""hello"", no eye contact, not one smile or acknowledgment that I'm talking to you and trying to order a 4$ chai latte?  I really tried last time.  I ended up laughing at myself outloud as the girl behind the counter completely ignored what I said and turned around.  I was literally embarrassed.  To top it off now my favorite ginger chai is watered down, mostly milk and served luke warm... Where's the spice and ginger?  No more fun spicy lentil pasta side dishes and the attitude...god the attitude!  I can't believe other reviewers say they're friendly.  They must be part of some special club or I keep missing the nice baristas.  I've tried 3x in the past 2 weeks to get back to loving Redhook but I think that last episode did me in.

The food.  The ambience, the ginger chai - This place was created to be amazing.  I bragged about Redhook in the neighborhood.

To the new Redhook fans, I really wish you tried it a couple years ago.  Everything was better then.  Wish the old owner would come back. Its such a great spot!

We got the spicy Thai chicken and king pork BBQ. Both were good but nothing extremely spectacular. The rice that comes with the Thai chicken though stole the show in that entree. It's soaked or seasoned with some sort of chicken flavoring that elevates it above regular jasmine rice. The Thai chicken was tasty but the chicken itself didn't have much flavor. The king pork bbq was tasty but nothing unique. Both were relatively average sized portions. The other people we went with seemed to have ordered noodles or curry with larger portion sizes and they seemed to have been very impressed. Maybe next time we'll go back and try something different that Penang is more known for.,2018-09-30 01:21:04,"{'food': ['Roti', 'Thai chicken', 'King pork BBQ'], 'drink': []}"

I, on the other hand, went in a not so busy Sunday afternoon and had a great waitress and not at all a long wait for the food. I even checked in and got a free collard caesar salad ;)

My husband and I went here for a late lunch/dinner and ordered the Pickled Fried Chicken and he ordered the Wiki Wiki both were absolutely delicious!  The size of the burger was also nice (too big can just get overwhelming and you can't enjoy your sides!) We also ordered spicy pickles and the rings and fries.  The fries come with assorted sauces which were all fantastic!

We both really loved it, and are both really happy they use farm raised/cage free/hormone free animals.  Everything down to the soda you order is purified water and natural sugars!  They also have many veggie options which is really friendly!

Overall, yummy food, environmentally friendly and locally sourced!  On top of that, so many options!  We will definitely be back to try more!",2016-08-08 01:39:43,"{'food': ['Pickled Fried Chicken', 'Wiki Wiki', 'Spicy Pickles', 'Rings', 'Fries'], 'drink': []}"

Besides the two of us there were 3 or 4 other people at the bar. We got two drinks each. I had the Jack and Wendy - sour, absolutely delicious - and the penicillin, which was also very tasty. Music was good and at a good volume and we had fantastic service. I now wanna go back in a busier night, because the great drinks I had at Lloyd deserve to be shared with more people.

My wife and I tried a large variety of appetizers including the Vegetable Pakora (spiced and lightly fried in batter), Vegetable Samosa, and Aloo Tikki (fried spiced patties) along with some Naan.

All of the above appetizers were delicious and we felt the Samosa and Tikki had the same insides, but prepared in different manners.  The Pakora was not over fried and really tasted nice.

For my main meal, I had the Lamb Karahi (w/fresh tomatoes, herbs, and pepper).  wife had Chicken Tikka Marsala.  I asked for spicy, wife did not.  The color was quite a vibrant red with the Tikka Marsala and we both felt it had too much of a cream flavor which was overpowering.  After the chicken was all gone, there was still quite a bit of the sauce left.  Since I asked for spicy the wife did not even try it.  It had a lot of lamb and I felt it could have been even hotter.  Tasty, though.

As others have said, there is hardly any ambiance here as a sit-down restaurant.  Very basic tables, uncomfortable chairs, and a view of some refrigerators for sodas and desserts.  There is a television.  A few others came in for sit-down meals,  but I think this is a better take-out place.

Overall, for Indian food this is a good choice!",2015-02-08 19:48:15,"{'food': ['Vegetable Pakora', 'Vegetable Samosa', 'Aloo Tikki'], 'drink': []}"
