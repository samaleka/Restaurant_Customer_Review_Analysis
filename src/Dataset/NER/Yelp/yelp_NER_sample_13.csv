1. It is one of the larger dining rooms on Passyunk Ave, so it was a good choice for a large group

2. The bill was fairly inexpensive and the wait staff was accommodating
3. It was family friendly.  A few of my friends had small children and there were other tables with families, so it is a nice option for something casual if you have children and want to go out on Passyunk.

Now, on to the negatives:

1. The pizza dough was frozen!  We literally saw a staffer bring up stacks of frozen pizza dough from the basement through the dining room.  Not the way to make a good impression when you have Birra, Brigantessa, Stogie Joe's and Marra's all within short walking distance.  Not to mention almost every pie that we ordered was burnt on the bottom.  The sauce and cheese were decent, but the crust just had that unmistakeable frozen quality to it.  

2. The antipasto dish clearly came from a jar.  The artichoke hearts, mushrooms and roasted red peppers looked exactly like what you would see coming out of a jar....limp, covered in oil, etc.  

3.  The place is a BYOB.....yet they brought out small rocks glasses for our wine.  When asked if we could get some proper wine glasses (there were 8 adults and multiple bottles of wine after all), we were informed that they only have 4 wine glasses at the restaurant!  Really?   

With the over-abundance of quality restaurants on Passyunk Ave, I see no reason to ever go back here, especially with the aforementioned quality pizza places all within walking distance.",2015-08-12 14:56:07,"{'food': ['pizza dough', 'antipasto dish'], 'drink': ['wine']}"

I also own one of Chef Marc Vetri's fabulous cookbooks ""Il Viaggo Di Vetri.""The townhouse which is home to the restaurant is cozy, warm, and intimate. I loved the chandelier from Murano in the center of the dining room. I was very impressed with the personalized tasting menu format. After a conversation on the phone to confirm dinner and also with a waitress prior to the meal, regarding culinary lines, dislikes, dietary restrictions, and personal preferences, I feel my dinner was perfectly prepared for me. I enjoyed every course. Chef Joel Myers nailed it!! The rustic Italian fare offered innovative flavors, delightful and unique  handcrafted pasta, and delicious decadent desserts. I especially enjoyed the seasonal vegetables, persimmon salad, zucca caramelle, chestnut fettuccine with wild boar ragu, corzetti with charred Trevino ragu, salted crusted Branzino, and the chocolate polenta souffle. The vegetables and fruit were seasonal and fresh. The grains used in the pasta, bread, and pastry are house milled. I also enjoyed local cheese before the dolce course. I highly recommend selecting the wine pairing to elevate the dining experience. Wines are specifically paired and compliment explosive-flavored entr√©s from the chef's tasting menu. I appreciated the attention to detail such as the proper flatware for each course and the varietal-specific stemware. I also enjoyed the to-go bag with yummy biscotti. The restaurant and service is gracious and they desire to please. The dining experience at Vetri reminds me of similar experiences at Michelin-starred restaurants in Europe but the service flow wasn't as fluid or smooth. Expect a fabulous meal.  This restaurant has heart and soul.  I appreciated not being rushed during the meal or feeling pressure (like most US restaurants) that the tables need to turn. Enjoy and appreciate the total dining-experience at Vetri. (PS...bring a healthy appetite because this is an epic feast!)  The perfect place to dine to celebrate a special occasion. The classes (taught upstairs) look amazing. For information check Vetricucina.com. www.vetriristorante.com @vetricucina",2016-11-28 18:33:11,"{'food': ['pasta', 'bread', 'pastry'], 'drink': []}"

The steaks are usually well cooked here, but they are always too buttery for my taste. I much prefer the char on steaks at Capital Grille (if I'm looking for a chain steak place). The lobster bisque is on the salty side, and the sides are usually drenched in butter or cream as well.

No tikki masala, no saag paneer - nope, none of that.  Instead, TiffinEtc was a wonderful way to spend my lunch hour and my coveted lunch money.

I split three dishes with a friend, and this was the perfect amount.  First, the Indian Pizza.  We split a personal sized Saag Paneer pizza - the size would have been perfect for one very hungry person as your only meal.  The pizza was pretty good - I would only give it a three, but that might be because I was spoiled by amazing Indian Pizza when I lived in SF (http://www.zantespizza.com/).   There was a bit too much ricotta and not enough strong indian flavoring for my taste.

Next we had the Gobhi Paratha, which was pretty fantastic.  The Paratha was a bit soggy, but not terribly so.  The innards of onions and cauliflower were amazing and the chutney was great (although not plentiful enough).  The raita was bizarrely tangy - I'm not sure if that was intentional or not, but it wasn't my thing.

Finally, we had a Masala Aloo Kati rolls, which were fantastic.  It was basically an indian burrito (or is a burrito a mexican kati?) with delicious spicing and amazing potatoes.

KnQP9cTOy0eb8fJ_bt2wTg,BQgWjCw1J-GjIcKDhJXHLQ,-ATiAtTikuGuqvaW2O6tNA,2,2,2,0,"I have eaten at Marathon (this location) more times than I care to admit, and I have no earthly idea why I kept coming back.  I used to live and work in the neighborhood, and it is convenient, but looking back, there are SO many other convenient places that (1) serve better food, (2) have better service, or (3) both.

Really, there are two Marathons here, and they each deserve a review.  There is the weekday lunch Marathon and the weekday evening/weekend Marathon.  It's almost as though these restaurants are the alter-ego of one another, and just happen to share space.  Very strange.

During the week and the lunch rush, Marathon is not a bad choice.  They are crowded and rushed, but the food gets out pretty fast (and generally correctly) and the tables turn quickly.  To accommodate the largest number of patrons, they do have tables packed so tightly together that you can literally hear entire conversations from nearby tables, but it can be interesting to occasionally eavesdrop and hear about someone else's dysfunctional life for a change!  Weekday lunch is also when the ""A-team"" of servers tend to work.  The service is pretty good, despite the apparent chaos throughout the restaurant (I can only imagine working the kitchen line during a weekday lunch shift), and the food is at its peak (which while generally a plus, isn't saying much here).  I quickly learned to stick with basic stuff like sandwiches and soups (the Matzo ball rocks!), because salads (yes, salads) and more complicated entrees get messed up way too frequently.

Then there is the evening shift.  This is where things really come unglued.  If the lunch shift servers are the ""A-team,"" then this is the ""D-team.""  Most of the servers we have had in the evenings and on weekends seem like they wound up working at Marathon because pumping gas was too complicated.  In the 3 years I lived nearby and ate an occasional dinner at Marathon (apparently I am just lazy), I don't think we ever had a meal where everything was correct in our order and we enjoyed good service.  More often than not, the order was wrong in at least one way (seriously, how do you mess up a Caesar salad?), or the waiter disappeared for 20 minutes, or the temperature in the restaurant was hovering just above meat locker level.  Sandwiches with the wrong meat (yes, really), salads with the wrong dressing, and entirely wrong dishes were delivered with apathy and discourtesy on a routine basis.  On the rare occasion that I was either particularly motivated or so pissed off that I decided to speak with a manager, the line was always the same:  something about the server or kitchen staff being new/undertrained/high/mentally deficient.

And yet we returned.  Again and again.  I think the last straw was when they were changing menus a while ago and diners at our table got different menus and the server tried to explain that neither of the menus was correct but that he would tell us what the kitchen could make that night.  I love a good walking menu at a red gravy Italian joint, but at Marathon it was just too much.

I kid you not. Such a place exists right off South Street. Part of me wants to give you every last detail of our experience at Marrakesh, and yet another wants to keep quiet and let you be surprised, just as we were. In fact, we originally planned on an Italian restaurant for the night, yet we were not sad for long upon realizing it was closed because the night then took us to nearby Marrakesh, where we were absolutely delighted by every detail of the dinner.

Because life is all about expectations, and I don't want to boost yours too much, I'll divulge only select details of our experience. We were taken up to the third floor (all of us giggling all the while, thinking ""where the puck are we?""), and sat down by a server who very kindly and briefly went through the seven courses. They happily accommodated for the vegetarians at the table. Then out came course after course of deliciousness, all of which went perfectly with the red wine that we brought. Towards the end, a belly dancer came around to each of the rooms. I am only slightly ashamed to say that I was absolutely mesmerized! From what I can tell, it was very authentic dancing. Never having experienced anything like this, and having had my share of libations, I sheepishly held up a $1 bill, only to be grabbed by the hand and danced with! We were all hysterical. I slipped the bill into her waistband.

We were the only diners there for a better part of an hour. The manager even joked with us about having such a private setting.

The timing of the four courses was on-point and the wait staff was very attentive, as they came to check if everything was okay during each one of the courses. 

The food was another story. I was a little disappointed. For the First plate, I had the Foie Gras soup and it was okay. Apparently it came with a rose petal relish, but my soup did not come with it, and it needed something to cut the richness of the soup. Another issue I had with this dish, was the dish itself. The bowl i was served was cracked! Seriously? I was the only person in the restaurant having that dish at that moment. There is no excuse for cracked tableware. My girlfriend had the Beet Tartare with smoked Mackerel. It was okay. The mackerel was excellent and we wished there was more. 

Second plates: I had the escargot, shells, white bean and chorizo. It was my favorite dish of the night. It was a nice stew, and I was surprised by the amount of scargot. My girlfriend had the octopus. I tasted it. It was well cooked but nothing special.

Third plates: I had the pork belly, cheese bread pudding, and long hots. It had a good level of spice, but the fattiness of the dish turned me off a bit. My girlfriend had the rigatoni, lamb sugo dish and it was her favorite of the night, but said she wouldn't return just for that. 

Dessert: The ""fig newton"" was actually very good. My girlfriend ordered the brown butter cake. I tried it but I don't remember anything about it.

V9dzcgZ3VRRVDrE4xjIAfg,Dlt4HgnUZ51lfDe32B5EYA,-ATiAtTikuGuqvaW2O6tNA,4,0,0,0,"I had just finished my day and decided to go out for a weekday dinner with a friend, but we didn't want anyplace too fancy or fussy, and settled on Marathon Grill. Marathon is a local favorite with a few locations around Philadelphia, with good food, a nice amour of space and decent prices--it often reminds me of a modern, upscale diner. In fact, Marathon is often a brunch spot for me since their brunch quesadilla with chorizo is big and delicious!

For dinner, I opted for the Marathon Burger ($11.50). They also have the option of customizing your burger, but I went with the pre-customized menu version. The temperature of the burger was good, just a hair over medium rare, and it was amazingly juicy, greasy and messy in the best way possible--all burgers should be a little messy! For their beef, Marathon uses a blend of short rib, sirloin and chuck. The party tasted very gourmet, and because there was a blend of cuts, it had a nice amount of fat that kept the burger incredibly moist.

The tomato wasn't sliced too thick, and the lettuce was easy to take off as I don't usually like lettuce on my burgers. The applewood smoked bacon was cooked through, but still a kept some chewiness, which I love. I hate when bacon is super crisp and it's lost all of its porkiness and meatiness. On the other hand, the bacon wasn't flabby, and had a subtle smoky taste.

The BBQ sauce was slathered on the bottom half of the bread and also helped keep the sandwich moist--and wet. The sauce itself was spicy and had a nice bite to it--interesting, but in a good way. The cheese didn't have a very bold flavor, but helped the sandwich keep a creamy consistency. The sweet, caramelized onions were on point and played well with the spicy BBQ sauce, especially since there was a generous portion of them on the burger. The burger was served on a country, brioche bun that was strong enough to stand up to the heavy burger. It had a slight, pleasant sweetness to it.

I wasn't in the mood for fries, or for the other side choice of Caesar salad on the menu, so I substituted some spinach for the fries. The spinach was served in a small bowl on the burger plate and was cooked with a nice amount of garlic, though perked up a lot with some salt.

My friend ordered the Grilled Salmon ($15.50), which was glazed with a whole grain honey mustard sauce. The fish was cooked well, and stayed moist. The mustard wasn't too strong as to overpower the salmon. The mashed potatoes were super creamy and absorbed some of the juice and sauce from the salmon. The accompanying asparagus was a smaller portion, but tasted delicious. The stalks weren't mushy, and still had great texture. 

The restaurant staff was very friendly, and the servers were enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu. Marathon Grill was a solid weekday dinner option with a tasty, comforting old school burger.",2015-05-13 22:56:40,"{'food': ['Marathon Burger', 'Grilled Salmon'], 'drink': []}"

Like many great things these days, these burgers are accompanied by a hefty pricetag. I got the regular old Village Whiskey burger: Burger on a sesame roll dressed with homemade thousand island, tomato, and Boston Bibb. A girl on the budget has to cut costs somewhere; here, unfortunately, it was the foie gras. 

The toppings can can jack up the price before your wallet even realizes it's empty so, I kept it simple: Smoked bacon and caramelized onions. The burger is the real star here and although the toppings are very tempting, the burger doesn't need it; it is perfect on it's own. Excellent quality beef lovingly grilled on a flat top, perfectly seasoned, and served exactly to your specification. Mine: Medium-rare. If there was ever a burger that could melt in your mouth, this is the one. I felt like a crazed beast, wanting to sink my teeth in again before I was even finished chewing my last bite. Burger bliss.

Pickled vegetables: WOW! Almost as delightful as the burger.

Every time I log into Yelp, there it is sitting in the top 5, eye balling me. I passed by it several times, and though that place looks interesting.

After going, we both should be asking, what is wrong with us. This place Amaze! It looks like a small place with not much to offer. The two main menu items are Lassis and Chaat. I've had a Lassi before, and it's always been Mango. But this place had like 25 Lassi flavors. But what is a Chaat I wondered?

The owner who was working there on our visit explained. There is so much that goes into a Chaat, he lost me somewhere along the way. But what was not lost was my intrigue. I go the Crazy Chicken Chaat. The crazy was their way of saying it's a chicken and beef combo. The beef reminded me of taco meat, but the kind that is seasoned extremely well.

Watching him make the Chaat was like watching an artist. It was like Jackson Pollack at work with the piling on so much stuff. A threw a bunch of stuff down. Then he added 3-4 sauces. He threw more stuff down. Added more sauces. And then he threw more stuff down. Not sure I remember it all, but there was mango, almonds, crispy noodles, dates, potato, and, and, and... yeah that's what I remember. But I know there was more.

Luckily none of the food was bad (the service however was terrible), but really nothing stood out as good enough to justify the markup their charging for the experience. We had tried to go to the Pennsport location first, but they closed just as we arrived (3PM closing time seems odd, no?), so we wound up here, and maybe that location is better or something.

Due to their proximity, we wind up with a lot of Philly natives down in DC, and as a result there's this constant bickering about cities, so when 2 different fried chicken and donut places opened up in DC a few years ago there were of course cries of ""idea theft"" from Federal Donut lovers. Well, I can say with a good bit of certainty, that not being from either town (although I do now reside in DC), both operations in DC (Astro and GBD) are a far superior product than what we had from this Federal Donuts. The creative donuts are more creative, and made better, and the chicken is fried better. Whether or not they ""stole"" the idea of combining 2 of the country's most beloved items is absurd, I'm sure many of us did that in our dorm rooms, but ultimately all that matters is the end product, and Federal Donuts falls short in that regard for me.

As for the donuts, we tried the blackberry walnut, marshmallow squared, and chocolate glazed, along with one of their ""fresh"" made basic donuts, since Suzy isn't really into the fancy flavors. The cake consistency of each of the fancy donuts was well done, but they all just tasted kind of plain. I believe they just use the same cake batter for almost everything and then simply dip it in whatever the flavor is, rather than baking the flavor into the mix. This results in somewhat of a Dunkin Donuts feel to the product, at a much higher premium. The guy doing the fresh donuts was having a good bit of trouble actually making a circle, so Suzy had to keep going back repeatedly to check for her donut (we were literally the only non-employees in the building at the time). Coupled with the fact that he seemed to have a good bit of difficulty answering any questions she had about the menu items, this left us even less impressed with the staff than the actual food.

The fried chicken was somewhat better than the donuts in terms of execution. We chose one dry option and one glazed, and I'm fairly certain I wound up consuming the lion's share of it all (no surprise to anyone who knows my background). The za'atar seasoning was nice and heavy on the chicken, adding lots of flavor, but the chicken itself was a bit too dry. The chili garlic was somewhat excessive, I would prefer to not need an entire roll of paper towels to make through an order of 6 wings. It was hard to get a feel for the chicken itself when you're having to scrape off giant chunks of sauce. It just felt sloppily composed, or just lazily executed. It was nice they include a basic donut with each order, to give you something to balance the flavors, but would have been even nicer if it mentioned that on the menu so that we could have adjusted our donut order accordingly.

I don't recall exactly what our total for a few donuts and a dozen wings (and maybe a soda and a water) was, but it was somewhere between $30-40, which is fairly ridiculous considering the simple approach to everything. If they were huge yeast donuts (like at Doughnut Plant, VooDoo, or GBD) then maybe I could understand, but these donuts lack that level of effort. To top it off their register has one of those annoying ""tip screens"" that you have to go through before signing for your credit card purchase.

the service: the staff are super friendly and inviting and they remember you if you come in frequently. the service is quick and they will bring your stuff to you once it's finished so you don't have to stand around waiting for your food. 

decor: the decor inside is fun and bright, and the walls have a bunch of hot dog related signage from a simpler time in America's culinary history! the tables are confusing at first because of the holes in them...until they bring you your fries and put it in the hole! blew my mind, I thought it was the most genius thing ever!

food: the food is not for the faint of heart. I'm 6' and I can usually pack away food, but I can just barely finish a hot dog and half a regular size fries. the hot dogs are stacked with ingredients, the southern comfort (my personal favorite) comes topped with a bunch of coleslaw and good spicy brown mustard. others, like the Cincinnati skyline (another favorite with beef chili and nacho cheese on top) are even more packed. most will require a fork to get every last morsel. they also do every dog veggie, but I'm a carnivore, so I can't account for that. 

the fries are a really good hearty size. they're hand-cut every morning and fried to order. they were a little tough when they first opened but they must have started cooking them longer cause now they're like mashed potatoes inside. the sea salt they sprinkle them with is also super good and only makes everything better. 

they have a ton of different sauces to put on the fries in addition to plain old ketchup. the peppercorn ranch is great and the pepper tastes freshly ground, the chipotle mayo is super tasty, I hear the curry mayo is great but I don't like curry so give it a try. they usually give you a couple different sauces free of charge so you can get a variety of flavors. 

they're gonna be selling poutine starting in September, and they just had the surf and turf dog that will be added to the permanent menu also in September. 

they will soon be selling t-shirts with the image of your favorite hot dog from the menu, can't wait to get my southern comfort dog shirt!

they also use level-up, a new incentive program based out of Philly and available at several other local bars, restaurants, and stores.

2) Eggs & ham!

3) ""The Board"" literally is a board (the liver mousse was incredible); needed to ask for more bread

One in particular is the choice of ham. In the Philadelphia area I find people predominantly use Dietz and Watson (and sometimes Boar's head). In New York it going to be Thumman's. In fact their meats are somewhat of a cultural phenomenon, much to the way the ""Forman Mill's"" voice is indelibly etched into the soul of every Philadelphian. 

This is the only place to get Thumman's ham. A light, slightly salted ham, that has a pleasant pork taste--and you cannot buy it by the pound. I guess, much in the same way one cannot buy large quantities of Sudafed, Thumman's ham is rationed, in hopes to curb the creation of a more powerful and deadly ham--I jest. Where as other hams are heavier tasting in artificial ""meaty"" flavors or are overloaded with salt, Thumman's ham is literally a ham perfect for everything.

This particular Primo's tends to run out of seedless rolls. And if you order a plain sandwich (something, judging by the cashier's and sandwich maker's reaction, not everyone does) make sure you say no seasoning. Plain only means no condiments or toppings. ""Plain, No Seasoning"" means a dry sandwich with no oregano or salt and pepper. 

I don't eat cold cuts much, but in the entire time I have been coming here the staff has always been friendly, and have only messed up my order twice. The gentleman, who is the manager (or owner), when I phoned him to inform him, offered me a free sandwich next time I come in. I have also seen him chase down a guy who got the wrong order 2 blocks, with the correct order in hand. The manager is surely (no pun intended) a cut above the rest. He runs a fun, yet professional shop. And now they are open Sundays. 

The only reason is why this doesn't get 5 stars, is because the South Street has slightly better ambiance (for a sandwich shop) and has slightly better sandwich presentation (again for a sandwich shop).

The reason I don't give this place five stars is their business model.  My burger was pretty pricey (around 12 dollars), which I wouldn't mind paying for a great product, but, I don't want to pay a tip on top of that.  I just don't understand why they made their restaurants full service.  I didn't expect to walk into a restaurant specializing in burgers and have to be seated, served, and thus pay a tip, which is why I ordered mine to-go.  By the time you get fries, a burger, and pay a tip, you could easily be looking at 20 bucks.

We've passed by 500 Degrees a handful of times on our visits to Philly, and we finally decided that this was the time to go in, as a burger sounded like heaven. 

I was a bit overwhelmed (in a good way) with their choices of specialty burgers and their ""build your own"" menu. I eventually just went with the 500 Burger; seemingly plain compared to others, but you can't go too wrong with lettuce, tomato, cheddar, and bacon, I figured. The beau made his own with Kobe beef, lettuce, and provolone. Both done medium rare and made to order, we reached that heaven we were hoping for.

The French fries were also on point, and we were lucky enough to get ours fresh from the fryer. 

A good choice for a burger and fries, indeed! By my typical NYC standards, they are cheap, too, about $6 - $8 for a good burger. (Man, I'd kill for those prices in NYC sometimes. Ha!)

Ultimate birthday dinner! 

Went here for mine and my husband's birthday on a special trip to Philadelphia.  Whatever expectations I had prior to coming here were easily surpassed during this meal. 

The waitstaff all worked in coordination with one another and everyone was helpful and engaged. 

We started off with a cocktail at the bar.  My husband had the Sbraga punch which was sweet and perfectly balanced.  I enjoyed the South Carolina Serenade which was strong and delicious! 

We were then shown to our table where we found birthday cards for each of us signed by Chef Sbraga and were greeted quickly asking for our water preference and going over the set up of the menu. 

We tried to order quite a few different options to share: 

Truffle Popovers: One of the most delicious bread services I have ever had.  Hot and delicious.  We each had two and probably would have had more, but were glad we didn't so we could enjoy the rest of the food fully. 

First Course
Foie Gras Soup: Perfection.  There are no other words that I can use to describe the serious deliciousness of this dish.  It was rich, hearty and light at the same time, and so silky. I must love my husband because I didn't cut off his hand when he kept reaching in to steal more of my precious soup. 

Pork Belly with chili oil: Delicious and surprisingly light for pork belly.  This was a perfectly balanced dish that would have been a standout anywhere else, but I definitely won the round with the soup.

Second Course

Gnocchi, Escargot, Tom Ka Gai: We both could not pass up on this so we ordered the same dish, and in now way did I feel cheated.  This was the essence of delicious food.  Cloud like gnocchi with delicious and perfectly cooked escargot in an amazing tom ka gai broth with a bit of kick which helped to cut through the richness. 

Third Course

Spring Lamb: Delicious, though I didn't personally appreciate the raw shaved asparagus (personal preference, not a deterrent to the dish).  I enjoyed the dish, but it was not as memorable as the previous courses. 

Wagyu Beef Supplement: Wonderfully unctuous beef cheeks.  Definitely worth the supplement charge and a must try. 

Dessert

With so many interesting choices we asked our waiter for his opinion and he was quick to suggest the banana split and rice pudding. 

They were both delicious and light after such an amazing meal.  We sat for a few minutes savoring all of the interesting flavor combinations and reminiscing on one of the best meals either of us has ever had.  

The services was fantastic and we later found out that the staff had been at the restaurant from 9 am due to the PIFA street fair.  You would never have known that they had been there for more than 12 hours by the end of our meal and still going strong.  Fantastic food and fabulous service!

My friend and I got a booth and for some reason I could not sit comfortably in it. I really liked the atmosphere of the place and it looked like the bar was top notch. We ordered some of their special cocktails and weren't very impressed so we moved to our old standards. 

We started with the duck fat fries appetizer and didn't like them very much and wound up not finishing it. Not seeing much promise due to the appetizer, we decided to just get one burger and see how it went. I ordered the $26 Whiskey King burger, the most expensive burger I ever ordered. The burger was so juicy that when I cut it in half, liquid went all over the plate, which was not a good thing. The bun got soggy and the burger started to fall apart. I had to eat with a knife and fork. Between the two of us we didn't finish one burger, a total waste.

Maybe the place deserves another visit as all the people that recommended it to me told me I ordered the wrong things.

Unless you plan on dining at P&K in the 5:00 hour, it's very crowded and loud, to the point where we have to shout to hear each other across the table. So much for intimate conversation! Another thing we have noticed is that we are treated differently if one (or both) of us orders an alcoholic beverage. We're not big drinkers and when we choose not to have beer or wine with our meal, we shouldn't feel pressured to do so in the hopes that we'll receive better service. A classic example: the last time we were there, our waitress was visibly disappointed that we weren't ordering drinks and told us that the kitchen was backed up about 30 minutes and that it would probably take a while for us to get our food. We waited for a little while, and the waitress came back once or twice to see if we wanted anything from the bar, until my husband finally caved and ordered a beer. Wouldn't you know it - the waitress's attitude changed and our food came out about a minute later. How convenient. Finally, a note about the food. We've been with P&K through a few menu changes now and the latest menu revision is very disappointing. They got rid of our favorite items on the menu - the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and the Parliament burger. The menu offers a roasted pork sandwich, which is supposed to be a spin-off of the kind you'd get at DiNic's in Reading Terminal, but it fails. The only burger choice is now the $18 burger (Churchill, I think?), probably due to the fact that when they had 2 burger choices, I'm sure more people ordered the $14 option. Clever. Speaking of the new pork sandwich and burger, just a heads-up: they will ask you if you want a salad or fries, even though they charge you extra for the fries, a fact that they fail to disclose when you think you actually have an equal choice. I think the bottom line for us is that we don't really have a reason to come back here for a while, between the disappointing menu and the tacit pressure to order alcohol.",2012-11-13 20:33:39,"{'food': ['BBQ pulled pork sandwich', 'Parliament burger'], 'drink': []}"

Countless times over my years of spending lovely afternoons meandering around Philly's Italian Market, I have passed Ralph's and hoped that the next time I was around, I'd be eating there. Ralph's, for all it's history, should be the crowning jewel of Bella Vista with its laid-back neighborhood-restaurant  feel. 
Last week, I stopped in for lunch with a friend from out of town, hoping to start her visit off with a fabulous Italian meal (plus, I had a Groupon!). We decided to split a bunch of appetizers: Antipasto plate, Clams Casino, Bruschetta and Calamari. 
The waiter brought out the Antipasto and Clams Casino first. Both were decent, but nothing special, and obviously not a whole lot of effort put into the presentation. 
Once we were finished with those, the waiter brought out our Calamari and Bruschetta. I expected the Calamari to be breaded and  fried, as is usual in the many Italian restaurants in which I've eaten. My mistake, I guess, but if the calamari, which I assume was just cooked in the sub-par tomato sauce, tasted even slightly fresh or flavorful, I may have been able to enjoy it. It's not often that I don't eat anything put in front of me, but this was one of those times. The calamari was soggy and fishy. To me, it tasted like someone dumped a can of calamari in a pot of canned tomato sauce. 
I am of the opinion that there is almost nothing you can do to ruin Bruschetta... unless you use tomatoes OUT OF A CAN! Seriously, Ralph's? How hard is it to buy and chop fresh tomatoes for Bruschetta when you are located IN the Italian market? 
Redeeming qualities? Ralph's is cute. The inside reminds me of what my Italian grandma's Italian Restaurant would have looked like. The waiter we had, though unfortunately I don't remember his name,  was really nice and attentive, and made a great dessert suggestion for us.

Our server recommended the pizzas, so we decide to split a couple of those plus some appetizers.

We started off with two kinds of mussels - the red and the white. The red one was delicious, with a slightly spicy broth. The white one had a thinner and less flavorful broth and wasn't nearly as good. Our next appetizer was the calamari, which was also pretty good.

The pizzas on the menu are split into two types: red and white. Our table decided to try four (two reds, two whites):
- Spiced apple and goat cheese (white) - I was really reluctant to try this one because I don't like goat cheese, but it was surprisingly good. The goat cheese taste wasn't very strong, but I didn't taste much apple either.
- Italian market (red) - my favorite pizza of the night. The toppings were a good mix of sausage and basil.
- Truffle (white) - wasn't a huge fan, mainly because the cheese tasted too much like goat cheese. There could've also been more mushrooms.
- Three little pigs (red) - also wasn't a huge fan. There was a bit too much meat.

The pizzas are advertised as thin crust pizza, but the crust was nowhere near as thin as I expected. On a spectrum of pizza crust thickness, they would be somewhere in the middle but closer to the thick crust end. They were yummy, though.

The restaurant wasn't very crowded for a Saturday night, so our food came out pretty quick and the service was also excellent. Our server, Kyle, was super friendly and hilarious, and played along with us when we started taking bets on what items would be on the dessert menu (shocker of the night: the only dessert offered was strawberry tiramisu). Overall, I'd recommend Barra for their pizza.",2013-02-25 23:14:50,"{'food': ['pizzas', 'mussels', 'calamari'], 'drink': []}"

We went on Saturday night. The place was not very crowded but a good crowd with a large party upstairs. 

We arrived at 8:15 and stood at the door, hostess area, for about 10 solid minutes before anyone came over. Lots of staff walking back and forth and no one even looking in our location. One or two had to pass us to go outside with even making eye contact. 

We finally sat and then the real waiting started. First for menus, then for the orders to be taken, then for our bread and drinks. But the ultimate wait was for our food. I'd say a solid 40 mins for the apps to come out and another 30-40 for our meal. The waitress did tell us the problem was in the kitchen. (You could see in the kitchen, lots of talking and standing around). 

Nearly every table around us had the same issues. The table next to us got their dinner but not their apps, which cause even more confusion. I'll be surprised if you don't get a lot of these today. 

Then out comes our dinner. The food was hands down the worst Italian meal I have had in So. Philly and I lived here my entire life and eat out a lot. The pasta as so over cooked that it was falling apart and I picked it up. My wife and daughter had the same issues. Theirs looked more like pasta soup.

I was at a loss as to what to try for the first time and although the portobello wrap looked tempting, the cashier recommended the curry wrap. I also added avocado and buffalo sauce.

I was intrigued by the concept of a place that specializes in DONUTS and CHICKEN....not really two items you generally would put together, but certainly two of many peoples, myself included, favorites!  

This place ended up offering the exact opposite in my opinion; GREAT chicken, and GOOD donuts.  We got a half order of the Buttermilk Ranch seasoned ""twice fried korean style"" chicken, and I swear...I'm not like a chicken connoisseur or anything, and I haven't traveled the world 'round looking for the best chicken, but in my 30 years of life on this planet, it was the BEST I've ever tasted.  Perfect crispiness on the outside, just the right amount of seasoning without being too much, and the actual chicken itself was nice and hot, and flavorful.  Incredible!!

The donuts we got were a Sticky Bun, Chocolate Sea Salt and Cookies & Cream.  My fav was the Cookies & Cream, the Sea Salt was damn good, and the Sticky Bun was really good too.  These are the ""Fancy Donuts"" and you better just HOPE they have them left, you gotta get there at the right time (I forget the time exactly, but read other reviews to get a sense), otherwise you're SOL and are stuck with whatever they got left.  The donuts were really good, soft enough and a good texture.  MUCH better than places like Dunkin Donuts (though i'm fond of them...) but not quite as good as a place like Duck Donuts (if you've ever made it to the FAMOUS OBX spots, you're missing out on life).

Service was very friendly despite being very busy, which as much as I love philly, i'm unaccustomed to (ever been to Pats/Genos? YEA - opposite of this), and it was a very pleasant surprise to have very nice people behind the counter.

Parking was easy enough, there's about 6-8 spots right out front in a little ""lot"" and street/curb parking.  Despite a picture somewhere else from someone, it is NOT ""sketch"" at all.

Okay, no, not literally. But I should let you know that I was the one who once told all of her friends, ""You will NEVER get me to like raw fish. Never."" So when I received the invitation to eat at Numa, I was fully prepared to plaster a fake smile on my face while forcibly moving my mandibles in a grand show of mastication. By the time i left, I was hooked. 

When walking in, I was greeted with a modern yet welcoming decor, and it made me wish I'd seen the place before the huge renovations. From what I hear, the place has undergone an incredible visual turnaround. The waitresses were lovely and helpful without being swarming or smarmy. Even during the lunch rush, there was none of the harried feeling that sometimes accompanies service when the room becomes filled with hungry customers. 

And on to the most important part - the food. The raw fish was outstanding. I never expected to use that combination of words from the English language, especially about a place that's on the smaller end of the grand scale of sushi eateries, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the owners have invested in truly high grade sushi. For me, that just translates to - ""Om nom nom, is there more, nom nom?"" The salmon melted away into clouds in my mouth, leaving none of the fishy aftertaste that lingers after eating not-so-fresh fish. The toro, which I had for the first time, was torched briefly before being set down on my rice, and it was no less beautiful. We also tried a few of the signature rolls, each seeming to emerge fresher and more beautifully prepared than the last. The vegetables were crisp, the tempura in the cooked pieces were lovely, and the accompanying sauces were perfect, never overpowering and tipping the balance of flavors too much in one direction. The miso soup was standard fare, but arrived nice and hot and rounded out my meal. To top things off, the owners, who were on site during our meal, were a lovely couple and warm and charming to boot. 

We had some young children in our group, whose limited vocabulary precluded them from full participation in this review, but I heard no complaints from them as they ate heartily from their salmon teriyaki bento box. In fact, their chopsticks seemed to travel more often to our plates than their own, and I can think of no higher compliment to any eatery than when kids are happily shkoffing their food. 

Can I say I love sushi now? Will I eat it more often now? I'm a little sorry to say - absolutely not. Because once you have it so great in one place, it sets you up for disappointment when you taste subpar fish elsewhere. 

But even this normally non-sushi lover can wholeheartedly recommend Numa.",2011-07-01 16:20:53,"{'food': ['salmon', 'toro'], 'drink': []}"

All of the sushi selections were very delicious.  Getting to the kobe beef dish.  I did order it well, I don't like pink meat.  The chef asked if he could make a suggestion saying that this cut of beef doesn't fare well when cooked in this manner, but assured us if that was what I wanted he would do it.  I decided to throw caution to the wind and told him to cook it the way he thinks it should be done.  I don't think I have ever had a better tasting piece of beef.  It was a while ago, so I don't quite remember what the desserts were, but they were extremely yummy.  We had no leftovers of anything!  I'd like to go back to the service we received.

The restaurant has an authentic 1950's feel (I imagine), probably partly because it has been around since the late 40's.  

Chinks has a very small menu, offering cheesesteaks, burgers and sausages, and drinks including milkshakes, egg creams and chocolate and vanilla sodas. Ice cream is also available.  The staff is almost entirely cute, friendly 20 year old girls.  

The cheesesteak I had was very good, although I don't find cheesesteaks from different shops all that different from one another. The biggest difference here is that the meat is sliced rather than chopped.

I had been craving burgers for a good solid week before I actually ended up going here. The place definitely isn't made to handle high-volume traffic and that is reflected in the venue and the speed of service. There also aren't enough sauce bottles to ensure a more uniform distribution through the restaurant. You'll have to steal your favorite sauce from other customers. People also like to mix and match the chairs (the tables and the counts have different heights, but customers don't seem to put the chairs back). A slight annoyance when you're trying to bite into your burger and you can barely get your elbows on to the counter.

The burger itself was tasty. The patty is juicy and really well cooked. There is a nice char on there that you won't get from other burger joints in this price range. The bread is also a notch above other fast food burgers. However, the overall package left something more to be desired. Though everything was well handled and the ingredients are good, there really wasn't enough flavor to make it truly great. It really felt like something was missing, and for the price, I would rather go somewhere else. The portion is intermediate. It won't get you terribly full nor will it leave you starving.

The fries are interesting, I'll give it that. They are the shoestring variety. The ""spicy"" fries are basically cajun fries, though I think Five Guys does a better job on that front. The truffle fries aren't really truffled, but they probably have the best flavor of the bunch. I did not get to try the sweet potato fries, but if I ever come back, I'll grab an order of those.

One really great thing about 500 Degrees is that they have a really awesome fountain soda collection. They look like local or microbrew sodas. All in all, if you have a burger fix, this place will cure it. Don't expect anything spectacular, but if you're tired of other fast food burgers, this is a nice change of pace.

The Smiths ate breakfast at Honey's today and were disappointed.  

If you are going to cook mexican/southwestern food, you should do it right.  

The Huevos Rancheros had no red  sauce on them.  I have never had this dish without red sauce or a choice of red or green.  As a result, this was not a spicy dish as it should be and as it was described on the menu.

The Enfrijoladas were served luke warm at best.  They had good flavor but also were not spicy as advertised.

We ordered a side of chorizo and it came to us as a pile of little slices that were so overcooked that the flavor was virtually gone.

If you want great heuvos rancheros done right, try Michael's Kitchen in Taos, NM.

The latke and the fresh orange juice were good but charging extra for sour cream is a bit much

This less than satisfactory breakfast cost $39+tip.  Way too much for what we got.

The ricotta  ""schmear"" smothered the toasted bagette slice so much that the bread tasted soggy and stale. It was way too much. I sampled my friend's potato pizza and it was so disappointing. I highly anticpated this since I love potatoes so much but the truffle oil overpowered instead of highlighting the dish.

My friend's brussel spouts smelled like feet- this made my experience even more miserable. I really thought someone took off their shoes ( I know , I know, they're supposed to smell like that- they could have toned them down somehow though!)

Went here for a romantic date on a Friday night. Brought a bottle of wine-- BYOB is a great feature. The whole place was pretty loud, crowded and fast paced with servers running around at all times. If only the conversations were spoken in a Italian, these aspects would make it a very authentic Italian experience, so overall I cannot complain about the noise. Being to Italy a couple times, the decor and the atmosphere were pretty good. But then there's the service...

Most of it was good. We had a foreign server who I don't believe was Italian but that doesn't matter. She was good at her job. There were also invisible hand refilling our water, olive oil, and bread throughout the meal. Which reflect a very important point: good service it that which you don'tnotice. There was one server, however, who must have skipped that class in serving school, because she would try to make cheesy jokes every time she came to the table. This, to me, is not appropriate for the kind of restaurant this one seems to be going for.

The food was not special at all. For the carbonara, I could have made a sauce that tasted better (I'm half italian but by no means a chef), and the ravioli dish was too small and generally unimpressive. 

I lked the unlimited bread though. Ate lots of that. Probably the best part of the meal, looking back :P

I like their rolls from Liscio's, they carry above average meats and I've never been unhappy with any of their many franchised locations - until now. Primo Hoagies are not the best hoagies in our hoagie filled land, but they are always much better than the below average hoagies you get at just about any pizza & steak shop.

With this said, stay away from this location until they get new management or ownership. Their body language is unhappy and miserable before they even ask to take you order - once the employees speak and interact with you, their miserableness becomes confirmed. So that's problem number one.

Problem number two: The Turkey hoagie I ordered sucked. There were only 2 tiny, thin half slices of tomato on the hoagie! So lame! I know the cost of produce is higher than it used to be, but this was ridiculous - felt totally ripped off. There was very little onion and lettuce as well. I asked for oil and vinegar on the hoagie and it wasn't there - it was dry!!  Additionally I ordered roasted long hot peppers, which I believe they charge extra for, however, there was only one small one - but it was decent.

I can't imagine how someone who puts down 150K to 200K to open a Primo unit could operate it so poorly and expect to be successful.

When we walked in last night, we were seated at one of the high tops by the window, which was great for people watching in Chinatown. I liked that especially since I'm never in Chinatown. Plus, the rest of the restaurant looked a little crowded.

Penang certainly has an interesting menu -- that's for sure. Now, being that I'm me, I instantly searched the menu for the cheapest and blandest looking options. I asked our server if I should order the spare ribs with noodle soup or boneless chicken with scallion rice. He suggested the chicken, and it was a good pick. Good flavor, heaping portion of white rice on the side. Cheap. Overall, not a bad meal.

I wouldn't recommend the Tiger Beer. It's comparable to very-cheap domestics and almost $5.

Now, we were headed to a show after dinner, so once we were done eating, I nicely asked for our check. And then waited, and waited, and waited. And of course, when you're on your way somewhere and waiting, a minute feels like five. So it felt like I was waiting for a very long time. He popped over at one point to let us know that he didn't have our check yet because he got busy, but then he NEVER resurfaced again.

Eventually, I flagged down another server and requested the check be delivered right then. He brought it out -- not separate like we had asked, but we figured it out. We never saw our server again before cutting out (thank goodness we had exact change), and that was pretty annoying to me.

My plan was to get the hummus and pita. I love that. My party ended up skipping appetizers and just going straight to the entrees. 

I got the tilapia +spinach+rich. The other got the chicken and waffles (I yet to try that combo anywhere) and the meatloaf.

The tilapia was encrusted with pistachio crumbs. I enjoyed it but towards the end, something about it became  nauseating.

Fried green tomato TLT? I'm there! This restaurant has plenty for the veggie crowd, and it is indeed tasty. 

I've been a few times; so far, my favorite menu item is the fries. They're a perfect shoestring example, and the portion is generous. And for every other cliche this restaurant embodies, at least they give you good ol' Heinz ketchup for dipping. 

I'll mention the other things I've tried, from best to worst. Best: the veggie bacon burger. This veggie patty is homemade and flavorful. It's thick and doesn't squish to nothing when you eat it (veggie burger connoisseurs will know precisely what this means). It's topped with plenty of tempeh bacon and an interesting tomato jam that's a nice sweet complement. 

Next: the fried green tomato TLT. This is a very brown sandwich, between the breaded tomato, the tempeh, and thick slices of brown bread. Each piece is good, although as a Southern girl I'd have to rate the fried green tomato a B-. It's too thin and there's too much breading; a good fried green tomato is lightly crusted with cornmeal, and thick enough for you to actually taste the tomato. The tomato on this sandwich gets lost among the tempeh strips. The saving grace on this sandwich is the Tabasco mayo -- yum!

Finally: the buttermilk fried seitan sandwich. This was the most promising menu item, and like many high-risk things, the promise of a big reward was met with big disappointment. The seitan was beautifully battered and fried, emulating your favorite Chick-Fil-A, but, sadly, it was excruciatingly bland. 

One time when I'm ready to bypass the heavy sandwiches and fries, I'll try one of their interesting looking salads, which my dining partners have enjoyed.

What can I say? I was in the mood for some really jank Chinese food.

WHAT I GOT: Chicken fried rice and crab rangoon

PROS: Well, I'm gonna be honest and say that the best part about this was the price. Both items added together was only $12ish and that was including tax and tip. The crab rangoon was like $4 for 10 of them and your average sized, typical Chinese takeout container was filled all the way to the top with the fried rice. The taste actually wasn't terrible either. Basically what you would expect from Americanized Chinese food.

CONS: You get what you paid for I guess. The skin to the crab rangoons were less than crispy. They were kind of on the flaccid side. Not much filling to them either but it was ok. I'm also kinda scared that the chicken in the fried rice wasn't cooked all the way so I might feel the pain later.",2017-05-18 00:33:03,"{'food': ['Chicken fried rice', 'Crab rangoon'], 'drink': []}"

From now on, I will question anyone who says ""Blah blah blah has my favorite burger..."" with ""Have you been to Village Whiskey?"" Because it's really that good. It's an all around phenomenal burger.

Dan and I had lunch here last week. It was a beautiful day, and Village Whiskey has some great outdoor seating.  They run tables along the wall like most places, but they have a bit more room than normal and an awning to provide shade.  We didn't step inside, but I'm sure it has a nice atmosphere.  The service during our whole meal was good; I'd be surprised to find anything less at a place like this.  

True to its name, this spot has an incredible selection of whiskey.  We didn't partake, but I'd like to at some point.  The beer list is decent, even though everything is one or two more dollars than it should be.  There are about six draft beers that rotate, along with a decent bottle list, including about ten large format bottles.  We split a 25oz bottle of red and white for $25, which isn't bad at all.  This Dogfish Head beer is a a whit aged in pinot noir barrels.  I really love it.

We both went with the burger.  There's an option to get a $24 burger with blue cheese, bacon and foie gras on top.  It sounds like overkill to me.  I went with the regular burger with blue cheese.  When it came out, I didn't like the looks of the burger.  Large chunks of blue cheese topped a patty that looked larger than a hockey puck.  I thought this huge patty was ridiculously oversized.  It only took one bite to change my mind.  To start, the burger was more tender and juicy than any other I've had.  Second, the ground beef was so lightly packed that it was almost barely formed.  This gave the meat great texture, and was why the patty seemed so large.  The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The blue cheese was a fantastic addition; it's quickly becoming my favorite cheese for burgers. 

The burgers don't come with any sides, so we put in an order of fries.  We decided to splurge and order the duck fat fries topped with Sly Fox cheddar sauce and braised short ribs.  It's a bit of overkill.  It's also delicious.  Every part of this side dish is well executed.  If you can forget that it's well over 1000 calories, you'll be able to enjoy these beefy cheddar fries.  To be honest, I think I'll order the plain fries next time.

Bottom Line: The burger here is amazing, and it's reason enough to visit.  It's a bit pricey, but that's what you should expect for the area.  If you eat meat, I highly recommend coming here.  A little more effort in the beer list is desired, but other than that Village Whiskey doesn't disappoint.

The Loews exceeded our expectations! I cannot believe they have ratings below 5 star. From the moment we checked in to the moment we picked up our luggage from
Concierge we were treated with the utmost respect. There was constant professionalism and of course the staff was very friendly and kind! 

A gentleman at The concierges desk gave us a printed out sheet (upon request) of the top 10 attractions in Philly along with with description, address, and directions from the hotel. All within walking distance. PS you are right by the Reading Terminal Market, which is great for lunch! I would recommend Carmens Philly cheesesteaks! So amazing. Anyways.... 

We were on the 8th floor in a luxury room and the view was gorgeous! We were looking right out into the city. Our room was very spacious and had plenty of storage for clothes and shoes. Room has an iron and two bathrobes, as well as a hair dryer. Of course body washes are there waiting. The shower was great! Not tiny and had different levels of pressure from the shower head. Bathroom was also nice and spacious. 

The room wasn't over the top luxurious. It was just right. It was very spacious and comfortable. Bed was cozy and comfy beyond belief. Usually after hotel stays I can't wait to get to my bed. No way. I didn't want to leave the Loews. 

From morning till early evening there are free and fresh refreshments in the lobby. That was always a nice treat after a full day of adventures. The hotel also smells soooo good and fresh. I know that's an odd factor to put in here but if you've ever walked into a hotel and smelled something not so fresh, or even cleaning products you appreciate the Loews scent! Enjoy it. 

There is a fun restaurant/bar right in the entrance of the hotel. We didn't eat there but looked fun! PS hotel is puppy friendly! We saw so many awesome dogs. 

Check out was at 12 and we were rushed by no one to be out immediately (keep in mind it was a sold out week due to the holidays). That was a nice touch. No one likes phone call after phone call reminding you to leave. 
As I briefly mentioned concierge is very helpful! We still had a full day to kill after checkout. Without a doubt they held our luggage for hours, no charge. 

The staff is really amazing. Always willing to help and lend a helping hand. Always smiling and was there to give recommendations on where to go and what to see.

My boyfriend and I once spent the entire meal quizzing the bartender on what drinks he was making and well, if he was annoyed, he never showed it. 

As fun as it is to sit at the bar, I usually don't get a drink there because of the price. My boyfriend loves to try all sorts of beers, but not being a beer drinker myself, I can only assume that the selection is quality. I will say that they let him do a taste test of any new beer before he orders a whole one. 

The food for the most part is a big hit. We always order the pickled beets with toasted bread, olive tapenade, and ricotta with fruity olive oil. The beets are tangy and a little sweet. When you get tired of eating pickles, the ricotta and olive tapenade help neutralize your palette so you can go back in for more. It's true that they usually skimp on the bread, but that's a quick fix- we just ask for more. 

Now for the mains. I usually get the veggie burger with avocado not because I don't like a good burger, but because we usually eat there when it's too late for me to go home and go to bed on a full stomach. The veggie burger itself has a great flavor and while I appreciate that it's not loaded with breadcrumb filler, it could use a little more structure. After getting it about 4 times now, I've just about mastered the veggie burger hold so that I squeeze the bun just enough to hold it all in place but don't over-squeeze so that the beany burger spills out onto the plate. It comes with a nice bright slaw that gives it some crunchy texture. My boyfriend either gets the Village burger or the BBQ Sammy . Both are really good and juicy. The fried pickles are theoretically a nice touch with the BBQ Sammy, but they honestly don't add much flavor-wise. The burger is definitely heftier, and pickled beets, burgers, and splitting a round of the duck fat fries with cheese, you just want to roll home. The only big improvement that the restaurant could make is serving slightly sturdier buns. They are a little too soft and pillowy for the juicy ingredients that they usually have inside.

I'm not one for lambasting establishments, but I'm writing this review because I hope someone reads this and helps their staff understand a restaurant is ALL about the experience. 

 To be honest, I would say if you're looking for happy hr, this place might be for you. But if you're looking for service and a personal touch, go somewhere else.

highlights (errr lowlights?) of the evening: We're eating with a number of veteran hospitality professionals, so they're not out to bust balls or be difficult..  A friend asks ""any specials, what do you recommend""...the hipster dude rolls his eyes and says ""no"".... that's it, just ""no"". ""So what do you recommend?"" ""It's all pretty good""... thanks for the advice! 

Then we waited 25min with empty drinks on the table.  

Food arrives, no silverware or napkins. Ask the waiter, Waited over 5 min for him to return as our food cooled...nothing, I go inside  to salvage utensils from other tables... finally someone else notices and follows me to the table, puts down a stack of napkins , has a handful of forks and knives, asks who needs them but walks away before everyone has a setting. He literally walked away from the table!

One of the guests ordered coffee 3 times.

there was a nail in the bench we were sitting on and it ripped a friends rather expenisve pants... no prob, mistakes happen, he asked for a hammer to nail it back in but no one really seemed to care. Finally the manager asked what he could do... If you're reading this managers, offer what you can do. Don't expect a guest to be a prick and  develop a plan! Anything would have made us happy at this point, 10% off the bill, round of drinks, desert, ANYTHING just make us believe you care about your job, the restaurant, our experience... anything.... he just kinda stood there blankly shurgging his solders. 

Hopefully these guys will get their act together, replace the hipster nonchalance with a few people who know how to create a good eating experience.

da8jnTAhv3byZ1wtxq-AQw,rJZuQtzwH4S_XTMgh0ZG3w,JUlsvVAvZvGHWFfkKm0nlg,4,3,1,3,"El Camino Real, known as The King's Highway, was a 600 Mile stretch of road in California connecting 21 Spanish held missions from 1683 to 1834 connecting San Diego to San Francisco.  Northern Liberties is now home to it's very own El Camino Real offering two menus of either Mexican or Barbeque fare.  In the resting place of the former Deuce in Liberties Walk, owner Owen Kamihira (also of Bar Ferdinand next door) has taken a swing at the ever growing mexican genre in the eastern most section between Spring Garden and Girard.  With SO many places in 10 square blocks to get nachos and burritos, can the king's highway possibly bring anything worthy to the table?  Can I at least get a decent margarita?!  Please?

Upon entering El Camino, I notice that the kitchen has been opened up and the bar swings all around - similar to Johnny Brenda's.  The chairs have a mission-made look to them, the lights aren't too dark and the decor is far from overdone.  It's like, a restaurant!  The three flat screen tvs behind the bar are welcoming for those who want to keep up on the game.  For those trying to get away from the game, there's a large seating section in the back away from the bar and potential rowdiness of the inevitable Philly Phan.  

With so many mexican't offerings in the neighborhood, I focused completely on the barbeque.  You have your apps, ala carte, entrees and sandwiches and some sides to boot.  It turned out that because the place has been so busy in it's opening week they were out of a few items that I would have loved to give a try.  The menu includes pork ribs, beef ribs, short ribs, brisket, burger, shaved pork, links, and one seitan offering.   I went with brisket and shaved pork and a side of potato salad.  

To accompany my barbeque, I ordered an El Camino Margarita.  Folks, BEST margarita I've had in a long time!  It's five bucks and I really can't urge you enough to try one for yourself.  

The food arrives and I take a bite of my shaved pork.  I think it might be a pork loin, it's nothing like ham.  Much firmer and barbeque-y.  Very tasty and even better with the side of BBQ sauce.  The potato salad was splendid.  Some of the best I've had.  Rustic and creamy with red skin and chives and onions.  I've saved the best for last though.  I'm not sure if The King's Highway has a signature dish but I'm going to write a petition to have Great Northern Liberties Brisket Day.  My guess is a little more than a half pound of the slowest cooked beef ever to set foot this side of the Schuylkill.  Want to get your vegetarian friends to eat beef?  This is the deal my friend!  The only thing that could have made this MOUTH-GASM any better would be if there was six more pounds of it.  One of my dinning partners exclaimed that this beats ANY philly cheese steak ANY day.  Mr. Chef, I bow in your greatness.  

Obviously, no dessert would have been any better than the meal we just had but we had a shot at some banana pudding anyway, just to see if this place is still taking us seriously.  Sure enough, they've even managed to make the best pudding ever!  

I just need to go back here as often as possible and try everything on the menu.  Next time will be the mexican for sure.  I doubt anything is going to beat the oral-brisket-gasm but... what if I'm wrong?!?!  The drinks alone are going to be a good reason that you're going to find me there at least once a week.  Plus, I live around the corner so that helps too!  See you there!

I'll close with noting that El Camino has not been open very long.  They're still working out the kinks here and there so if you can be patient, I guarantee you'll be well rewarded.",2008-12-29 02:40:13,"{'food': ['brisket', 'shaved pork'], 'drink': ['El Camino Margarita']}"

They are now only offering the fixed price menu, so my thoughts on specific plates are largely irrelevant. We did try many of the dishes Vetri is known for, including the sweet onion crepe, spinach gnocchi, and roasted capretto (baby goat!) - that was actually my goal in squeezing in a meal before they made the menu switch, since I wanted to make sure I was able to try all of these in one go. The food definitely met my expectations, especially the pasta (which is available in half-portions - we shared 3 half-portions among four of us as a first course, which gave everyone a taste of many of the pastas but left us with plenty of room for the larger entrees). My favorite was the sweet onion crepe, the table's favorite was the spinach gnocchi. I was underwhelmed by dessert but I made the mistake of ordering something without the word 'chocolate' in the description so I deserved it. 

Service was good but not overly impressive, and the restaurant feels a little crowded - the ambiance is not what I'd expect from a restaurant with this kind of price tag. When I go out, I'm there to eat - but I also appreciate the experience of dining out. I didn't feel the atmosphere at Vetri quite lived up to the quality of the food. That being said, I'm looking forward to heading back to try the Degustazione - word on the street is that's how Vetri should be experienced.",2011-03-27 02:04:25,"{'food': ['sweet onion crepe', 'spinach gnocchi', 'roasted capretto (baby goat!)'], 'drink': []}"

2hVRpz_01kX69Ijmt4GkpQ,I0ezkVvCcBnavJf2soWHjA,_tADqh3OmH6CzGJWKkru3g,4,4,4,3,"I'm legitimately excited about some Latin Flavor coming to my neighborhood. Ever since Novemeber when these nice people opened up a beacon of deliciousness up the street, I feel finally as though my world of comfort food in proximity is more complete.

Growing up in the Bronx, surrounded by killa Puetro Rican and Dominican cookin, a redheaded stepchild develops mad hankerings that really take hold. For instance, mine is a life-long love of every incarnation of plantain. I mean, crispy tostones, or soft cartelized maduros, mofongo- they're just the epitome of comfort food for me, however you wanna prepare em, gimmmeee. 

I repeat, there is some good Latin home cookin happening at between 6th & 7th on South. You're covered whether you want a lil snacky, or, light-to-no-coma-more-of-a-heavy-nap inducer of a platter. Whadda joy to stop real in real quick, to this cafeteria style restaurant, for empanadas, or a Cuban sandwich, or those rellenos de papa! More of those potato balls later. You babies get your own paragraph.

We skew porky pernil (so juicy, fatty, and crispy skinned- every kinda porky way) when it comes to platters but have also developed a real habit with the tasty beef stew, too. These meats and many more, served platter-style, come with choice of type of rice and beans, a little salad, and then some so delicious maduros. So good. Sweet plantains: creamy sweetness between salty bites. I wax poetic about plantains. That's what happens.

I'm such a fan of sides, though. That's where the ole gal gets herself into a real, ""Carb it up, carb face,"" situation, I'll call it. I could do me up a plate just like that. Like, all sides all day. If there was ever to be a national day dedicated to starchy carb feasts, I'd like to spend such a holiday here at Latin Flavor, cause all my favorites they gots.

Latin Flavor's yellow rice and peas- arroz con gandules-  that's the move. We order extra sides of black beans, because they are perfect. Yuca frita is really crispy-fluffy and just what you want. If I mention plantains one more time your eyeballs will scream, but you know? 

And then there are the potato balls. The rellenos de papa. Do you want a crispy softball sized orb of seasoned mashed potatoes with a beefy center? You should. Cause they're dope. They're also the best that I've had in YEARS. Super flavorful. As other wise reviewers have noted- get em with gravy. Doooo it. 

Now here's the one thing, certainly you can scurry on home with generous portions of Latin platters, stuffed into take-out tins, but I say to you, eat your rellenos de papas at the restaurant for optimum excellence. Of course they'll still be good to-go, but take some time outta your life to enjoy the crispy, crispy, crispy outter shell in contrast to the mash and gravy. That's peak potato ball time.

Right, so I command you: You sit there and eat your potato balls.

Alright, you see what's happening here. I'm loving this spot for lunch and dinner and snacks and everything. Long live Latin Flavor.",2015-03-09 04:59:58,

There's a reason why the menu goes out of its way to note that it's made from meat provided by NYC's LaFrieda Meats.  Any time anybody mentions that they are cooking with LaFrieda Meats, it should be reason enough to order whatever it is (unless you live next to a Shake Shack in NYC, and need to avoid getting a heart attack from daily burger consumption or something).  Got it medium rare, it came out coked to the perfect point of warm, juicy, pink, and ohsoflavorful.  Mr. R and I stopped talking, both focused on the experience of the Churchill burger.  At $18 it's not cheap, but in the case of the Churchill burger, you do get what you pay for,  and it's one hell of a burger made from excellent quality meat.  

We had it with a side dish of brussel sprouts, which were good but not crispy enough on the outside and a little mush on the inside.  Nonetheless, there was not a single bit left in the bowl at the end.  The fries that came with it were crispy and dark, but over salted.  Sadly, I left 4 or 5 fries on the plate when my glass of water ran out and I just couldn't finish the fries.  I never leave fries behind.   Minus one star.

We were there Thurs night around 9pm and were seated right away, but half way through dinner the music got louder as the bar got a little more crowded, and when Mr. R and I were ready to acknowledge each other again (now that our burgers was completely consumed), we couldn't carry on any conversation.   I've never been one to favor the bustling social bar scene though, so others may recommend going later when it's more ""lively"" - as for me, and those who like the slower paced laid-back pub feel, I'd say go earlier in the night. Minus another star.

Our server was fine, waters refilled, food arriving fairly fast - but at the end we couldn't find a single staff member to flag down for our check (nobody even walked by and it's a tiny establishment) for a little while, they might have been a tad short staffed, or we came as they were going from ""kitchen"" mode to ""pub"" mode or something...?

Things went smoothly but slowly, however, after 18, I still had plenty of time to make the reception of the wedding ceremony I had missed around hole 15 (don't frown at me, I was a friend's fourth string plus one). All was still well as the twelve of us began loading up the car caravan, when suddenly we heard a low rumbling.

No. Best meal I've ever had in Philadelphia? No. Best meal I've ever had in the 19107 zip code? Sorry, no again. Am I a bit disappointed after reading all the accolades and reading Vetri's interviews, etc.? Yes. Am I glad I went? I think so. But would I return, no.

Anyone who knows me knows I'm a bit of a foodie. Vetri's been on my ""must try"" list for years. And with the spate of closing that've recently hit some Philadelphia favorites, I wanted to make sure I got to experience it...just in case.

The service was great: polite, smiling, complimentary prosecco upon arrival, etc. I was also super-impressed with the de-crumbing skills.

The decor was lovely: simply ornate chandelier; large floor-to-ceiling mirror between the windows on Spruce Street; hand-blown, heavy water glasses; an impressive espresso machine on display on the sideboard; and incredibly delicate (wish I owned them all) wine, spirits, and beer glasses.

The food...overall, every dish that was not meant to be sweet was on-the-edge-of too salty (a few aspects tipped over into simply-too-salty, e.g., the potatoes under the goat). What the kitchen got very right: the bread (e.g., the grain bread that came out first was awesome--I would stock my house with that bread, with the grains adding interest and texture without being dry), the Tuna Crudo (loved the celery leaves, crisp Granny Smith apple slices, and parsnip, though my fellow diner thought the mixture overpowered the fragile flavor of the tuna); the Spinach Gnocchi with Brown Butter (pillow-like gnocchi rivaling those found at Ristorante La Buca); the Almond Tortellini with Truffle Sauce (fantastic texture and a sop-every-last-drop-with-your-bread sauce!); the pre-dessert sweet cream gelato with fruit and lemon poppy-seed cake (tasted like a whipped-cream gelato with zesty, slightly sour fruit and a perfectly cooked cake); and the Chocolate Polenta Souffle (perfectly executed).

As I stated initially, it was a good meal. However, there are other restaurants with as good service, better food (where every dish makes you sigh with happiness and start thinking about who you can convince to go out to dinner with you so you can go back again), and a lower price tag.

I'll start with the service.  We were seated at 5:15 because we had theater tickets for later in the evening and wanted to be sure we had plenty of time.  That didn't matter because we were rushed in and out so quickly, we ended up having to waste a fair amount of time with ciders at the PHS Pop-Up Garden across the street.  When we were seated the restaurant was mostly empty, with one couple on the window seat and another at the other end of two tops.  The hostess tried seating us right next to the other couple at the end, who had clearly just been seated.  This instantly made me feel uncomfortable, so I asked if we might move down one.  The hostess stared at me for a few beats with a look that said she might want to kill me.  But then she chirped, ""sure, of course!"" and sat us one table over. It was weird.

I had been really pumped on Yelp reviews, so I had a plan for our meal selections.  The server seemed taken aback by my speedy order, and maybe they assumed that since I ordered quickly, we wanted to be fed in an extremely fast, assembly-line style.

I ordered the drink pairing, which was, for my selections, one white wine, one rose, one merlot and a Mudslide.  It was not that impressive, and I would just order your own favorite beverages.

So, for the food.  Foie gras soup was amazing, even if you are ""meh"" about foie gras.  Definite must try!  The pork belly was very spicy, but delicious.  Octopus was very good, salmon not so much.  It was very rare and served with an Indian style sauce and some hard chickpeas.  I wished I had ordered the octopus.  (Which the server warned SO much about how spicy the sauce was, my husband ordered it on the side.  He then ended up using the entire sauce, it must not have been that outrageously spicy?)  The main entrees are where things got really disappointing.  I had the brisket, which was like eating a tiny, fatty square of St. Patty's day corned beef and cabbage.  My husband had the pork, which was another tiny square, but was served with a delicious square of cheese bread pudding that he liked.

After the underwhelming entrees, desserts were better.  The dirt pudding was fun and delicious and the cheese plate selections (two) were good, but could've used some more glamorous accompaniments (I just remember 4 green grapes.  There was something else, but I don't remember it).  The Mudslide was the best part of dessert.

This place is acceptable, and while my husband enjoyed not being stuffed before a show, I felt the portions were way too small for the price.  At about $100 per person after drinks and tip, we were rushed through every course and didn't enjoy them enough.",2013-10-07 13:27:10,"{'food': ['Foie gras soup', 'Pork belly', 'Octopus', 'Salmon'], 'drink': ['White wine', 'Rose', 'Merlot', 'Mudslide']}"

I went for the third time this past weekend and have yet to be anything but extremely pleased. The expansive menu include a ton of creative appetizers and specialty rolls. The service is quick and the wait staff is attentive and very polite. Of all of the menu items I've had, two really stand out and make me want to come back again and again.

1. Tuna pizza - slices of raw tuna atop a crispy and flavorful fried scallion pancake with a spicy mayo drizzled on top. This combines my favorite flavors of a spicy tuna roll and ups the ante with a bit of crispy fried goodness.

2. Bloomingdale roll - I've had this every time I've gone and have yet to find a roll like it elsewhere. Spicy every-fish-possible topped with a tiny bit of sweetness that makes this roll highly addictive.

3. Bagel roll - reminiscent of a philly roll but then each individual piece is lightly fried turning a typical sushi roll into something special. I love the added crunch from the frying and how the cream cheese melts a bit cutting down on its typical cold/chewy texture I'm not usually a fan of paired with raw fish.

I've also had a handful other rolls, the rock shrimp appetizer and the house salad. I've been impressed by all of them, except  the Ichiban roll which had a drop of a thick pink sauce on top of each piece that tasted way too much like fake sugary strawberry. I ended up taking the sauce off of the roll and then really enjoyed it. I think next time I go back I will order more traditional/clean rolls that don't contain too  much creaminess to balance out some of the specialty rolls.

At the corner of Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, its location is prime time historic Philadelphia. The reason we started coming here was because of the champagne specials. $18 for a bottle and it's not your super sugary cheap champagne.

For the food, most the brunch items cost between $16-$25 and the portions are large.

Apparently, Copabanana also shares this opinion about itself, based on its advertisements. Curious, I decided to give it a try, ordering a burger, Spanish fries, and a peach margarita. 

Like some other reviewers, I am also intrigued by the burgers. Although I ordered mine medium rare, my burger came out gray in the center instead of pink. They had literally cooked the **** out of it. No wonder it took 45 minutes for the food to arrive. It was like a piece of cement, sandwiched between two pieces of crumbly, stale buns. 

Onto the fries... This may be a matter of subjective taste, but I tend to prefer my fries crispy instead of soggy and oily. These so-called ""Famous Spanish Fries"" were basically a chewy mass of under-cooked soggy potatoes topped with melted cheese, peppers, and onion. Yummy. 

However... my peach margarita was awesome (hence, the two stars instead of zero, if that were possible).

We both ordered the special: Eggs Benedict with a crab cake. It came out in a timely fashion and with no issues. However the taste was just not impressive. Our english muffins were both burnt and the crab cake just didnt have a great taste to it. The potatoes on the side were very tasty and complimented the meal well. 

I will give the bar a strong kudos. She had bottomless mimosas and I just had a few pints. They had a very strong selection of both draft and bottles. And the mimosas were absolutely delicious. 

The manager was very nice and pleasent to us. However we did ask them to turn one of the TV's to the NFL playoff game and he never did. I dont think he was trying to ignore us on purpose but either way by the time we left the TV was never turned. And the restaurant was half full (or half empty depending on your outlook of life) so he wasnt too busy that he couldnt have done it.

In the end our bill was around $80. Which is on par for most brunches in the city with drinks. However we both walked away from the meal still hungry and looking for more.

The menu items are simple but seem to exceed their capabilities.

At least for me and my Korean food cravings :) I'd contend that it's one of the best places for Korean food in Philadelphia, but there's a lot more to this restaurant that makes it definitely deserving of 5-stars!

For starters, I say it's the best ""find"" ever because it is a good distance north of the city and you'd probably need to drive there. Since I don't have a car, I would never have known about it if it hadn't been for friends who HIGHLY recommended it (for good reason, I discovered!). However, they do have a parking lot, so at least that's off your list of worries. 

The inside of the restaurant is spacious and pristine, giving off a casual ambiance with a touch of traditional Korean elements. Hence, it can accommodate small groups fairly easily. For example, on my first visit, I think I came with a group of 6-7 and we all fit comfortably around a table, and could have probably seated just as many more on the adjacent table.

And now, the menu! As the name of the establishment suggests, its specialty is the soft tofu (soon doo boo) and it is SUCH a great deal at $10 for their different kinds! Kimchi soft tofu, seafood soft tofu, clam soft tofu, beef soft tofu, etc... yum! And they do it legit too - providing you with a raw egg that you crack into the stone pot of hot soup. Oh, and before I forget to mention, you can also adjust the level of spiciness when you order (if you don't specify, they will just give you the average spicy level, I believe). If you're not in the mood for soon doo boo, they do have other Korean food options on the menu. Admittedly, I typically gravitate immediately to the soft tofu whenever I visit, but I've tried the dak galbi once, which was also delicious and fairly generous in its portions.

Speaking of portion sizes, the restaurant is famous for their amazing side dishes that they refill if you ask when you finish (can't imagine how many plates they have to wash!). With the side dishes and the rice that comes with your main meal, it's a lot of food in my opinion. So basically, go hungry :)

And a final adorable touch is that they typically give you a little mint candy with the check, which gives the feast the proper conclusion that it deserves. Definitely a meal worth every cent in my book!",2014-10-03 00:31:48,"{'food': ['soft tofu', 'dak galbi'], 'drink': []}"

Sunday night (5/31/2009) we placed a delivery order, which we do about once a week.  One of the items we ordered was chicken fingers.  When they arrived, my partner opened up the chicken container and recoiled at the smell.  I sniffed them, and they smelled rancid, like fish gone bad.  I immediately called them and asked to speak with a manager.  I was told that there was no manager on site.  I told the person on the phone about the rancid chicken fingers.  They offered to bring out another order, but since our concern was that the oil they were using had gone bad, I told them I wasn't OK with that choice and requested a refund.  I was told that since I had paid by credit card, the only person who could do the refund was the manager.  Then I was told that my other option was that they could put a note on my accounting saying we were owed a free order of chicken fingers, but I didn't feel comfortable with that option, so they took my number and said they would have the manager call me back.  At that point we put the styrofoam container with the stinky chicken fingers in a ziploc bag in the refrigerator (as ""evidence."")

After a couple of hours no one had called, so I called to find out what was going on.  I was told that a manager wouldn't be in until Monday at 11:00 a.m.  Around 3:00 p.m. on Monday I called and asked to speak with a manager.  I was then told that the manager wasn't in until Tuesday.  I explained the problem to the person on the phone, and he asked me to hold on.  Then the line was disconnected.  I called back and asked if he had just hung up on me, and he said ""No, I thought you said it was OK.""  I said ""No, I thought you asked me to hold.""  He said ""OK hold on,"" then in the background I heard him say ""Matty, could you take this?"" and he put me on hold for 10 minutes, at which point the line was disconnected again.  I called back, and the line was picked up then hung up immediately (they have caller ID).

I then called back on my cell phone and asked to speak with Matty.  This was the guy I had spoken to the night before.  I explained the situation, and he said ""I offered to send someone out with your refund last night but you refused.""  I told him that that option had not, in fact, been offered to me, and that I actually would be happy with that plan.  He then said ""But what about the chicken fingers?""  I told him we had saved them and would be happy to give them back, which surprised him.  He looked at my account and said belligerently, ""I see you've ordered them in the past and never had a problem.""  I said, ""Exactly my point!  If you get food that smells like rotten fish, would you eat it?""  He reluctantly agreed that no, he wouldn't.

A few minutes later the delivery guy showed up with my refund in cash, and I handed him the chicken fingers.  The delivery guy then said ""They said they won't take your orders anymore.""  I shrugged and said ""Fine with me.""  I mean, we're moving in a month, so who cares, right?  But still... WTF?  We've been regular customers of theirs for YEARS, and the one time we have a problem, we're given the runaround and are told we can't order from them anymore?  At no point did I yell or curse at them.  While I didn't hide the fact that I was annoyed, I dealt with them in a professional manner.  I'm disgusted with their behavior.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the location is very strange. When you walk in to what is in essence a giant furniture show room it may feel as if you have been transported to a post-apocalyptic world where zombies may or may not suddenly swarm out. That is to say, most of the lights were off when I entered and an eerie background music played softly. And not a person to be seen. 

But don't be afraid! Once you step off the elevator you'll begin to hear the pleasant clattering of plates and chattering of people. 

The food at the Bistro was delicious. I've been to France a few times and I would put the food on par with what I experienced there. In fact, a large percentage of the guests in the restaurant were speaking French. 

I had the pate appetizer which was delicious. Following I had the chicken and risotto which was fantastic and in large enough portion that I had to take some home for my (lucky) husband to finish off.

We came on the recommendation of a girl from City Sports who did not hesitate in saying Blacksheep when asked where to eat, and were not disappointed. 

Upon our servers recommendation I had a Dirty Hoe (Hoegaarden and Lambic Frambois) which was amazing and everything she said it would be. She even helped us pick out our meals.
I had the sesame seared tuna sandwich which was everything I could have possibly wanted. The fish was perfectly cooked, the pickled slaw added a tangy bite and the roll served it well. I skipped the wasabi mayo since horseradish = death but if that's your thing go for it. I also added a side of the curry fry dipping sauce which I would have bathed in had the container been large enough.
My friend got the Guiness battered cod sandwich and it too was amazing. Light cod, perfectly fried and delectable.

We trudged our way through the design center, merrily window shopping along the way and arrived on the top floor where this restaurant is located.

The wait staff went in a few directions  - most of them were very efficient, quietly removing plates and refilling water in a formal manner, keeping their eyes downcast as if someone in the kitchen was waiting to hit them with a giant baguette if they dared to look a customer in the eye.  Our main waitress Emma was a delight- charming and funny and she really added to our enjoyment of the meal.

The d√©cor seems to go in a few directions as well - part of the dining room is on the formal side with upholstered chairs, another section has fun, modish red chairs and various colored spot lights -  I guess trying to create the South of France look.  Another area has barstools up against a shelf that look out to the city and hubby mentioned it might be nice to sit there and have a drink and I agreed.   There is a great view from the restaurant, maybe not the best angle to view the city from but it's nice to look out at all the sparklling lights.


We went for the ""Degustation Menu"" of three courses for $28 which included a Starter, Main Course and Dessert.    I started with a glass of Provencal ros√© and was happy to discover it actually tasted like the ros√©s commonly served in Provence - dry and earthy with flecks of sunshine in it. 

 Hubbies chilled cucumber melon soup had a surprising but delicious tomato base and was a sort of tasty gourmet gazpacho with chunky veggies. My roasted corn soup was very nice- smooth and creamy with a little sweetness from the apple and just a hint of smoke.  A basket of fresh rolls with an enjoyable pesto/olive oil dip was served with the soup.

Our entrees were mostly excellent - his scallops were perfectly cooked, sweet and nicely seared and he loved the eggplant ""caviar"" served along with it.  Though I couldn't taste the ""pistachio goat cheese crust"" that was described on the menu my salmon and asparagus wrapped in phyllo was juicy and rich and very good.  The ratatouille served with it was excellent; the grayish cauliflower puree was not since it was rather unappetizing, both visually and gustatorily (is that a word??).

I choose the profiteroles for dessert and hubby had the praline mousse with a roasted peach.  The choux pastry puffs filled with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with a thick chocolate sauce were good but honestly I like the way I make them better, these were a bit dry (whereas the ones I make are buttery and tender - no doubt mine are the incorrect way though!).   His dessert was brought out with a smoking lavender frond to flavor the peach and it did that splendidly - the mousse was rich and wonderful.  

Between the wait staff, the d√©cor etc I just had the sense that the restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis - is it formal or fun?  Paris or the Mediterranean coast in summer?  Their menu and service comes across as ""Fine Dining"" yet they have a wine club (buy 10 bottles, get one free) on their website - hmmm, I don't know.

I do know we had a great night out - the three course menu was a good value and liquor was reasonable as well.

From their list of specialty cocktails, my gin-loving self  tried the Jade.  It's nice and refreshing.  I got it less sweet and on the rocks. (and you should too!)

Dan dan noodles are so simple and delicious.  Something that I could probably just make myself, but why bother when I could just make a call and have Han Dynasty make them for me!   

Shared the above and the Spicy Aroma Fish special that had a spice level of 10 but wasn't that spicy for some reason.  I think it's because although it might look spicy, it was more oil than that ""punch you in the face"" spice.  The spice was more of an after hit than a ""tongue numbing"" experience.  Namean?
The fish was a flaky white fish and the dish was filled with veggies and some glass noodles, but it was a really oily dish that left me feeling heavy and unsatisfied - and it will not be ordered again.

...I'd been to Vetri before as a solo and this time I went back with friends who'd been as well but having e-mailed the restaurant to inquire about an extended tasting what we received was more-or-less every single dish on the Vetri menu that evening, each diner receiving a different dish for each course and each dish exquisitely prepared and presented - some identical to our prior visits and some entirely new.

Simply stated, when I walked into Vetri on 5/26/12 it was my second visit - the other visit, nearly 21 months prior, my favorite Italian meal of all time by a small margin. When I walked out of Vetri on 5/26/12 the prior meal was my second favorite Italian meal of all time - the Maialino, Monk Fish, and Sweet Pea Agnolotti all amongst the best new dishes I ate during my trip through DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia in May of 2012...and that isn't even mentioning the repeat dishes such as the gnocchi which rank amongst the best ever.",2013-02-24 21:20:11,

Service was slow and we didn't have one set waiter. 

The cheese puffs appetizer was nothing special - they were dry, but light.

The short rib fries were the best part of our meal - the meat fell apart and the cheese sauce was addictive. Totally worth the money.

My veggie burger was good, but incredibly dense and heavy. There was no way to actually pick it up and eat it on its bun.

Friend's hamburger was nothing special - bland meat, not enough cheese for the price you pay, and too big of a bun.

Other friend's BBQ Pork Sammy wasn't so much pulled pork, but thick, big chunks of pork, which made it difficult to eat. Also, the supposed ""whiskey BBQ"" sauce tasted only like tomato sauce.

4th friend's Kentucky Hot Brown was okay, but the bacon taste was overwhelming.

After seeing that Las Cazuelas is a BYOB spot, around 7:30 PM on a Thursday my boyfriend and I drove to the liquor store for some tequila (patron to be specific), which were about $6 each for the mini bottles (I bought 2, should have bought 4 ). Anyway,  we got to the restaurant around 8 PM and there were about 4 groups already seated, half inside half outside. It was a bit awkward walking in because no one was there to immediately greet us, but as soon as we saw thee ONLY server at the time named Josie, she let us know she would be with us. 

My bf and I chose to sit outside because it was a nice day in May hehe, and luckily we got there in time because more people started arriving after us. Oh btw, Las Cazuelas closes at 10 PM on Thursday. We were seated outside by Josie who was a great waitress; she spoke loud and clear, described the meals in detail and was very attentive. My bf and I started our meal off with a free pitcher of Pomegranate/Mango  Marguerita (bf's choice to mix, I just wanted classic ). Also the free pitcher coupon was received from yelp, Thank you yelp . So we then got the sampler appetizer for starters. I asked Josie what the most popular chicken meal was and she stated that it was the Arroz Con Pollo,  I got that and my bf got Nachos for the main course. 

By the time our main course came out, my bf and I were so full from the Marguerita, sampler, and chips and dip, we asked for two boxes to go and the bill. But from what I did eat... the Arroz Con Pollo was really good, the added sliced avocados on top really made it delightful and the black beans that came along with the meal were the best part in my opinion. My grandmother makes Arroz Con Pollo, so I can't lie, I did compare theirs to hers, but my grandmother is from Central America so of-course the taste is going to be slightly different. Nothing beats grandmas cooking though. I also tried my boyfriends Nachos... they were good as well, definitely authentic ingredients, I would say Las Cazuelas also makes their own chips because the taste and crunch is different then most, but I am not sure about that.

to start, we had the dips of the day, the bureki, and the cyprus plate.  all of it was devoured instantaneously.  for the main course, we all ordered from their specials list: one whole dorado, one lamb shank, and two hawaiian butterfish - one of which was mine.  it was so freakin' good!  the couscous was amazing.  i practically licked my plate clean.  my bf had the lamb shank.  i'm not the biggest lamb fan, but it was delicious.  my friend's husband had the dorado whole (they will fillet it if you want them to), and that was some really tender fish.  like whoa.

for dessert, we had 2 orders of the pistachio and olive oil cakes with almond ice cream (omg, to die for) and the assortment of cypriot pastries.  WOW.

by the end of the night, i don't believe there was a crumb left to be spared.  

among the other items on the specials list were lamb (i think?) testicles.  i tried to get one of the guys to order it, but neither had the 'testicles"" to, haha!  :)

our server was wonderful, the food was wonderful... hopefully we get to go back the next time we're in town... maybe for the brunch that has been reviewed a lot!

It's advertised as ""thin crust"" but I'd dispute that description. It's more of a medium thickness, with a pillowy texture, and it holds its toppings very well. Lastly, they don't mess around with ""creative"" toppings. If I want figs on my pizza, Rustica can't be beaten, but sometimes I don't.

I was going to write about how Chef Lawler was able to transform simple, local ingredients into dishes that were greater than the sum of their parts. I was also interested in seeing how other diners had enjoyed the ever-changing menu at this month-old eatery. But after reading the review by Katherine G., I felt inspired to respond to her serious error.

To begin with, I understand being seated an hour after your reservation is annoying. But where were they going to seat you? It is a tiny space with the only chairs being the ones occupied by the diners. Where did you want to sit? on the floor? In the bathroom? The coat check? Be reasonable. It is a 30-seat byob...

Now on to your critique of the food.  Katherine, I don't know where you trained as a chef. Perhaps at Le COrdon Bleu in Paris, the CIA in NY, or maybe you just volunteered your services as a stagier in many of the three michelin stars across europe. And yes, as a diner and a customer, your opinion is important. But to assume that you are a better judge of of the doneness of confit bluefish (a fatty fish slowly poached in oil) or the proper temping of a steak (medium rare in fine dining restaurants generally has a  line of rare running down the center, hence ""medium RARE"") is foolish. How you would prefer your food and how it was meant to be cooked are two different things and should be noted in a scathing review of a new gem in a culinary backwater. Lastly, just to fully correct your inanity, I did not have the pork the other night (i had the chicken, which was superb) if spaetzle is listed as farmers cheese spaetzle, it would imply that the cheese is in the dough itself, not on top. The same way that if you order ricotta gnocchi in the future you should expect ricotta to be inside binding the dough, and not plopped on top.

I'm sorry for singling you out, but your review is an unwarranted mark upon a very strong addition to the rather bland philly dining scene.

Oh wait, you did mean Barra? Okay, well you are probably reading this because you plan on visiting Barra in the near future. Maybe you are doing a bit of research before you go. After reading several reviews, you will find that there is a consistent message. This restaurant is simply just not that good. In a city where there are so many wonderful dining options, please reconsider attending Barra.

I visited Barra a few months ago for a friend's birthday. I live a few blocks away from another restaurant that is similar to Barra in many ways. Even the name is similar. The restaurant I am referring to is Birra on Tasker and Passyunk. At first glance, even down to the ""gabagool"" pizza there are many similarities between these two establishments, so much that I even pondered if they shared ownership. Birra is such an amazing place, so I was very pleased to discover all of these similarities.

When I walked into Barra there was not even enough time for me to get to my seat before my disappointment began to settle in. The incredible rotating beer selection of Birra was replaced by 6 domestic drafts and one beer that was described to me as a ""chocolately coffee-ish beer - it's gross"" by the waitress. The wait staff reminded me of the bullies from my high school.  They were dressed inappropriately, unaccommodating, defensive, and disconnected. It was clear that we were unimportant. We were simply another X amount of patrons that were going to give them Y amount of tip dollars.

I ordered a burger. The burgers can be cooked one of two ways - medium, or well. Admittedly, I was intrigued by the idea of a burger enclosed in pizza dough. It sounded great, so I ordered one cooked medium. Now I ask you, if you were to order a burger that is cooked medium, and this medium temperature is only one of two ways in which they routinely cook burgers, would you expect this burger to be cooked properly? Further, assume that this burger was to be cut in half prior to serving. Now also imagine the individual who cooked this burger, the same one that then proceeded to cut the burger in half, clearly viewed that the inside of the burger was most definitely NOT cooked to a medium temperature. Upon seeing this failure to properly cook to order, the cook then continues to serve the burger anyway. Under these conditions, would you send the burger back? I never send food back... however under these conditions, how could I not?

Along with the other unfortunate events that occurred during our experience, such as the garnish of long blonde hair on my friend's pizza, or the manager's refusal to accept our valid dining card discount, or another manager asking my fianc√© tips on removing a hickie in the bathroom, or the jarred sauce that ended up on my fiance's plate of mystery-meat pasta...

I did have to laugh a bit watching this for two reasons.  First right by the front door there is a sign that reads ""no cell phone use"" and secondly, while I was managing a Chuy's restaurant in college,  I would never imagine being on my cell phone in the front of the house.   With that said, the hostess in the back tried to locate our server which was even more comical to watch. The table next to us even commented ""now they are going to argue over who is going to serve you.""  Again very laughable because again in my past restaurant experiences on a slow day my servers would be fighting for tables to make extra money not fighting not to work.  
Instead of waiting for the servers in the back to decide which one would serve us, we decided to make their choice easier and just go sit at the bar in the front part of the restaurant.  I can say that both bartenders were great they promptly took our orders and when we explained what we witnessed in the back, one rolled their eyes and goes oh geez. 
Now, on to the adventure of food.  I ordered a chicken cheese steak and my girlfriend ordered a chickie signature salad with chicken.  Both pretty simple items for a kitchen to prepare.  My sandwich arrived within 5 minutes of ordering. Unfortunately the salad took over 25 minutes to arrive.  Again, in a busy restaurant setting, a time frame within reason, not a time frame in a restaurant with 20 people at the most.  Also as  I would imagine like most your commercial kitchen set ups, your salads are made in a different part of the kitchen than your steaks.  However my sandwich came out and sat in front of me for 20 minutes while we waited for a simple salad to be made.  While watching the manager zoom around the restaurant on her cell phone, it was very easily to see what was causing the delay in the restaurant.  When your kitchen staff is in the front of the house watching the replay of the flyers game instead of making food ticket times will be long.  
Overall this experience started bad and ended worse.  I feel the lack of attention by your manager is probably the direct cause of our experience. She obviously was more interested in her phone then what the employees of the restaurant were doing.   Also she lacked the motivation to take initiative when she clearly heard that we had been seated 15 minutes and no one had been by our table to check in with us.  
Now you may ask why didn't we ask to speak to the manager while we were there?  We asked, but were told they were busy at the moment.  Of course whatever was going on in her cell phone conversation was more important than customers sitting in her restaurant at that very moment.  I understand restaurants can be busy, and things happen.  Unfortunately, through my experiences in the hospitality industry I did not notice one reason for our experience today.",2013-12-31 18:28:48,"{'food': ['chicken cheese steak'], 'drink': []}"

I was greeted as I walked in and things got better from there. The restaurant feels like it belongs in the heart of Center City. It has a young, fresh and stylish vibe. 

I was there with my wife, so we opted to grab the Duck Fries as an appetizer. This dish was a flavor explosion. It had a nice layered presentation. The fries were cooked perfectly, and the shredded pieces of duck were nice and tender. The crispy bits of bacon, the sauce and the duck fat topped it off. For dinner I went with the fried chicken. the breading had a nice hint of spice. the chicken was still juicy and not overcooked. The included biscuit was a nice dense buttermilk recipe. Great for soaking up leftover sauce from the duck fries. My wife went with the duck mac and cheese. It was a very creamy sauce with some nice extras thrown in. The addition of cranberries was a nice twist. 

Making the experience better was the fact that the manager came around and talked to those who were in the restaurant. He was friendly and was open to talking about the food, some upcoming specials and what we thought overall. I'll be back for sure as it's nice to have something a bit different in the area.

Swing and a miss.

It was a Friday night, but pretty early, so the restaurant wasn't packed at all.  I was immediately struck by how the hostess was seemingly dressed for the gym, while everyone else was dressed like they worked at a restaurant, but that's not really what this review is about.

We ordered one of the appetizers on special--a stuffed mushroom...thing.  It was supposed to be portobello mushrooms stuffed wish cheese and spinach, with some balsamic glaze.  Instead, we received two stuffed mushrooms absolutely *swimming* in lukewarm balsamic sauce.  You couldn't taste anything except the sauce, which was a shame because I LOVE mushrooms.  

I also made a second mistake--ordering one of the special entrees.  This was shrimp and lobster in a spicy diavolo sauce over hand-rolled pasta.  The dish I received was ridiculously overcooked.  Both the shrimp and lobster were long-since rubberized, and I had to actually struggle to get the lobster out of the tail.  The fact it cost $32 just added insult to injury.  This wasn't a steak done medium instead of rare--this was two types of seafood cooked for so long that they no longer bore any resemblance to what they should be.

I will say that my date's dish (which was off the regular menu) was decent enough, though nothing spectacular.  Hence two stars.

Haven't been back since they rounded out their menu to include other sides, so this review is for the chicken alone.

The chicken was tasty, but definitely over-hyped. Thumbs up for being boneless. Thumbs down for the breading itself being mediocre. The most interesting part of the experience I would say is the dipping sauces. But I'm biased. Dipping food into lots of different sauces almost instantaneously makes my eating experience so much better. I liked the bbq and the chipotle lime mayo.

I think if they wanna stick around longer they should keep making different and new sauces (with having a few of the regulars always there) and making thicker juicier tenders.

Half of the restaurant was dim and candlelit and a bit crowded but kind of romantic. Where we sat was in the back room with bigger parties and a bit more space.there were some kids there which was nice to see because it makes me feel more comfortable bringing  our baby along next time! I wasn't really in the mood for a huge pasta dish so I ordered a caesar salad, which was huge and delish and crab chips. The crab chips are my new pregnant obsession!! They were perfectly thin crisp sluiced potatoes topped with yummy jumbo lump crab meat, old bay seasoning, and provolone cheese. Think Chickies crab fries but classier ( ha ha) with crab on top!!  I had them put the long hots on the side and no bacon. Even though I only had apps, I was still unable to finish as the portions were good sized. My husband had baked eggplant for an appetizer which was also very good. Im pretty picky with eggplant but this was great! He ordered ricotta tortellini, which he asked to come without parsley. Not only was it brought out with parsley but it was in the sauce and inside with the cheese in the pasta itself. He returned it to the waiter and at that point we were pretty stuffed and wanted to leave room for the yummy dessert we found not to mention we had tickets and didn't want to wait for a new meal to be cooked. Kind of upset with the waiter as he should've known what was in the meal, found out, or when he actually saw it filled with greens, returned it. Worse than the waiter was the manager who earlier during appetizers came to see how everything was and we said great. Problem was his response to us returning the uneaten meal was to have the waiter tell us that he had asked us if everything was ok and we should've told him them. Ok buddy, not only as a manager YOU should've come to the table when there was a problem but you asked us before we got our meals. Finally, we saw him again and I explained what had happened. He kept questioning by husbands allergy asking for a specific name and accusing him of eating my ""green"" long hots from my meal. He followed that rudeness with him saying that he would take off our dessert (choc chip cheesecake which was awesome). We explained the dessert wasn't the issue and his meal wasnt even touched. He continued to try to take of the dessert! Finally, we got our way. Geez!  We were appalled at how rude he was and what bad business that was. Luckily, it takes a lot for my laid back husband to get mad but it pissed me off. The food that we did have was great and we will be going back but it could've been a better experience if it wasn't for the cocky manager.

And the staff has remembered my name ever since noticing it on my credit card during that first visit.

If you like/know beer, this bar is a total win. Excellent drafts that rotate with regularity, and staff that know what they're talking about. Plus, they'll give you tastings.

They have a pretty extensive menu, lots of options besides sushi.  They have a few different lunch specials including 3 rolls for 12.  This is $1 more than the other sushi lunch specials in the area, but no big deal.  At first glance, they have a lot of options for the 3 roll special plus soup or salad, a list of 43 different rolls.  I went with spicy tuna, Alaska, and spicy scallop, plus a salad.  The waitress came back and said spicy scallop isn't included, I said it was on the list, and she said that was a mistake, so I requested the crabmeat apple.  I got brown rice for all of them.  She arrived with the sushi, and instead of crabmeat apple she had given me apple avocado.  I pointed that out, and she took the sushi away so they could make the correct roll.  She came back and my crabmeat apple was actually imitation crabmeat apple.  That's really not what I wanted, and there was no way for me to know it was going to be the fake crab, so I just didn't eat that roll.  It should say crabstick not crabmeat.

The spicy tuna was good, not too much mayo, and my Alaska roll had a decent amount of fish.  All the fish seemed fresh.  

Bill came, it's a 75 cents up charge per roll for brown rice, but 15% off right now because of the grand opening.  I'm willing to give it another chance, but considering they just opened and should be wanting to impress customers so that they return, especially when Vic's, Machi, and Tsuki, are a few blocks away, I was underwhelmed.",2012-09-24 17:25:41,"{'food': ['spicy tuna', 'Alaska', 'spicy scallop'], 'drink': []}"

I have to agree with all of the previous reviewers about the Shin Ramen snack which was hella spicy. Yes, it's a cheap way to keep your hungry customers from eating their own fists (a 90 minute wait on a Saturday night - could have been worse), but that's the kind of thing I like to do at home because I just can't help myself, so thumbs up for that.

Dennis L hit it head-on when he said ""The buns are delicious, but not $7 for 2 delicious."" Seriously. We also had the broccoli & sausage appetizer which was pretty tasty, but not $7 tasty. It's a shame because a lot of the tastes on the appetizer menu looked really intriguing but perhaps not worth the price.

As for Mr. Significant's brisket, he reported that the meat was a high for him (although I can't vouch as he didn't share - tisk tisk - but a sign  that it really was that good, I suppose.) In fact, all of the meats were the best part of the meal (the pork belly in the bun, the sausage in the broccoli.) I had the duck pho (not true pho as others have pointed out), but the foie gras meatballs in this dish absolutely shine. I'd like to take home about a dozen of those and never leave the house again until they roll me out the door. Oh, and also the egg in the brisket was nearly perfect. We love our runny eggs. (Could I just get a bowl full of ramen noodles and eggs? Somebody open up that kind of shop...)

Overall, Cheu was satisfying but there were things that didn't shine as much as other places. Music was a little loud, prices were a little high, but go ahead and try it. It's definitely worth seeing what it's all about.",2013-04-16 02:30:38,"{'food': ['ramen', 'broccoli & sausage appetizer', 'pork belly in the bun', 'sausage in the broccoli', 'foie gras meatballs', 'egg in the brisket'], 'drink': []}"

Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Being that it was a bachelorette dinner, we got our own private room which was nice. The server was great and was very attentive. He wasn't lingering in the room but always came just in time to refill drinks and check up on us. The restaurant itself was trendy and had a nice atmosphere

We got complimentary Truffle Popcorn (truffle butter, citric salt) which was pretty addicting. 

Appetizers:
1) Lemon Scented Hummus with herb & garlic naan bread
2) Charred Octopus (garlic & lemon marinated artichokes, olive oil)
both were pretty good. The hummus wasn't too bad considering it was an American restaurant (sorry... hummus snob here)

Entree:
Seared Salmon (with port wine braised red cabbage, bacon lardons): it was cooked pretty well and the portion was perfect.

Dessert:
Caramel Popcorn Panna Cotta (with sea salt, popcorn dust) - my friend had ordered it & I had to take a bite out of curiosity. It was surprisingly good!

Drinks:
1) Persephone (Appleton V/X rum, pomegranate juice, lime juice, agave nectar, muddled jalapenos & mint): a bit too sweet for my taste
2) Blue Sage (Milagro Silver tequila, muddled blueberries, sage leaves, coconut sugar, lime juice): the best drink of the night
3) Philly Love: was similar to a mimosa which was light and crisp.

The restaurant was almost empty when we arrived - there were 5 front of the house staff available for the 6 tables.

The seafood was subpar at best. We started with the Chilled Seafood Pleateau. For $60 - Maine Lobster, King Crab, Oysters, Clams, Lump Crab Meat, Shrimp Cocktail, Tuna Tartare.  

The seafood plateau arrived at a bare table - dropped off by one of the runners - and that was it. We had to ask for plates and a cracker to get past the shells. The lobster and crab meat were fine. The shrimp over cooked, the tuna stringy, the oysters small and the clams to fishy smelling to eat for our taste. 

This was a fast food version of a seafood tower after the one we had for our anniversary at the William Douglas steakhoust in Cherry Hill, NJ.  That was the BEST we have ever had - the seafood so fresh and amazing.

Next we tried the Hot Plateau seafood tower for $50. Crab Cakes, Roast Oysters,Steamed King Crab, Crispy Calamari,Coconut Shrimp, Steamed Mussels, and Clams Casino.

It arrived at a table full of dirty dishes and it was amusing to watch the runner attemping to put another tower onto a full table. We not only had to ask him to return to take items off of the table but also for additional clean plates.

The Hot Plateau was inedible! No crabcakes. The oysters had a burnt color to the breadcrumbs and a scorched butter smell. The clams looked exactly like the small oysters. The steamed mussels were in a very spicy curry sauce. The calamari were heavily battered and at best were a cheap premade frozen varity.

This was sent back - enough was enough.

The service was weak and inattentive. The food was not fresh by any standard.

The manager - never even one trip through the dining room!

As It happened, I stopped in with only my wife, and frankly, as a ""reasonable lunch"" there is not anything on the menu that provides better value than many other options in nearby Manayunk (where we could not find parking on a beautiful September Saturday.) There IS plenty of parking at In Riva.  The ""Industrial"" design is nicely done, and the river view tables (indoor or out) are a treat.  The menu, though (all in mostly unfamiliar Italian) shows very adventuresome ""outside the box"" preparations.  I wen for pork ribs, which arrived long-braised, in a sauce that tasted like sweetened hoisin with a touch of anise.  Three decent sized ribs were served on a small butcher block.  They were topped with crispy grated pear and crushed pistachios.   I could not fault them on inventiveness.  Braised pork ribs, though, tenderize the meat and cartilage roughly the same amount, so it was difficult not to take a big bite of gelatinous  inediblemness that needed to tactfully b removed from mouth to plate.  

Wife had pizza (seemed like the house specialty) and her cippolini / goat cheese / pancetta combo was interesting.

Service was friendly and knowledgeable, and a Peroni draft for four bucks was fairly priced (they don't seem to be really BAR oriented.)

There is no bread served, and salads / bruschetta were over 10 bucks, so you prett much get you entree (antipasti) and that's it.

1. Menu items don't match! For example, #32 and 33. If 32 comes with a small size. Then why 33 even exist says: all above the same expect for a smaller size pho. Then small 32= 33 right??? Also the 81 pic doesn't match! The pic says its avocado smoothie and in the menu it's another thing:((( 

2. Environment. Please seriously Decorate the place. Not just replacing with cheap decos. Use your heart to make this place nice. Put more cultural decos! Think more before you open. 

3. Service. The waiter doesn't even know which item is which he has to use numbers to replace. SAD... I'm sorry I don't want to be rude but he need to ask us which one we ordered... And he doesn't even know which pho is which... Please be more motivated and familiar with the menu.

4.FOOD. The most important thing. First, in a good papaya salad, the papaya should NEVER be shredded should be chopped. And shouldn't have so much watery underneath!! It's a salad not soup. The salad is badly chopped ;( don't mean to be rude here. And the color doesn't feel like exciting. I ate great papaya salad before and it has mango, red radish and shrimp and spice. It should be a colorful appetizer not watery something. 
I ordered a small delux pho and it doesn't even come with everything says in the menu:(( SAD...it's doesn't have beef meat balls which says on the menu. Also the taste. It's not bad but NOT GOOD either. It doesn't trigger appetite. I mean it's not a bad cooking pho but also not a good cooking pho. 

Please have glasses instead of plastic cups to serve.

There is also a small abundance of restaurants and coffee shops that offer up some delicious treats. 

George's sandwich shop is one of the more famous stops a long the italian market and it is well deserved fame. This small hole in the wall restaurant operates like a fine tuned machine churning out sandwiches as quickly as customers place orders. 

I ordered the roast pork and tripe sandwich. It was amazing! The roasted pork is not over seasoned and its just enough so you can appreciate the quality of the pork. The tripe is melt in your mouth and it does not taste gamey at all. If you ever had doubts of tripe, come here and give it a shot.

I would give this restaurant 5 stars based on service alone.  

We went in because we saw ""drunken duck"" on the sidewalk menu (and I love duck more than anything).  I tempered my expectations though, because I have a gluten allergy that prevents me from being able to eat dishes made with normal soy sauce and duck is usually prepared with soy sauce.  When I asked about it inside, the owner came over and explained that there is indeed soy sauce in the base.  But before my heart even had time to break, he told me that he could make a special version of it for me without the soy sauce.  A few minutes later, he brought out a ramekin of the sauce for me to taste test for spice level.  It was *delicious*.  

Needless to say, the dish was fantastic.  The sauce was a perfect mix of sweet, and spicy and the duck was crispy skinned with moist delicious meat inside.  Even the Chinese broccoli on which it was served was smoky and wonderful, having been doused in brandy & rum and set on fire!  (Extra credit for flair.)

And lest I feel guilty that the chef/owner went to all this trouble for me, he came out again after we ate to tell me that he enjoyed the challenge of preparing the dish without soy sauce.  If only all chefs reacted that way to customers' dietary restrictions!  Talk about above and beyond...

We will be back here for sure when we move to the city.

I have ordered take out from here numerous times because I like the deal and in a crunch sushi craving, it fits the bill. 

However, they aren't consistent.  Sometimes the rolls are prepared perfectly with enough fish to not make you question why you ordered from here, and other times, my roll is falling apart and I'm wondering how my Alaskan roll found its way to me sans salmon.

Wine was eh, but hey it was like $4. Cheese was great. We made the mistake of ordering two. If you plan on getting other food, you can easily share one amongst 2-4 people. 

We decided to get a bunch of plates and share them. All of the portions are perfect for sharing between two people if you decide on a few plates. We ordered the Spicy Jumbo Lump Crab-Stuffed Peppers, Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey, and Salad of Grilled Asparagus, Artichoke, White Beans, Tomato-Onion Relish and Pine Nuts. O.M.G. Seriously every dish was incredible. Stuffed peppers were perfect to start with because it was a chilled dish. The peppers were so fresh and the creamy crab meat stuffing left me nearly licking the plate. Next we ate the salad. They split it between two plates without even asking! The presentation was beautiful and the dish was incredibly flavorful. Everyone needs to get this dish that they call a salad. Lastly was our ricotta and honey crostini. I'm so glad we ate this last. It was almost like dessert with its smooth and rich ricotta cheese, topped with sweet drizzled lavender honey.

We had dinner with friends last night at Zorba's . Poor service started with the table they placed us at.  We had made a reservation many weeks in advance. When we all arrived, we were directed toward two roundtables each for two people, stuck together to somehow create a table for four. Picture trying to sit at a figure 8. It was awkward and uncomfortable, and our friends' chairs were in the walkway where waiters and waitresses had to rush back and forth. My husband and I were crammed next to a table of five, who turned out to be the loudest diners I have ever sat near in a restaurant. 
We asked for another table but none was available. Our
order was taken after a bit of a wait , and our appetizers arrived after not too long a wait. The appetizers were tasty. 
One hour after we received our appetizers, our entr√©es came. There was no apology for the delay with the entr√©es. The restaurant was jam-packed, and it looked to us as if the waitstaff and kitchen were overwhelmed. Three of us ordered the same thing, the octopus, which was tasty. My husband ordered the charbroiled mixed grill. It was actually inedible. Picture charred shoe leather warmed in the microwave. His vegetables were also awful, mushy and tasteless. My husband never ever sends food back to the kitchen. He should have sent this back but he did not.

I'll start with the hope for new life to breathe into this formerly charming neighborhood tent pole. I'm really rooting for them. 

I have had lovely experiences here. I have had wonderful pies, cakes, milk shakes- so lovely I am willing to brave the servers who sigh with disappointment at my apologetic face: ""so sorry to bother you, but I would like to buy a slice of your pie.""

Until I had one or two slices of of disenchanting desserts, and then my bravery decreased. Tonight might have been the last straw, however. 

TIME: It was 9pm, (late for Philadelphia on a Sunday), and we had a sweet tooth. 

CLEANLINESS: The restaurant is usually casually shabby, but tonight's counters were covered with dirty towels, sticky dishes, and and melted lumps of cream, (front and back counters). 

FOOD: The pie was a continuation of our downward experience- burned in places and raw in others. What happened? It used to be so good! My hot chocolate was cold and more syrup than anything. 

SERVICE: The girl at the counter was her usual, ""just barely tolerating a customer,"" posture.  I found someone who told me in a friendly tone that she was the owner, and I let her know about our experience being much lower than we expected. She explained the restaurant was out of the usual chocolate recipe, but then asked, ""have you had our pie before?"". I'm not sure what that had to do with the bad pie, but she said she would check up on the matter. 

She didn't really seem concerned. And that's perhaps my concern- no one at More than Ice Cream appears concerned with keeping a clean place with consistently decent food, and generally friendly service. 

I hope this changes.",2014-12-22 03:45:37,"{'food': ['pie', 'hot chocolate'], 'drink': []}"

Nothing like it closing in a few weeks (July 30th) to get me here, right? It's actually just moving to the newly expanded Parx Casino by the end of 2017. 

We hadn't been here since it was Di Vinci's and it was our bachelor/bachelorette party out in the Isaiah Zagar mosaic courtyard outback. Luckily that hasn't changed and I hope it never does as it's quite lovely back there. Definitely try to sit back there on a nice night! 

Our party of 8 walked in on a Sunday night with no ressies and we were seated immediately outback. Our kind waitress brought us pitchers of water, paper goods, and wine glasses for our bottles as the space has remained a BYO! 

The fam started with the house meatballs which were two to an order for $10 which the fam thought was just a hair overpriced. (They said $8 would've been more fair). They were split between 4 adults who raved about them. The men split hot wings also which they said where very tasty and large. Hot sauce or Italian garlic were the choices, also $10. 

The fam tried pesto pies and their classic house tomato which we feel is an obvious must. Veg heads, the sauce contains no cheese and the crust no egg, so enjoy! Ask for half mozz if sharing or just peel some off your slice as it's added in large chunks. The group was highly impressed and didn't know what I was taking about when I told them about some lower star ratings....

The ultra thin crust on all pies was perfectly crispy and the slices held their weight without flopping over. The sauce on the original tom was filled with fresh tomato pieces and wasn't too sweet or acidic. The deliciously fragrant pesto with loads of ricotta was noted to be very rich and the kind of pie you only have one slice of. 

3 pies and 2 apps for 8 of us including 2 kiddos was the perfect amount of food. No leftovers and we all left very fulfilled. Too full to indulge in some house made cheesecake. Perhaps take a slice to go as I've heard it's pretty good. 

I must admit I came with low expectations as it has very mixed reviews. The table including very picky diners all gave it a 5 star rating except one 4 star and one 4.5 with a majority rules, 5. 

If you're a thin crust kind of person, get here before it closes or definitely make it a point to stop by if you find yourselves at Parx which is said to have some major incredible upgrades including a concert venue soon.

This was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a while.  They really do focus on every little detail. The duo of Ribeye was AMAZING! It had a beautiful smoky flavor and was extremely tender. This was served with a glass of consomme and herbs which you sip in between bites.  We also ordered a side of Macaroni and Cheese  which came out on a little boat and served with individual macaronis. I've never seen mac and cheese served this way, but it was beautiful and delicious.

HsHA4KtX1qfFnvnZYpdl9g,DihTsliUxbqpoA9W3uRDBA,cXSyVvOr9YRN9diDkaWs0Q,4,6,0,3,"Based on the reviews, I was expecting to wait forever on a Sunday morning.  After finding parking around the corner, we put our names in and were told the wait would be 30 minutes.  However, we only ended up waiting 20 minutes AND we were able to score a table (one of four) outside.  Yay!

Upon sitting down, we were quickly greeted by our waiter who came with two glasses of water.  Started off with the sticky cinnamon bun special, which was warm, fluffy, and not too heavy.  The pecans on top added a nice crunch.  For my entree, I got the Honey Cristo.  This was definitely the breakfast sandwich of champions!  I really enjoyed the challah french toast.  The amount of double smoked ham was rather generous and it was oozing with Swiss cheese. MmMmMm.  It's always fun cutting into sunny side up eggs and watching the yolk smoother itself on your food, but for me, it wasn't really necessary.  The mixed green salad that accompanied the Honey Cristo was okay, but probably put their so you wouldn't feel half as bad for eating this sandwich.  

I also tried their burger special (sides are separate) and fried green tomatoes.   The burger was super juicy.  The bpatty was huge and I loved the bun, which made the burger that much better.  The fresh jalapenos added just the right amount of heat.  The fried green tomatoes were just okay.  They were lightly battered and crispy, which I liked.  But, I think eating one was more than enough.  Their homemade ranch was delicious, though.  

Service was great.  Out waiter checked on us multiple times and made sure we were happy with our meal.  Honey's was cash only, but they have an ATM inside.",2014-06-16 13:55:03,"{'food': ['sticky cinnamon bun special', 'Honey Cristo', 'challah french toast', 'burger special', 'fried green tomatoes'], 'drink': ['water']}"

Showed up in the early afternoon on a gorgeous 65-degree (late October) day and asked to be seated outside; the host brusquely told us they were not serving outside ""because of the weather.""  Sat at a table inside which quickly became a little too crowded for comfort.  I understand the family-style quick-turnaround small-rest nature of the place, but being nearly sat upon and having to move to another seat to avoid knocking elbows repeatedly was not what I expected.  The kicker was the fact that less than 10 minutes after my party of two requested outside seating and were denied it, outside seating was opened up and we were neither informed and asked if we wanted to move out there nor apologized to. 

Food-wise, we ordered a rotolo and a melanzana pizza.  The rotolo was fine.  The melanzana had great promise, but the stracciatella  was ice cold and very watery.  One of my favorite pizza places (in another city) is famous for its ""Cold Cheese"" -- in the moment between removal from oven and distribution to customer, a generous handful of grated mozzarella is sprinkled onto the piping-hot slice so it melts a bit but still retains its cheesy integrity.  Delicious.  This was anything but.  The crust would have been delicious had it not been charred to a very black crisp and made milky, watery, and cold by the stracciatella.  Can't comment on the eggplant because i was overwhelmed by cold milkyness.

I am prepared to try other pizzas from Mr. Vetri, and don't feel justified making an executive decision on quality based on one experience and one pie, but until my mind is swayed i will not be recommending this establishment.",2016-10-30 16:25:49,"{'food': ['rotolo', 'melanzana pizza'], 'drink': []}"
