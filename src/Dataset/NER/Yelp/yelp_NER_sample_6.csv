This is a great place for breakfast anytime (served Tuesday-Sunday 8AM - 3PM), but do be aware: it is popular on weekends.   The breakfast and lunch menus provide many choices, and the sides (many with a Jewish flare) are great, especially the potato latke.  The pancakes and biscuits are exceptional.  Look for the specials, which usually emphasize seasonal fruits or, in the case of omelets, fresh vegetables.  The atmosphere is laid back (maybe a little too much so, service-wise).  A great place to seek out on a nice day.  I note that they will soon open for dinner, too.",2006-09-20 17:16:23,"{'food': ['pancakes', 'biscuits'], 'drink': []}"

In my opinion, they have some of the best margaritas I've had...especially for the price. They're strong and not too sweet, awesome. What really blew my mind this past visit was the pulled pork sammy. We added cole slaw which was the best idea ever. The pork was tasty, moist and juicy and the bun didn't fall apart!

ATMOSPHERE:
Its a huge sports bar with big windows, wood everywhere and more TV's than a Vegas kino parlor.  And they have THE coolest restroom decor I've ever seen!

FOOD:
Crab Fries - Apparently their specialty.  The fries were average but the dip is to die for!  Not sure why its named that way as there's no taste of crab. 

Cheesesteak Nachos - Huge portion with a good amount of toppings.  Very good. 

Lobster Cheesesteak - Meat, fresh lobster & cheese sauce.  This isn't the best cheesesteak I've had, but maybe if it came with real cheese it would've complimented the flavors better. 

Mussels Marinara - A family member's dish, so I just tried one.  Tender & lots of flavor but I'm not a big mussel fan. 

Dungeness Crab - Tried a portion from my hubby.  It's good but mainstream.  Nothing unique. 

SERVICE:
We walked in at lunch time and got seated in about 15 mins.  Our female server wasn't the friendliest of people but she did check on us throughout our meal.

It's really not worth it if you are more than two people. All of us pretty much left starving. We're fixing snacks as we type. The dinner is served family style and we noticed that they would give the same portions (1 dish) to a table for two to a table of four. There were seven of us and they gave us only 2 small portions of each dish plus a chicken each (thank god for the latter). They could have easily given us another dish seeing as 1 dish =  1 table for 2. The whole thing came across as a bit too thrifty on their side and was not an all together positive dining experience. The table of four next to us also audibly complained when they got the same amount of food as the couple right next to them.

BASICALLY:  7 people shouldn't be getting only twice the food TWO people are getting
and it seems cheap, shifty and just disrespectful to do it that way and charge everyone the same amount. Did I say we all left hungry?

I loved my brisket ramen that also came with kimchi and a perfectly cooked matzo ball.  The brisket was super tender and the broth was quite flavorful.  The chili garlic wings were also fantastic - crispy and huge.  My boyfriend got the spicy crab noodle special they had which I didn't like as much.

I am a big fan of guacamole and Xochitl's is fresh which is a major plus in my book and has the right amount of lime and cilantro which a lot of places get wrong.

Beyond that-we were excited for the food. My BFF's steak was cooked poorly-meaning it was well done and he ordered medium rare. That though, wasn't ultimately the issue. When the bill came, we both gasped as we learned that his 32oz steak was a whopping $100-at place that dos not rival Barclay Prime in elegance or in substance.

When we inquired about said price, we were met with defensiveness  vs a respect for our surprise and bewilderment. If our waitress had been forthcoming with the price-which the GM said they commonly do not disclose-he would not have ordered the steak.

In the end, we compromised on an amount for the steak, but our collective pallets, minds, and hearts were ultimately disappointed especially for an establishment that bears Kevin Spraga's name.

unfortunately, both the burgers and fries and margaritas were all average in my opinion, compared to other restaurants in university or center city.  

for the burger, you choose the type of meat you want and then a type of topping(s) below on the menu.  I opted for the Charleston, which ended up tasting like another average burger with meat quality average enough to not be too distracted from it.  

for fries, I tried their spanish fries which is essentially fries mixed with fried onions and peppers - fries overall were on the more moist, potentially soggy side, versus traditional fries that you imagine being more crisp.

you can also ask for their small side of garlic mayo which they will charge you for .59 cents per small cup to dip with your fries or put on your burger.  

for the margaritas, I opted to for the orange-mango frozen margarita which was average as well - it tasted more diluted in my opinion and not as well blended with some large enough chunks of ice to disturb the consistency of the drink.  If you get it on the rocks, they will give you the whole shaker to pour the margarita yourself.

I would say if you are looking to simply fill yourself up and eat with a friend or more in a casual environment, whether indoor or outdoor, this place is solid.  If you come for their daily specials, especially on wednesday's, when they have half off burgers for ~$5, this place is more worth it in terms of price and food quality.

Philly deserves a new image makeover.  Sure, the Phillies play in a baseball stadium that has a cell to dry out the stupid drunks but the enlightened, gracious, California chill hipsters that run Gastro Pubs like Khyber Pass more than make up for their meathead minded shortcomings.  

I love Philly Hipsters, especially the ones that work at Khyber Pass. Unlike Brooklyn Hipsters,   they're not as obsessed with showing how cool they are, they just are by being way more considerate, chill and better looking which would explain why they're so much more comfortable in their inked out skin. Also, Philly Hipsters get to savor a much richer selection of craft brews and hard to beat Gastro Pub fare that's blessed with all the local foodie touches at half the Brooklyn prices which must be the other reason why they're such a pleasure to be around. 

I went there on a Saturday Afternoon with my wife and 15 month baby girl.  Our waiter nodded towards a corner seat and told us to make ourselves comfortable. I loved how non-frenetic and low key he was about us getting situated. He acknowledged us in a measured, warm way but wasn't running off to grab a high chair either. But I was ok with that laid back attitude because we didn't take forever to be acknowledged or get frozen out because our kids threw their four star yelp coolness rating into jeopardy. 

We've been taking our baby girl to bars in NY since week 2 and this was by far her favorite one. She spent the entire time playing on the party tattered, liver lived in floor which made it the most wholesome, G rated Bar Crawl ever.  We fed her the cornmeal coated, extra meaty, bomb briny, oysters which she scrambled for with blazing, Randall Cunningham type speed.

My pulled pork sandwich was scrumptious and hearty, but not a rib rattling Rocky Balboa gut shot either.  I thought the dosage of vinegar could've been scaled back a tad yet the extra sour snap wasn't overwhelming or hard to come to grips with either.  Also, the coleslaw on the pulled pork sandwich was  zesty, refreshing and breezier than an Elton Brand turnaround fader.   Last, the toasty Kaiser roll used in the Pulled Pork sandwich made made me smitten for more poppy seeds which was a surprise.  Normally,  I have no love for a seed that is respected more for it's staying power than it' great stuff  like Steve Carlton

Also, the beer selection  here was as good as it gets.  On tap, it had more glittering studs than Allen Iverson. I had the Evil Twin Saison which comes all the way from Denmark yet selections such as the IPA Saison from Flying Fish got me even more excited knowing that their beers are hard to spot around the Island of Manhattan.  I also had the Saison, collaboration, between Dogfish, Victory and Stone at some dumpy bar in Wilmington DE that Labor Day weekend which is further evidence that Philly is worth dumping New York for based on their beer selection alone.",2012-06-05 04:04:15,"{'food': ['pulled pork sandwich', 'coleslaw'], 'drink': ['Evil Twin Saison', 'IPA Saison', 'Dogfish, Victory and Stone']}"

The noodle soups are absolutely to die for. I ate the barbecued pork noodle soup today (N4) because I had been thinking about it since LAST Sunday when I went there. The egg noodles are great and made in house. The vegetables are fresh. I eat the wontons last because they soak up the broth and are even better at the end than they were at the beginning. The coconut rice is a delicious side and has the perfect amount of sweetness to it.

Water is always full. Not to mention all of the food I just listed, a huge lunch for 3, came to a grand total of $19.

If the great food, atmosphere, and prices weren't enough - the family that owns it is completely fantastic. A brother and sister do the serving and know every single customer's name after only asking once (and in my case - they never asked at all, I just came in one day and they said ""Hi Jessica""). They are warm and friendly and really make the restaurant.

I came here for a late dinner, just wanting something small and light since I've been eating all day. It's a pretty small and cozy place, with a few tables outside. All the tables were taken, but we were able to sit at the high tops where they made the pizzas. Best seats in the house!

They were super efficient in making the pizzas. All the ingredients looked fresh and plentiful on the pizzas themselves. The pies coming out of their wood burning oven looked amazing. I enjoyed watching them make them through the night. Looking at that, as well as the menu, I didn't want anything small anymore but wanted to try a little bit of everything.

Got the Italian Cesar salad- anchovies topped the salad so it had that saltiness in each and every bite. The pizza dough as the croutons were warm and doughy.

While waiting for our pizza, they had an extra calzone and hooked it up for free. Thanks!

Got the pepperoni and crudo pies. I love the crust of these pizzas- perfectly charred from the oven. The pepperoni was crunchy and not oily. It was like eating tiny pepperoni chips! For the crudo pie, The prosciutto was great with the buffalo mozzarella and every bite was salty and creamy. 

Even though we were full, we wanted to try the nutella pie for dessert. So glad I did! The pie was again perfectly charred and the nutella and marshmallow was perfectly melted. I just wish I had milk to wash it all down.

Overall a great experience. The hip hop music playing in the background topped it all off. It wasn't too loud that you could still hear yourself carry a conversation.

1. The best damn old fashioned on the planet, no fruit cocktail here!  Just 100 proof bourbon, lemon ice sugar cubes and their house made bitters!  They stir, add, stir, add till the bourbon expands upwards - takes about 12 min!!!  Worth every penny.

2.  THE BAR STAFF IS FABULOUS!!!  My personal fav is sasha, she has my old fashioned started when i walk in the door.  All of the bartenders are awesome.  They will show you how to make drinks, answer questions about the bourbon at length and take care of you like no one else.

3.  THE BEST HAMBURGER IN TOWN!  No lie.  Free range angus.  Its worth every calorie.

Ok the con - the small space.  With product and service this good it was silly not to have made the place bigger.  They did it intentionally but it was really a bad idea.  Why they couldn't have made it bigger and tinto smaller or even put tinto elsewhere i really do not know.  

They loose business more and more because people can't stand the crowds and the wait for a table.  A place that small really needs to take reservations.  I myself always go there first and am frequently disappointed that there is no space.  Its just awful.  

That said - if you go at off hours you may have luck.  To this day i have never sat at a table.  So one or two friends going is good. three is pushing it.  A large group - take them somewhere else.

I chose a buffalo blue burger off their specialty menu. You're asked how you want your burger cooked, which usually makes me nervous. If an establishment asks for temp preference, they had better nail it. Lucky for me, my burger came out perfectly medium and my fellow diners were also pleased with their orders. 

The first thing that impressed me about the burger was the SLAB of blue cheese sitting atop the sizeable, mouthwatering patty and the nice drizzle of buffalo sauce encompassing everything. No blue cheese crumbles here - this cheese chunk was like a deck of cards in size! No complaints from me about this burger!

I snuck a few fries from my friends - truffle fries were nice and light and crispy. Sweet potato fries were also good.

It was a Sunday night, around 7 o'clock. They told me to pick it up in 30 minutes (I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato and Maria's sandwich which consists of prosciutto, mozzarella, and tomato). I thought 30 minutes was a little excessive but figured they were probably busy with dinner service. So I arrive to pick up my food about 35-40 minutes later. Not one car in the parking lot, not one person in the restaurant area and I'm told my food is STILL not ready. I ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes for a piece of grilled chicken and a COLD sandwich. The grilled chicken should not take too long on the grill and the other sandwich didn't even require cooking!! The girl at the front desk was not apologetic at all. The cook came out 3 times to talk/flirt with the girls at the front desk. All around it was very unprofessional. 

So I get home to try my sandwich and was not pleased at all. The grilled chicken sandwich was literally a piece of flavorless chicken served on a hamburger bun. Yes, a hamburger bun. The other sandwich was not for me but I had to try it. Again, flavorless. I will not be going back here ever again. For the record, this was probably my 3rd or 4th time ordering from here only due to the fact that it's right down the street from me, and every time I've had to wait a long time for food and/or the food was not good.

All of the margaritas were good, but my favorite there so far is the prickly pear margarita. It tastes VERY good paired with certain tacos. 

My favorite taco: Shrimp taco, i could eat so many.

my favorite parts about going here that makes this food place stands far above the rest
- their desire to please the customer: beer while you wait in line? now thats what the customer wants
- choices for people who love authentic tacos but also choices for people in your group who are picky eaters 
- margaritas are delicious
- you do not have to carry your food to you table 
- quick and easy because it takes out the time waiting for a server to come and take your order
- adult friendly
- family friendly

people say the tacos are tiny portions but seriously i ate two and was stuffed. My boyfriend who is obviously larger than I am ate three and was full so i find that incorrect because it was the perfect amount for us. I recently brought my sister here who used to live in Philly to Buena Onda and she was so happy to find a place to go with her friends and boyfriend when she visit. 

The staff is also incredibly nice. thats refreshing because i have been to places with great food but the staff wasnt friendly so it made me and my party never go back. staff really does contribute to the customers overall experience.

The wide variety of food trucks serving up treats can satisfy any palate, however the trucks I wanted to go to the most had lines that were borderline ridiculous.  Not sure what the fix for this would be... perhaps I need to show up 10 minutes before opening to secure a good spot in line? 

Anywho... The live bands were great and created a perfect summer kick-off ambiance (the 80+ degree weather didn't hurt either), and it was really awesome to see so many Philadelphians (Fairmounters and Non-Fairmounters alike) congregated in one place to celebrate Philly's finest food trucks.

The location was great for Fairmount too, since if you were sick of waiting in the beer line you could very easily pop into the local Wine & Spirits shop for a juicebox of wine, or pop into one of the restaurants for a drink.

Four Stars

The place is small, hip, and crowded. I put my name on the list at prime time Friday night and it was only a 15 minute wait. I enjoyed an Anderson Valley Gose ($5.5) outside on the sidewalk while I waited. I sat at the bar. I ordered a Miso Ramen ($14) which is a dollar increase from their website. The broth was light but packed with nice salty and umami flavors. The thick curvy noodles were undercooked a bit but not unenjoyable. The egg yolk was a perfect velvety texture and white was just solidified. Plus the seasoning on it was on point.  The braised pork shoulder was not very fatty but nicely rendered with nuances of smoke and salt. It was warmed under a broiler and topped with a barbecue-like sauce on it. There were not any sea beans but some sort of pickled cabbage. The raw bean sprouts were a nice pho-like touch. 

Overall, the service was friendly and great. The food was prepared with consistency and care. The price point was reasonable.",2015-10-24 00:13:34,"{'food': ['Anderson Valley Gose', 'Miso Ramen'], 'drink': []}"

The restaurant itself is really cute - gelato in the front, pizza (party!) in the back. Lots of space, classy decor, and I'm always a fan of seeing the actual open fire pizza grill. It was also very bright, which was a nice change from the dim lighting that I think so many places are embracing these days - my parents didn't need to use their cell phones as mini flashlights to read the menu, which is always a promising sign!

Service was a lovely mix of attentive without being overbearing, and our server was incredibly pleasant. When he noticed that most of us were vegetarians (he heard me make a vegetarian-related comment while we were ordering) he made sure to tell us which items were made with chicken stock, and offered to bring us lard-free bread, which isn't their normal recipe. I so appreciate that kind of recognition and sensitivity to our eating habits.

The menu itself is really generous - a handful of apps/snacks, some salads, a soup, a few pasta options, and probably 15 kinds of pizza! Plus a really extensive beer/wine/cocktail list. We opted for the arancini, the eggplant ""meatballs,"" the house salad, two pizzas, and a calzone. The starters were really good - both the arancini and the ""meatballs"" had four little fried balls per serving, which were very tasty, but not super filling, and the house salad was also solid - I liked the addition of a few crispy fried onions on top. 

My parents and I were able to comfortably share two pizzas - we went with the Tartufello and the Genovese. Both were really yummy with unique flavors, and despite having a plethora of ingredients, neither one felt heavy - like we could eat a lot without needing to be rolled out of the restaurant (#winning). But...like some other reviewers have said, the pizza literally feels wet. The middle of the pies were both soaking, for lack of a better term. The crust has no holding capacity, and we really needed to use a knife and fork to eat the ""tip half"" of the pizza - once you get closer to the crust, you can pick it up, normal style. I don't think this necessarily made the pizza bad...but it was a bit strange. I'm sure that this really is the authentic style that they're going for, but it might be nice to give diners a heads-up at some point during the meal that this consistency is normal.

Although I didn't have gelato on this visit because Philly is currently the same temperature as the Arctic Circle, I've had Capogiro gelato at other locations and it is truly drool-worthy, so I know it's a deadly combination to have it offered under the same roof as tasty pizza. Overall, this place is worth a visit - just prepare yourself for the pizza :)

(Note: After writing this review, I actually researched ""wet"" pizza, and turns out, authentic Neapolitan pizza is soggy in the center and usually can't be ""hand held."" So, lo and behold Capofitto knows just what they're doing and this style of pizza is totally a thing! Mangia!)",2016-02-12 16:21:44,

As far as overall value goes, this is extremely affordable for the buffet and the options provided to you. The buffet can vary in options but generally has popular dishes most expect at an Indian place along with several vegetable and dessert options. 

The customer service is very attentive and friendly and I often see that they have regulars that they are casual with and I think that's nice. 

I found out through a friend that they do serve lassi's (just ok tasting) and gulab jamun (included with buffet) but you have to request these which is a bit strange as they do not even offer a regular menu when ordering buffet. It kind of makes me wonder what else they offer via special request. 

Realistically I give this place 3.5 stars only because the food has been hit or miss when I come. Sometimes it's flavorful and excellent while other times there are several dishes lacking substance and flavor.

We were asked to wait at the bar for a table and probably would have waited even longer had we not taken the initiative to ask the  hostess again to seat us at one of the open tables (""Oh yeah, sure, go ahead..."").   I was pretty excited about this place having read all the rave reviews.  We ordered some drinks and deliberated long and hard on what we wanted our burgers to look like.  I opted for mushrooms & fried egg on mine, and husband asked for crab salad on his.  We patiently munched on tater tots as we waited for our burgers and fries.  When these hefty sandwiches finally arrived at our table, we oohed and aahed a bit before digging in.  The first bite was quite tasty I'll admit, the patty nicely seasoned.  Though I ordered mine medium, it came out medium rare.  A couple more bites and the whole thing just started to fall apart.  Before long, the burger was swimming in a pool of meat juice and egg yolk, not the most appetizing thing to look at.  I didn't manage to finish mine, but I liked it well enough.  
I think that  the main problem, though, was that we weren't blown away by any aspect of the meal.  It was just... nice.

Unfortunately, the sandwich that I got after my long wait did little more than quiet the craving.

I was psyched to see that the ""grown up grilled cheese"" listed on the menu board featured Taleggio, arugula and jalapeno-peach jelly.  Sadly, as I reached the truck a staff member erased the Taleggio and wrote in a fairly generic substitution of Monterey Jack in its place.  The event was packed and we were there on the late side, so I don't fault them too much for running out of the Taleggio.  However, they kept charging the same price for the sandwich!  WTH?

Whatever - I had waited that long; I was getting my grilled cheese.  I had high expectations, and what I received was underwhelming.  There was a meager ratio of ingredients to bread; the bread was hard and dry; the cheese was not melted the whole way through; and it seemed like they salted the outside of the sandwich.  There were a few bites in the very middle that actually had a reasonable amount of cheese, arugula and jelly that made me realize what the sandwich could have been.  For a place that calls itself the ""Say Cheese"" truck, my grilled cheese should have been more than just ""acceptable"".

Curiously my husband went with the non-grilled cheese option, a roast beef po'boy, and got a really great, substantial sandwich.  It was $2 more than the grilled cheese, but that $2 got him a LOT more food.  His sandwich added a star to the review all by itself.

Between the four of us we sampled the short rib, the sausage, the brisket, and the enchiladas. Our house vegetarian was thrilled with the cheese enchiladas, and we carnivores enjoyed all the meats, although the short rib was definitely best. Sandwiches were under $10 and came with a side of fries. Good fries, but not outstanding. In Philly your fries have to be something special to stand out.

The night's big winner was the endless chips and salsa. I don't know for sure, but I suspect they make their own chips. In any case, the chips were fried crisp and dusted with cayenne. The green tomatillo salsa was good and the red chipotle salsa was fantastic; both were pleasantly spicy, but not mouth burningly so. As advertised, every time a bowl was empty the waitress offered to refill it. The Texans were miffed that there was a charge for chips and sals at all, but even they had to admit that the $2,50 was well spent.

My friends and I looked at each other, then placed our orders of chaat and lassi. What is chaat? To this day, I still have no idea. It's a colorful mixture of spicy meat, vegetables, crispy pieces, yogurt, almonds, chickpeas, potatoes, dried fruit, and about six different sauces. Never in my life have I experienced so many flavors and textures in a single dish. Fortunately, the mixture is both delicious and satisfying. The spices deliver just the right kick to pair perfectly with a sweet, cool lassi. I'll be back to try the other chaats. In the end, what really sets Mood Cafe apart is the exceptional service. The man behind the counter is friendly and loves to share his crazy concoctions with people whether they are first-timers or longtime customers.

Ultimately, Xochitl gets one star because I do not have a ""no star"" option.  My friend and I dined here last night for restaurant week and had really been looking forward to it.  Neither of us had been before, so we thought Philadelphia's Restaurant Week would be a great place to give it a shot.  WRONG.

We arrived on time for our 7 pm reservation and were asked to wait in the bar area until our table was ready.  Not a problem.  And understandable on a Friday evening. Although the restaurant was not at capacity we didn't think twice about being asked to wait. About five minutes later, we were seated and our very nice server came to explain the menu and the customizable guacamole.  

We made our guacamole selection and placed the order for the remainder of our 3 courses.  As far as the food goes, the guacamole was the best thing we had.  I ordered sangria that was supposed to have peaches, but instead had grapes and apples.  I'm not saying that's impermissible, but it's totally different.  Lol.  Just saying.
Anyway, from there, the courses went down hill.  The four cheese empanadas were a bit undercooked.  My main course, which the waitress described as their signature dish, was ok but did not make a real impression.  And the dessert....the churros.  I thought that was a safe choice.  WRONG.  They're probably normally excellent, but when I bit into it instead of the lovely, sugary sweetness that I was expecting, I tasted onion and garlic and lots of other savory spices.  Perhaps they had a shortage of oil in the kitchen.  Who knows?  

BUT HERE'S THE REAL PROBLEM: Our waitress brought us the bill and we were winding down when the manager, Adam, came over to our table and said, ""ladies, I hope you've enjoyed yourselves and that you will come again.  If you'd like to continue enjoying yourself, I suggest you go to the bar, but we need the table.""  Now is probably when I should point out that there were other vacant tables in the dining room and that the couple next to us was in the process of leaving, But I digress.  Apparently there was some special reason why he needed our table.  So we proceed to stare at him like he was crazy.  He took that as his cue to continue talking.  He said, ""we've been TRYING TO WORK AROUND YOU, but you've been here for THREE HOURS and we need the table.""  We had not been there for three hours, it was slightly over two, and it was a four course meal. Moreover, we had to wait for our table.  Ultimately, however, if their primary concern is just turning tables and not providing a nice dining experience, then they shouldn't be in the restaurant business, nor should they participate in Restaurant Week.  

When we started gathering our belongings, my friend asked the manager to move because he was blocking her chair.  After which he said, ""I don't allow people to talk to me like that.""  This was unbelievable.   I have never been treated so poorly by a staff member at a restaurant...EVER.

After that it took 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us again despite the place being empty and there being 2 other serving staff but I did notice a couple of people coming in to pick up take out. The decor is quaint put the place is small and tables are close together so as it began to fill up it did get a little loud. When we finally did order we started with the Duck Fries and Mac and Cheese. The Duck Fries were good, the portion is definitely enough for 2-3 people. I was disappointed with the Mac & Cheese it was just ok  it reminded me of Kraft Mac and cheese it had a runny cheesy consistency I was looking forward to a baked Mac & cheese. Tom like the Mac & Cheese so it really is about your personal preference. Our server read off a long list of specials & I was impressed that she remembered them all,me on the other hand I forgot them & ended  having to get her to remind me again because she disappeared for 10 minutes. I ended up ordering the blackened ravioli which I found out when they brought them out had hot peppers on them, they kindly took them back so I ordered the Ribeye which was worth the $40.00 price tag. Not only was it cooked to perfection the seasoning was out of this world. Since the specials are recited to you and not written down I was surprised when I got the check at the $40 price but it was a good cut of meet that was accompanied with some potatoes and mushroom. Tom had the Northeast Burger and said he liked the Burgers at Gallo's Burger Barn better, again it is all about preference. In conclusion I had a good enough experience that I would try the place again Tom said he would pass, he felt like it was too loud, wait staff could have been more attentive and specials should be written down with the prices published. We both mentioned that to a gentleman who may have been the manager and he said we can always go to their Twitter page to look them up.

To start off we had a 9pm reservation and was not seated until at least 10:30pm (we waited patiently, some of us anyway).  Then once we were seated we waited again for anyone to even acknowledge our table.  Someone finally came and bought over silverware and stated they would bring back bread.  We finally received the bread I would say about 30-45 minutes later sitting in a whole stick of melted butter. If it had not been for the birthday cupcakes we bought with us we would have starved to death. I believe it was his brother but not sure who finally came to wait on our table (Ty?).  He was superb, very apologetic, and gracious, because we could tell he was not suppose to be waiting tables.  We ordered appetizers which came out in a reasonable amount of time I would say (Wings, Crab Fries, and Shrimp) all superb, the wings are the BOMB!  Finally we ordered our entrees.  Shortly after placing our order the waiter came to tell us several of our orders weren't available (thad just about ran out of everything we came for mainly being the fried lobster) . The food came out about 12am one by one.  Needless to say we didn't get back to our hotel until 1:27AM from being here since 9PM.

They have very limited seating, which is kind of annoying since I have to walk a bit of a ways to get here from work, just to turn around and get back to my desk to eat.  Although, I will say that the few tables they have here is better than the center city location, they only have a few stools and a long table against a wall.

I really like to make my own creation, I usually get the salmon with various veggies such as the papaya, jicama, carrots, etc.

I also like either the spicy mayo or the peanut sauce as my sauce.  The only reason I have not trued the other sauces, is because there is no description of them to be found and the restaurant is usually pretty busy when I am there, so I feel like I am holding people up if I ask. The staff usually wants to get you order quickly and get to the next customer.

I also enjoy either the fried shallots or garlic as my crunch.

The odor.  I was put off by the overwhelming pork/bacon/sausage smell.  I realize these items are on the menu, but so too are they at 99% of restaurants, and most places don't have that overwhelming odor.

The crowded tables.  We were seated literally one foot away from the next couple.  They were on their first date.

Lunch items aren't served until 11 A.M. - if you go any earlier you're stuck with bagels (I believe they're called ""squagels"" by virtue of the fact that they're squarish and not circular) and other items I don't really consider to be ""real"" food.  I tried the jalapeno and cheddar squagel on two occasions - I ordered cream cheese with it and it was fairly tasty to my sleep-deprived, 7 A.M., slightly off-game taste buds.

The Asian chicken salad was acceptable and the piece of bread it came with was fairly good and added value to the meal.  The chain also offers a 1/2-salad, 1/2-sandwich combo which is a convenient (though obvious) idea. I usually get the Tuscan pesto chicken since it's the least offensive and least messy of the sandwiches I've ordered here (the chicken tinga sandwich is a bit messier - the guacamole and stringy chicken bits tend to spill out of the sandwich when you bite into it) and I order a salad with it.  I've never gotten a soup here.  

The coffee is acceptable if not memorable.  The brownies and cookies don't exactly taste homemade, but if the mood strikes you, they're available.    Going back to the sandwiches - order them raw (not toasted) since the toasted bread is crunchy and hard.  Also, the Tuscan pesto chicken tastes better without melted cheese.  The latter ruins an otherwise quasi-healthy meal.  I've never gotten the carrots with a sandwich, but I've opted for the pepper-flavored kettle chips.  Raw carrots don't particularly appeal to me.  For beverages, I do recommend their lemonades (mojito lemonade or raspberry lemonade) albeit they're full of empty calories.

Pub and Kitchen strikes me as a fairly run of the mill entry into the gastropub arena. Very nice interior rehab job? Check. Pretty awesome selection of beers? Check. Couple fancy, gourmet-ish items on the menu? Check. Yawn. The thing missing was something to separate this place from the crowd. Why would I go here instead of any other place just like this? Jonny Brendas has whiskey donuts. The Tap Room has tacos of the day. The Royal has one of the better burgers around, not to mention innovative uses of pork that surprise me every time (mmmm, pulled-pork nachos with beer cheese sauce ... I digress.) This place had ... 18 dollar fish and chips. 18 bucks??? Seriously? For fish and chips? Maybe you should've saved some money on the fancy interior so you could serve some food for a reasonable price. Listen up Pub and Kitchen (and you too, Devils Den!): If I wanna spend 40 dollars on dinner, I'm not going to a gastropub, not when there are better dinners to be had for $40 (pick your BYOB) or much cheaper gastropubs with the same food! I don't get the 20 dollar entree movement in these places, it really makes no sense.

One other irk: our waiter was nice, but he had to have come to our table like 45 times during the course of the meal. Body language my friend, it will tell you all you need to know, like when we are done with our menus (see: putting down menu), when I need another drink (see: drink close to or completely empty). This ain't rocket science homey. (UPDATE: As I read through all the other reviews, bad service is a recurring theme.)

I went with a couple of friends and we ordered the General Tso's wings w/ wasabi blue cheese, the Pork Roll burger, Blue Duck Fat Fries and Blue Duck signature sandwich. 

Here are my honest opinions on the individual dishes. First the Blue Duck fat fries. So so good, maybe even the best surprise of the night. While realistically they were little more then cheese fries with some added flare, they were quite good. Even without the sauce they were cooked and seasoned perfectly. That being said the portion size could have been a little more generous given the price of this side.

The General Tso's wings were okay. Pretty much what I expected so I wasn't disappointed with the wings or the sauce them self. However the wasabi blue cheese was lacking the punch and heat I'd expect from that combination of flavors. The taste of wasabi was barely present and completely over shadowed by the wing sauce and the blue cheese.

The Pork Roll burger was delicious ! The the seasoning of the meat and the Sriracha mayo worked great together. My only true gripe about the burger is the use of the tiny cheap store bought potato rolls that are suppose to contain the massive meat patty. The burger nearly fell completely apart the moment I picked it up off of my plate. 

The burger has an egg and sauce topping which means you already have to apply pressure to hold it together, which also means the bun needs to be strong enough to withstand that pressure without breaking apart during the completion of the meal. There are lots of local bakery's near by and an Acme up the road in which to buy a bags of Amoroso Kaiser rolls so no excuse.

Lastly there was the Signature Blue Sandwich. My feelings about this sandwich are mixed because while it wasn't a bad tasting sandwich I wouldn't make it my signature sandwich. The Pork Roll burger was much easier on the palate. A little too sweet for my liking and could've used some complexities in flavor.

Bottom line: this place is overpriced.  Case in point in the tomato and mozzarella appetizer.  It's $9.75.  I understand that appetizers and desserts are the place to mark-up prices, and that's fine. These people run a business to make money.  However, I cannot respect a restaurant that gouges its customers.  This particular appetizer is one tomato cut up (prob cost them 50 cents), a few small mozzarella balls, and then a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette.  A dish that costs them $2-$3 to make should not be priced at $9.75.  Similarly, a bottle of beer, Stella, cost $7.  Furthermore, the menu prices on their website are out of date and misleading.  Another case in point: the veal saltimbocca.  On the website, it's listed as $23.  In the restaurant, however, its $25.  This is one of my favorite dishes because of the prosciutto that is traditionally supposed to cover the veal cutlet.  At Ralph's, there were three tiny bites of prosciutto.  I honestly don't think I was even given one full slice, let alone enough to cover the veal.  

I think Ralph's offers traditional Italian food in a great atmosphere.  However, in a city like Philadelphia where Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen, Ralph's has to do much more to make it worth your while.  The food isn't bad, but it's not great either.  On top of serving lackluster food, they have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for it.  I can think of at least two other Italian restaurants in the city where the food is better AND cheaper.  Ralph's is the perfect example of a once-great restaurant that is now resting on its laurels and relying on name only.

Took a suggestion from a respected fellow Yelper, Christian S., and tried this place. Well let's just say I only got 3 tacos and boy did I want more. I already knew what I wanted before I got there. Online menus serve a purpose people, if nothing else it helps you narrow down your choices and if you're like me, it pretty much helps you walk into a new place looking like a pro. Back to the matter at hand, I ordered 3 shrimp tacos, fish of the day was perch, no thank you. And Mahi Mahi, is a little too strong for my subtle fish palate. So 2 glazed shrimp tacos and 1 fried shrimp taco it was for me. Took it to go. First I definitely appreciate the care they place in their to go containers. They serve their tacos on these taco triangle thingamajigs in the restaurant which help the tacos to stand up. Well lo and behold they have a cardboard version of it for the take out tacos. Major points for that, they seriously take tacos serious... So I ordered my tacos and a drink and I waited. A girl at the bar who was eating told me to place my number in the holder. That's how they identify you. It was appreciated but probably not needed only because the restaurant wasn't busy and when the lady bought my tacos out she called me by name. But the hospitality was gracious. 

Got to my car cause I had somewhere to be, opened the box of tacos and one side of the cardboard taco holder had flattened and my fried shrimp taco was all over the place. No biggie I just put the taco together. First bite, the glazed tequila lime, or whatever shrimp taco. It was good, two nice sized juicy, sweet, perfectly cooked shrimp in the taco. I was in love. I had been searching for a great shrimp taco and I think I found it. I had one at El Camino a few weeks ago and it was abysmal, lacked flavor and totally disappointed my taste buds. Not this taco at Buena, was fabulous! The chipotle crema was really tasty and had a nice zing. Now I love hot sauce and was about to put some on mine but I'm glad I didn't because the crema provides just enough bite. Now onto the fried shrimp taco. Batter beware, really good breading and batter on these shrimp. Kind of tempura style so the shrimp aren't buried in the breading. It was a smidge salty but I am really averse to any salt at this point in my life so don't take that as a cautionary measure from me. 

I forgot to mention that they have Boylan's soda on fountain tap. Umm yesss because this is my favorite soda ever, well that and Frank's and Dr. Browns, but these sodas are so yummy it was nice to see it somewhere as a fountain drink as opposed to the big box soda dealers...

My side notes and suggestions: They should increase the size of the soda cup. It's small for the $3 they charge, even if it's Boylan's. If you're hungry order more than 3. If it's your first time order 3, then order more if you like them because you will be hungry. I forgot to order the corn with mine so that may have helped stave off my lingering hunger after I ate my tacos. Finally, they have a rewards program. Really nice to have for a non chain establishment. 

Finally, I expected these tacos to be good. I mean come on, it's from Jose Garces who had like the best taco truck, Guapos Tacos, in the city for a while. Plus pretty much everything he, Stephen Starr, and Michael Solomonov seem to touch or open in this city you can pretty much guarantee a good meal.

The line around 12:15 was considerable, it probably took 15 to 20 minutes before we exited with our food (to go). So how was it? My experience was slightly tainted by an order mixup... when I got back to my office I found that although I ordered The 500 burger, I was missing lettuce and tomato. The bacon, however present, was pretty chewy; I'd prefer it much crispier. The burger itself was cooked to order and the combination of burger, brioche, roll, and cheddar really came together nicely. I inhaled it. I also accompanied this small wonder with the truffle fries. They were delicious, the truffle taste came through in every bite, but they were incredibly salty. For the rest of the day I staggered back and forth to the water cooler to quench my thirst, like a man walking through a desert that also has a water cooler in it. This place has some potential and I'd definitely try it again, but I'm not sure if I'd eat here any more than once a month. For those looking for a miniature version of the fabled Rouge burger, there is one distinction: The Rouge burger is topped with divine gruyère cheese while the 500 burger is only available with swiss, provolone, cheddar, or American.

They were just right and cooked so they were still nice and crunchy and the flavor came through brilliantly in the sauce, which had a rich sweet gingery zing.

The food is consistently great, the servers/bartenders are always knowledgeable of the menu (which there are different daily specials) and how to pair the best libation with your meal.   I am a beer drinker and I'm confident that there are few other establishments in Philly that can rival the Khyber's beer selection. Which changes weekly btw. 

My only challenge is that I always ask my server to surprise me with a beer of their choice so I never remember what I had the time before. The only parameters I request is the abv i.e. 7% or below.  Which often times 80% of the beer selection is well over 7%.  Generally when we go back, the options have changed but are always good. I wouldn't recommend going in looking for a Miller Light Draft.  They're proud beer connoisseurs and they may laugh but suggest a great local, light beer.

The entrees came out hot but nothing to write home about - they changed their noodles for the lo mein which was one of the reasons we go there. The sauces were flavorless.

This alone made me want to come back, as I like to patronize places that welcome dogs, but the food was SO good  I was by myself (exept for my dog) so didn't order an appetizer, but I got the burger, which came with parmesan fries and a garlic aioli.  The burger was the best I've ever had - great quality meat, uicy & perfectly seasoned, and it came with mushrooms on it, which I normally don't like on a burger, but they were phenomenal on this burger.  You can also order it with a quail egg on top, which I think I'll try the next time I get the burger.  The fries were delicious, thin & cripsy, and I could've eaten the aioli with a spoon, it was so good.

2. Cambodian was a new ethnicity for us. Very exciting!
3. It was BYOB which we always appreciate.
4. On our first pass we snagged a parking spot less than a block away. Very lucky in this crowded part of South Philly.
5. We walked in to this tiny cozy place at 3 PM on a Sunday and snagged a table right away.

Everything was going so well it was time for a bump in the road. The first thing our very pleasant waiter did was list the seven items, that's right seven items, which they were out of.  This included all the skewers and several other dishes. The carnivore in me was completely ready for those beautiful sticks of meat and I was to be denied.

It turns out that they were slammed on Friday and Saturday and this was the result. Also, it's happened before. LESSON LEARNED- Sunday afternoon maybe great for snagging a table but bad for availability of menu items!

So with limited choices available we picked PRAH-HOK KAHTEEH ($8) as our appetizer. It was delicious and a perfect way to begin our meal. Some folks may think that dipping raw vegetables into a meat sauce is a little odd but trust me, it works.

For our meal we decided to split two dishes. The first was PLEAH SACH-KHOE. This was delicious marinated beef with kaffir lime and lemongrass. It was so good it was beyond five stars for both of us.

We also devoured a CHICKEN CURRY STEW that was incredible. The texture and layers of flavor in the broth brought smiles to both of our faces.

It used to be one of my go-to places for cheesesteaks.  I frequently traveled from South Philly to buy sandwiches, but on my last few visits, the experience was horrible.  There is a new cook who simply is unskilled or uncaring about making sandwiches.  This lack of skill or disdain shows up in the quality of the food.  The woman that takes the orders gets more miserable by the visit.  The cook has changed and it is not for the better.  My last visit I had a confrontation with the cook about pickles on the side.  Even the other employees seemed embarrassed that this was going on.  If you have heard of Larry's reputation for great food, please move on.  That day has passed and the customer service absolutely sucks.  It's sad to see a well regarded establishment come to this!  I read in other reviews that the management changed and it has.

Now, I've been to the Han Dynasty in Old City and what we got was probably 30% the size of their entrees.  Price-wise, both Sang Kee and Peking are closer to me and more affordable for lunch so probably I will not venture here anytime soon.

I had pretty high hopes for this meal because the two friends I was with had been talking about taking me there to celebrate my graduation since I got my diploma in June. We ordered two baskets of crab fries for the three of us, and although we all have big appetites and were starving when we arrived, we couldn't finish them. The fries were wayyy too salty! I was told by J that they usually aren't, and judging from the pictures that others have uploaded, our crab fries were obviously very over-seasoned. A spent half the meal shaking the seasoning off each individual fry before eating it. I did like the cheese sauce but overall I was disappointed that the crabfries did not live up to the hype. 

I also had the Magooby--a sandwich with jumbo shrimp, pickles, onions topped with crab fries and cheese sauce. The funny name caught my attention (I should've asked where it came from!), and I ordered it even though it sounds like a weird combo, because weird combos usually turn out to be absolutely delicious, right (i.e. anything from Little Baby's)? Here, not so much. It wasn't bad--but it wasn't good, either. My biggest qualm with it was that the sandwich was cut in half before the fries and sauce were put on top, which made it difficult to actually separate the two halves without making a mess. Maybe I'm being picky, but I just don't like getting cheese sauce all over my hands!

We ordered the whipped ricotta vassi, which is an amazing opener, but within minutes of its arrival the pizza came..and then two salads..and then the antipasti and the pasta- all within a span of 5 minutes. Our table was crowded, we felt like they were rushing us out the door, and we couldn't savor the different courses of our meals. To me that was the worst part of the meal (though to our wet friend perhaps that seemed less offensive). The remainder of the service was slow and clunky.

All in all I was really disappointed by a place that I have really enjoyed in the past. We can all appreciate a few mistakes here or there or the bumps in the road that might come with training a new person. She was otherwise a friendly server and was doing well for her first night. But she could have used more guidance and it might have been nice to give a more seasoned server to a large party that made a reservation and made it clear we were celebrating a birthday.

Came here a few months ago with a friend for a weekday lunch but never got around to finish posting!

Ambiance: Cozy but small space so beware if you are trying to bring big groups. When it's warm the outdoor seating in the back is quite nice. Has the feel that you can just hang out and read during it's off-peak brunch/lunch hours, especially if you can snag that corner bench nook with some cushions!

Service: Our waiter was friendly and indulged us in some witty banter. I can see it getting a bit hectic when it's a full house.

Food: Mixed review with some pros and cons. Their scrambled eggs with apple and bacon were scrumptious! However, their creme brulee french toast was a bit dry for our likin'. But that's just our personal preference. Their fries were great! Something between a potato chip and a french fry, like a potato chip fry. Crispy but with some good fluffy potato substance. 

Drinks: Espresso drinks were well done. I'm obsessed with good froth in my cappuccino and this place hit the nail on the head.

I normally come during lunch when I'm at work and service is fantastic, but this time, I wanted to bring my husband to try the burgers and came at night. I was so excited, but then it turned into a disaster.

I ordered the Turbo burger again for the husband and I to split along with some fries. Paid with LevelUp and then she gave me the receipt. Upon looking at the receipt, I noticed that she charged me for a burger that doesn't even exist. Even the cooks questioned it. She was like ""oh, i charged you the wrong burger"" and prepared the refund process of the overpayment. She only gives me a receipt with no money back! I asked her where's the refund. She stated it was going to go back on levelup. WRONG! I have paid with levelup tons of times to know that your computer system and levelup are not connected to one another. Whatever you ring up on the computer, you must also do on the payment syetem. She stood there arguing with me then took money out of her drawer and the receipt I gave back to her and threw it in our faces and yelled saying now her drawer is going to be short. I requested for the manager and she stated she was the manager. Husband was furious that he said to cancel the whole order and refund our money. Again, refused to give money back for it, but then eventually did.

BTW...I still have not received a credit back on levelup! I'm still charged!!!! If I do receive the credit, I'll be more than happy to go back and give cash back to her.

it has an open kitchen - and I mean open: you can watch the dishwasher while you wait for the restroom if you want.

It honestly wouldn't be the first place that comes to mind for me for such an occasion and I did indeed suggest other restaurants, even other Starr's. I hadn't been to Jones in way over a decade so I figured maybe things had changed. Ehh. 

Positives: 

The sweet printed menu with the name of the event at the top. 

Mac and cheese was said to be fantastic. 

Nachos were another favorite. 

Shoestring fries were great and went fast. 

Whoopee pies went and the dairy free berry sorbet was delicious and well liked by all. 

Guava margs were good. A tad too much ice. Pricey. 

Service was fantastic! Thanks to Dalton and the manager, Steve. 

Vibes were fairly good. 

They went out of their way to provide a vegan meal just for me and it was delicious. 

Separate bills for drinks were appreciated. 

Negatives: 

The meal was very heavy for the last time we were dining. Not the restaurants fault. 

The pierogis were said to taste like frozen just ""jazzed up""   

The apps were preferred over the main meals. 
""Underwhelmed"" was a word used at the table.

No one was really thrilled with having to eat pre-select entrees and paying a set price which is what is required for a party our size (11 people)

Mac's prides itself on its large beer list which, while it is long, is not really that impressive if you know your beer.  Nothing on there is very unique, and the list is thinned out by the long section of humdrum domestics.  What microbrews they do have are not very impressive either.  While they do have a few hard to find beers, like the Old Speckled Hen, it's mostly made up of the larger, easily available beers.  Honestly, you can go almost anywhere these days for a Bells, Dogfishhead, or a Rogue.  Really, there is nothing WRONG with their section, but its nothing very clever, either.  Their large chalkboard beer list on the wall could use some updating as well.  Many of the choices were no longer available, and it sounds like they may have been gone for a while. 

I also wasn't terribly impressed with the waitstaff, but I did come around on this.  When we first sat down, our guy was a little odd, and gave off an attitude like he had much, much better things to do than listen to my questions about beers that he couldn't answer anyway.  For a weekday, and not a very busy one, either, he was very hard to get a hold of, and probably made it a point to avert his gaze when he walked by.  He did come around a little at the end.  When I was a little unsure on what to order, he gave me three very different samples of some of their best sellers to help me make my mind up.

So, if you're in the area, Mac's might not be a bad choice for the convenience.  The prices aren't outrageous for the types of beer they offer or the neighborhood in which they're selling them, and the food that my friends ordered looked pretty fantastic.  They seemed to enjoy it, and the sweet potato fries I snatched were pretty good.  Unless you got yourself a Groupon, like I did, it's not really worth the trip across town.

When it arrived it was a thinly sliced baked potato with a whole short rib on the plate next to the short rib.   Presentation of the dish was lackluster.   My bone in rib eye was cut from the bone and stacked in two pieces end on end. My wife ordered off the restaurant week menu....reasonably priced for 3 courses.  However her 3 courses were all disappointing.  The soup seemed dull and thrown together.  The main cod fish entree was ok.

The truck is also very clean. Look around where the food is being grilled...realize he does this everyday and look how clean the truck is.

But we were starving and didn't feel like wandering around much. Nearly some thirty minutes after we sat down, we were finally acknowledged and asked what we would like to drink.

Our food took forever to come out from the kitchen. Our server wasn't all that personable or apologetic for the slowness. She even forgot my soup that I ordered. I can't recall everything we ordered, but my sandwich was nothing special, and not all that hot as I recall. My guess is that it sat under a heat lamp for a few minutes before arriving at the table.

We looked through the pictures on Yelp and saw the various chaats and lassis and we just wanted to try it out to see if the hype was real.  We walked through the door and looked up at the menu board and felt a bit overwhelmed. We knew what we wanted but the owner gave us a nice intro into the world of chaats and how he prepares them.  He made us feel welcome and comfortable and we really enjoyed the additional service he provided right off the bat.  Now let's get to the food!

Chicken Tikka Salad Chaat:  The chicken was absolutely delicious!  Fresh chicken with the same great tikka taste mixed in with salad greens, chickpeas, cranberries, juicy mango slices, and all of the chaat accessories as the base. It was well worth every penny and every bite just made you want to keep going. Many restaurants that offer chaat have a bland taste and sometimes its either too saucy or their isn't enough of the sauce to coat the chaat but this place had it just right.  I'd highly recommend the chicken tikka chaat or chicken tikka salad chaat for first timers.

Paneer Tikka Chaat:  Spicy, sweet, and tangy at the same time with every bite.  Cranberries with paneer were a great combo and the shredded paneer blended in well with the chaat mixture.   The mixture of sauces were perfect and the crispy chaat pieces were crunchy all the way through the meal.  No sogginess = more taste!

Now for the lassis:

As someone who is critical of lassis and find that most stores just make glorified smoothies with mounds of sugar, I found the lassis at Mood Cafe rather pleasing.  I ordered the blueberry and peach lassis and both were pleasing.  The blueberry was a bit more tasteful than the peach lassi and I'd highly recommend it for first timers.  The peach was a bit more difficult to taste but it was still a positive experience.  Both lassis had just enough salt and sugar and not overwhelming to a point where you'd feel like you've had enough.  

Final Conclusion:  The owner is a terrific person who really works hard to please his customers.  He's mastered the chaat world and anyone who wants to experience good chaat and have a positive experience, they should definitely stop by!",2015-02-17 03:28:11,"{'food': ['Chicken Tikka Salad Chaat', 'Paneer Tikka Chaat'], 'drink': ['Blueberry Lassi', 'Peach Lassi']}"

The wait for a cheesesteak was approximately 8 minutes which I was told at the register. No problem.

I sat down and opened my cheesesteak and the steam and delicious smell poured out of the cheese paper! I was a bit disappointed to find my roll had been charred on top, but I dove in. The sandwich was almost as delicious as I remember from downtown. The steak was well seasoned and wonderful! The whiz and onions were on point!

I must have looked lost reading the menu because another customer stopped to offer his recommendations.  Hassan upon learning it was my first time for chaat told me he would explain everything and the menu would only make me more confused.  He spent more than five minutes explaining what a chaat was, how he made it, and the differences between the different menu offerings.  He told me that number 9 was the best place to start for the beginners and asked me my spice preference.  It was really nice that he explained the process and paid careful attention to my preference (when I said I wanted spicy but wasn't sure if that was American spicy or Indian medium he gave me American spicy and put hot sauce on the side so I could customize it).  He told me that he would guide me through the menu and options on subsequent visits.  I really like that he sees it as a 'journey' through food.  We ate at the restaurant; there aren't a ton of seats but a lot of people get take-out so its not an issue.  Hassan brought us small glasses of Banana Fig Lassis so we could try them.  When we had finished the meal he asked how I had liked it and explained how chaat isn't something served in restaurants because of the complexity, variation, and customizable character.  He said each menu option was characteristic of the cuisine of a certain region, but that by no means these were the limit to his food creations.  Hassan truly approaches chaat as an art - it is completely customizable.  He let me try each of the crunch toppings individually so I could get a sense of the ingredients and how chaat is composed. He said you can only find mango lassi at Indian restaurants, but he figured why not have a rose lassi or a passionfruit lassi.  He promised he could make any kind of lassi or milkshake I could think of - which I take as a desirable challenge :)  He even gave me a spoonful of the rose petal jam he uses to make the rose lassi.  He says he makes it out of real rose petals, not just extract so it has real rose flavor.  It was awesome and I'm definitely going to order a rose lassi when I come back.  And for those wondering what chaat is its basically a salad on crack - it has a thousand ingredients, spices, sweet, sour, spicy, salty crunchy, balanced, and fantastic.  I definitely recommend it!

Before I go on my rant, I'd just like to credit waiters like Kevin and the manager ( bald guy) who were phenomenal because they actually do their jobs and build personal relationships with new customers even when they aren't my servers, and therefore have no incentive for doing so. That is not just customer service, it shows great personal character as well. Because I could do nothing for them as far as tips, but they were still helpful anyway.

However, I seldom get Kevin and I ALWAYS get the increasingly incompetent women waitresses who don't do their jobs correctly and that is what destroyed the whole Han Dynasty experience for me. 

Every time I come in, the place is not that busy at all, so there shouldn't be any excuses for any customer mistreatment. For example I was there the other day, one of only three people in the dining room during lunch, my water was never filled, and I had to get up out of my seat to ask someone else for extra rice because she never came back to see how I was doing. I even had to get back up to ask her ( the white, slinky waitress ) to bring my check. When she gave me my check she didn't come back for 20 minutes. She wasn't even busy, she was counting her tips about 5 tables away from me. Kevin saw this neglect and processed my payment for me. I wanted to tip Kevin. I should have put zero dollars on the tip but I felt guilty.

I actually just started coming here, and I have been buying food for the past couple weeks, both takeout and eat-in. No more. 

The dishes aren't difficult to make; pork belly appetizer, and dry pepper fish can be made at home. I will be going to China Town today to buy my ingredients instead of dealing with the crappy hospitality that the waitresses provide.

Overall, the experience is ZERO Stars.

Food, however, is phenomenal. But when eating in, hospitality prevails over food.

From the staff to how they interact with customers via social media or in person, to the food; there's a huge reason why I'm there every weekend (because I don't have a social life, but that's a different story for next time).

Service:
I love when I walk in, I'm always greeted with smiling faces. I worked in the food industry since I was 18 to my early twenties, I know a fake, pasted on smile when I see it because their GM's demanded the ""best of the best"". No. I hate that. It's forced and honestly, it's exhausting having someone check up on you. All. The. Time. 

Yes, my mouth is full, so obviously I'm enjoying the food -- why are you asking me?! So, thank you Wishbone for letting me get my order, go upstairs and be a hermit. 

The staff is young so there's an uplifting energy since it's also on UPenn's campus. 

Atmosphere/Decor:

If I can get the name of their interior decorator, I would give them my first born, no lie. It's GORGEOUS. It's like I walked into an Anthropologie that sells fried chicken! The bathroom is unisex so those who are complaining are such diva's. 

Food: 

My boyfriend always make sure we're there on the weekends and would drag me out of bed just to get more fried chicken, just to eat them in bed happily. He also whines that they don't have his rice krispies treats anymore (whyudodis Wishbone?) -- so he's more in love with the store than he is with me.

The fried chicken is amazing, as well as the mac and cheese. I've never had a cold meal before, everything is always hot and delicious.

The location is optimal. It's along Kelly right by the river but not too much traffic noise or congestion. The indoor setting was a bit dull and cold but the outdoor dining was perfect. Great views of the river and runners, especially perfect for people watching which I do quite enjoy.

I requested a window seat, but knew it would be difficult without a three month reservation.  To our pleasant surprise my request was honored and we were seated at an awesome location over looking Philly as she sparkled like a city of gold. Service was spot on.

Def not the best cocktail I had.  I will def try something else next time I go.

Now to the menu. Everything we had tasted delicious.  For appetizers, my two friends had the mushroom barley soup. It was delicious, but a little tart from the red wine.  I had the smoked salmon appetizers and my other friend had the salad.  The presentation of the salmon was right on! I asked if the salmon was smoked in house and the waiter said yes, which sold me. The salad look amazing as well and my friend described the steak as good chewy bacon, but the Salmon was the winner.

For the entrees, we all had the filet and short rib duo.  The meat melted as it hit the fork.  No knife needed. The sauce that came with it was a perfect marriage with the baked and crispy potatoes.  Def way too much food as none of us could finish our plates.

Last came the dessert.  My two friends has the French toast with pear dessert.  It was decent, but nothing really exciting about it.  I had the coconut parfait.  There was tapioca topped with pineapple, a meringue, a short bread cookie, a french macaroon type cookie, and some kind of coconut sugar cookie.  It was delicious and very refreshing. My other friend had the milk chocolate hazelnut crunch bar.  That was such a delicious desert that was rich and light all at the same time.

The place is full of character, delicious southern-style food with fun twists, a great (though not exhaustive) beer selection, and knowledgeable down-to-earth staff.  You know what it is not full of?  Itself!  Always a refreshing bonus.

The meal in question was a Thursday, late-night, post-movie nosh with my husband after we had been turned away from a neighbor establishment that had randomly closed their kitchen early that night.  I was a little bit nervous, as husband has a somewhat limited (but expanding) palette, but we were hungry and thirsty and he was up for an adventure.  A summer weeknight in the city had the place pretty slow (~ 1/2 full bar, and just a few occupied tables), and we grabbed seats at the bar to keep an eye on the Phillies game.  The music was loud, but energetically rather than overbearingly so.  I was able to have a conversation with my immediate neighbor without shouting.

I had a difficult time deciding on food, as the menu was large and diverse, and there were also many specials available.  The overall influence was southern comfort food, but fancied up just enough to keep the comfort interesting.  I went with a great spinach salad with grilled shrimp, sauteed mushrooms and spiced walnuts topped with a simply delightful cane sugar balsamic vinaigrette, while my husband devoured a BBQ brisket sandwich with perfectly cooked shoestring (non-battered) fries.  I helped offset my nice healthy salad by succumbing to the temptation of a red velvet cupcake, which was only very good (rather than outstanding), but satisfied my sweet tooth nonetheless.

The bartenders were very cool about letting one sample a draft before committing to a pint (or half pint if you desire!), which is a nice touch.  When I requested a sample of a particular IPA (after finishing a pint of another), the young lady brought me a sample of the one I requested along with an additional IPA that she thought was even better.  She was right, and I appreciated her confidence in providing the recommendation.

My only regret is that I waited so long to actually try out the new Khyber after hearing the raves it was getting.

Even though the Soon Du Bu was really good, the thing we couldn't stop eating and nearly licked the plate over was a spicy chicken veggie stir fry called Dak Kal Bi.

We waited and waited for it to come back, wondering what was taking so long - surely they just had to throw a few more spices in?

While reviewing the menu, a man approached me and invited me in to try anything I liked for free. It turned out it was their first day and they were having a family and friends event.

It was late, so nearly everything was picked over, but I selected the shrimp taco bowl and took it home to enjoy. Despite the meager options available (like I said, it was the end of the night and they'd run out of most of the usual taco toppings), it was still delicious! Everything was so fresh and full of flavor! Another thing, and this is a big deal to me, their salsa verde had a really good bite. Most places skimp on the heat, thinking it'll scare people away I suppose, but this place knocked it out the park with just the right level of heat. Not too hot, and certainly not a wimpy pepper in that sauce! 

The staff was friendly. The decor was good. And the menu looked great. I can't wait to try the soup!

If you don't have a full hour or more to eat here, don't bother showing up, even if the place is empty.

Tonight I was a bit amazed by the service, or lack of it.  I arrived with a buddy for drinks and dinner, and arrived hungry.  When we sat at the bar, the bartender, one of about 5 people behind the bar working, came over and finally took our order for a drink.  We finished our drinks and wondered if they'd ask about food.  Instead someone eventually asked if we wanted another drink.  I had to suggest they take our food order which they said ""OK, you know what you want?""  So we ordered.  

The food was great.  The drinks were great.  It was a while between times of my first drink being empty and my 2nd drink offer.  We were surrounded by staff that ignored us, essentially.  They were friendly overall, don't get me wrong, but they couldve encouraged us to stay longer.  When we finally asked for the bill, I saw that my friends cocktail was covered by happy hour, though my beer wasnt, from the first round.  Happy hour, huh, no one mentioned it even.  I feel like a good staff wouldnt ignore you and they would let you know there's a happy hour offer.

The first thing that caught my eye was the sweet ass pizza oven (Renato?) positioned directly in the center of the place.  As I learned from one of their managers, it's the only heat source they have in the restaurant so all of their cooking is done in it.  They have several tables but for me, the real action is sitting at the pizza counter and watching the line do its thing.

Individual bins with dates are stacked on the left indicating which day the dough was made.  The guys working the line pull out a dough ball and begin shaping it.  Next, the stretched dough gets one set of a myriad of toppings (fresh sauce, prosciutto, aged cheese, tuna (yes they have a tonno pie) and then is whisked away into that oven.

Seven (7) or so minutes later, the pie gets kissed to the top of the oven and comes out piping hot with crispy bubbled edges.  Usually, the pies get a finishing of some sort (fresh herbs, some spice or a sprinkling of an aged cheese) before it's handed off to you.

The only rub of this place is getting a seat during popular times.  There are many great places to get a pie in Philadelphia (of similar quality) but none walkable from this location.  They've pretty much setup an outpost and it's working well for them.

At lunch, they have a pizza al taglio (by the slice) which means it's baked in a large rectangle and cut off for individual consumption.  I had one with roasted pears and holy hell was it delicious.

So, if you like delicious pizza and a soundtrack based on a Das Efx pandora station, this is the place for you.  Oh and make sure to leave room for the fried pizza dough.  You can thank me later.",2014-02-27 19:00:12,"{'food': ['pizza', 'roasted pears'], 'drink': []}"

I thought if he loves the place then it has to be good.  Granted, we did go at an off time 3PM which is between lunch and dinner so what I have to report may be influenced by not being on their regular meal schedule and their prep may not be as good at this time.

The ambiance is not anything wowing, but it is clean and bright with photos from Greece on the wall depicting what most Americans think of when they think of Greece, very old buildings that were built to last the test of time.

My meal was just so-so.  I wouldn't say it was bad, just that it lacked the flare I was expecting.  The stewed veggies were delicious.  The chicken, rice, and hummus were average.  The gyro meat my partner ordered looked a bit dark and oily, which may be because it hadn't been ordered in a while and he was getting the outer part of the meat that cooks on the skewer.

The service is what made me give them a 2 star instead of a 3.  Our server was a young guy.  It was difficult to hear what he was saying because he ran words together and mumbled.  This guy might have been Greek, but I'm pretty sure he was at least 3rd generation American.  We had to repeat what we were reading directly off the menu several times for him to get it.  We both ordered drinks, neither of which showed before or during the meal.  I would have brought this up, but we had water and the ordering was so poor I didn't want to have the interaction again.  

Now the dessert, that's another story...the baklava was amazing, good sized portion, and the honey on top was sublime.  We also got the peach gelato which comes in a frozen peach.  It was also delicious.  After the first bite, my eyes widened as I looked at my partner with excitement.  I would definitely go there again, just for dessert after eating somewhere else in that Fairmount area.  The service did get better for dessert as a woman took charge of our table, which leads me to believe it was the end of the guy's shift.  She did notice that my partner had ordered a coffee later and asked if he wanted it with dessert.  I did not see the first guy anytime after dessert and he probably left.

Finally, hours later, both my partner and I had higher stomach acid issues, not severe, but enough to make me not want to return for a full meal.

The choices were very burrito-heavy and I just don't feel right going out and paying $10 + tip for a burrito when I can get a $6 burrito at Chipotle that will be way more delicious. Then my focus settled on the short rib. Something just felt right about this. My bartender informed me that it was BIG. I ordered and before I knew it, a giant short rib along with texas toast and pickles was in front of me. The meat fell off the bone into glorious shreds which I shoveled down. The flavor was good and there were only a few chewy parts. I'm kind of a picky meat eater, but on this night all that remained was the bone.

I complimented this giant piece of animal with chips and guac and a margarita. The guac was pretty generic, not a lot of character but it was plentiful and the chips were fresh. The margarita was fine for $5. 

Judging by some of these other yelps, maybe this was just a lucky good first impression but I will note that I also sat at the bar.

I had been looking forward to the opening of this restaurant ever since I heard about it, since we absolutely love Blue Hill at Stone Barns, but I was a tad hesitant about dining there so soon after they opened because most restaurants usually need a few weeks to ""iron out the kinks.""  F & F was the exception!  Every single aspect of our meal from the moment we walked in the door until we left was perfectly executed.  

The dining room was beautifully decorated and felt like a quaint neighborhood restaurant, without giving you the feeling of being the third wheel to the couple dinining at the next table over.  

We started with the sunchoke soup to share, which was excellent.  The roasted farro in the soup added a suprising crunch, while its nutty flavor complimented the sunchoke well.  

The winter vegetable salad with homemade cottage cheese was also spot-on.  For the entree, while I usually never order chicken at a restaurant, I sprang for it this time, and I was very happy I did.  

My husband ordered the pancetta-wrapped farm egg and the spot pig for his entree.  While I did not taste either of these dishes, he could not stop raving about them.  

The courses were timed perfectly and it was so nice not to feel rushed through our dinner.  The owner was so hospitable and even offered to take us to meet the chef following our meal, which was such a special birthday treat for my husband.  

We will definitely be going back.",2011-03-22 15:17:31,"{'food': ['sunchoke soup', 'winter vegetable salad', 'pancetta-wrapped farm egg', 'spot pig'], 'drink': []}"

This neighborhood needs some variety! I'm really hoping they can pull together the service and the food in the next few months. 

I'll second a lot of the reviews already posted but seems our experience was not quite as bad as some. We went on a Saturday afternoon right about lunch time with a friend so it was busy but there was a table for three and we were seated promptly.  The hostess seemed quite unfriendly but our server was all smiles but she would disappear for long periods. We did receive water and menus right away.  Most other pho places the food comes out in 10 minutes, we waited about 20 minutes so not as long as others have commented on. Two of us ordered bun with spring roll and neither got the spring roll.  We managed to finally get the hostess' attention (no idea where our server went) and she did bring out spring rolls for us, seemed she started pitching in when things got really busy.  No one came around to ask how things were after the spring roll correction.  It's not that big of a place compared to most Vietnamese spots around town so I would expect better service. They clearly need more help and more seasoned wait staff.  

We did see a few people walk out when no one came to greet them after a while.  That's just not good business. We never got our check, couldn't find our server, or manage to flag anyone down. We had to go up to the register to pay after waiting about 20 minutes (which incidentally is how most pho restaurants operate).

To the owners of iPho, if you are reading this, the neighborhood would very much like you to succeed.  Here's a few suggestions that might help:  

1) move the register to the front so that a staff person (or two) is always there to greet customers and make more space in the front for waiting customers and takeout orders.  You can move some tables closer to the kitchen once you move the register from the back. 

2) have customers pay at register when leaving like other pho restaurants

3) bring take out orders to the front at the relocated register so people can get in and out fast. 

4) hire a few more seasoned servers and work with the kitchen to get the timing down. People expect pho to be a meal served quickly!

For the restaurant, it is their responsibility to provide good service, a good environment, and of course, good food. For the dinner-goer, he or she must make their own judgment calls about what to order and why. I had it on good authority that these were some of the best margaritas in the city. I came ready to get my drank on. 

I made a mistake, though. I ordered a frozen margarita, which I later learned is made in a standard blender. It was the most bland margarita I've ever ordered. When you order it regular, non-frozen, you got 2-3 margarita's worth, in a big tumbler they leave at your table. Mine came in a small glass, with less alcohol and less drink than everyone around me. 

I'll be the first to admit: I made a giant mistake. However, I asked our waitress not once, but twice, if their frozen margaritas were good. She assured me they were delicious, but said it distractedly as she was saying something to another waiter, or as she was checking on another table. It was a busy Friday night, and I understand that she was covering a large section of the restaurant. Still, I wish that she had told me upfront how disappointing the frozen margs were: large chucks of ice not blended, watery. I felt like real sassy about it. 

The nachos we ordered were good, but sloppily made. Now, maybe I've been spoiled by El Vez and their black bean nachos, but for the price, they could have been made with a little more attention - and toppings, for that matter. I'll shoulder some of the responsibility with our poor experience at Copabanana, but I wish our waitress had taken more time to point us in the right direction.

Really really really good cooking, with a cool dining room, central location, friendly staff... And did I mention the really good cooking?  The kitchen is disciplined and skilled in making every dish have a perfect balance of flavors, with brightness and 'pop' and some real depth, paired with a range of textures.  Such an enjoyable experience - I went twice last week, and was oh so tempted to go again Monday night.

The 'raw beef' dish. Oh my.  I want more. Soooo good.  Tender substantive cuts of, you guessed it, raw beef, with tiny pops of crunch of quinoa, with a generous dollop of sauce gribiche.  This lovely green, creamy, salty-but-not-too-salty perfection of a sauce.  Just give me a squeeze bottle of the stuff, I want to guzzle it down, and put it on everything!  I had to pull out the Larousse to remind myself what the hell this was.  Aldine puréed theirs, rather than the classic emulsion, and I swear they added some other herbs (basil, mint??), in addition to the classic ingredients.  I haven't had a sauce linger on my mind, like this, for a long time.

The second dish that stands out was their onion soup.  Such a simple dish, I almost skipped it.  Thankfully, I didn't.  Clean, unencumbered, it had such depth of flavor, savoriness, richness - it was remarkable.  I hope that goes onto the regular menu.  Try it, much better than the cheezy crap of a mess you'll get at Parc.

The chef has a real talent for citrus.  He blends it into his dish seamlessly.  Great examples were the cauliflower with truffle, orange and hazelnut.  And the crudo.  Well-executed dishes.

Also had the pork belly with squid and mint and crisps of black rice; the breast of duck with cabbage and quince; and the skate with clams and brown butter.  All excellent.  Though I would put the duck on top, and the skate on the bottom, the latter not being as well integrated of a dish as everything else at Aldine.  The duck was perfectly cooked and portioned generously.  I would order the duck again in a heartbeat.  Next time I have to try the steak with tendon.

The food is very good, so they obviously know what they're doing. The one thing they don't get right is, the ribs are not hot. (I've had them three times, they haven't been hot once.) They taste great, they fall off the bone when poked with even a plastic fork, and they're not slathered with so much overly-sweet sauce that they make me gag, like Sweet Lucy's (which, by the way, is to BBQ as Rustler was to steak houses) - but they're not hot. 

The mac and cheese was very good -- nice, crispy topping, just moist enough. Again: Not hot. Warm-ish. How about it, fellas? Microwave? Steam table?

I'm quite partial to the cole slaw, which is (again) not overly sweet and gloppy, as it is in so many places. It's got some kind of subtle flavor I can't place, but I really like it.

Someone complained about the small piece of cornbread. It IS small, and tasty. Personally, I don't want to fill up on bread, so this was plenty for me. YMMV.

Finally, since I don't drink beer, I'm happy that they have quality iced tea (my preferred beverage). I will note for the people who do that you can get a custom six-pack, which I know people like.

This is a small, homey place (good luck on getting a seat for a single person at a peak time, unless you like sitting on a barstool at a counter) with a few outdoor tables. (I'd love to sit outside, but it's hot out there and they don't have umbrellas!)

Oh, and easy on-street parking -- always a plus.

On the whole, very happy with the place. I look forward to them working out the kinks and taking it to the next level.",2015-06-21 14:15:41,"{'food': ['pizza', 'mac and cheese', 'cole slaw', 'cornbread'], 'drink': ['iced tea']}"

The first time I visited this location I ordered a cortado/gibraltar, excited since I hadn't had La Colombe in a year and a half, and I was feeling nostalgic. I already knew something looked wrong from the darker color of the coffee swirled in the milk. It was burnt (yes i know the color of the crema doesnt matter but it does matter if it normally is lighter and the same coffee) I drank it, but I didn't enjoy it. I probably should've said something, but alas I didn't and checked it off as a bad one-off... 

A few weeks later (a month maybe?) I return to the same location and decide to order an espresso. The Nizza once again. Giving it another chance to redeem itself. The barista started talking to me, asking me questions, trying to have a conversation while he was pulling the shot, maybe that's what killed it. I took my coffee and sat down with the rest of my party already having noticed that the ""crema"" was very dark, not a definite sign of ""burnt"" but i could smell it. One other person in my group also had his coffee (their regular drip) burnt as well. Even less drinkable than mine. To the point where he, a person who basically never takes anything back, took it back (which they did when they smelled it and realized it was really burnt). I had already chugged half of mine so i decided to stomach it again... 

Maybe they're fazing out their Nizza? And I should try their new single origin? Next time I will. Stick to the craft coffee my friends...

This confusion extends to the kitchen, wherein the recent chef switcheroo of Michael Stevenson for Leo Forneas has led to the restaurant's refocus from the pure Southern bourbon and blues motif that previously and not very successfully defined them since opening a few years ago.

On a normal day, this would be enough in itself, but I chose to visit during Mother's Day, pretty much the worst day for dining out, especially when you're part of a party of eight. So the service, while not bad, per se, gets a pass. What doesn't get a pass is the prix fixe menu from which we were forced to order. The menu consisted of literally every item of their normal brunch menu, plus a couple of desserts, for a significantly higher price than normal. So say you wanted to order the salad and buttermilk chicken sandwich - $15 on a normal Sunday. $35 on Mother's Day. But you got a choice of beignets or panna cotta for dessert, so I'm sure that warranted the extra markup. Needless to say, I made it a priority to choose the absolute most expensive things on their normal brunch menu.

Another problem with just throwing your entire menu onto a prix fixe is portion sizes. My tuna tartare was simply mixed with the occasional sliced cornichon and served alongside a few potato chips, but it was fresh and a good size to prime to palate for the rest of the meal. Some of my fellow diners got the pigs in a blanket, which were nearly a main course in themselves. After plowing through a few of them, multiple people remarked at how full they were getting, and the main course hadn't even arrived yet. 

The Maryland Crab cake eggs benedict isn't what you'd expect to find in a Southern-slanted restaurant, but I'm glad it's here, because the crab cakes were almost all crab, and went really well with the eggs (poached well for me, though others weren't so lucky), mustard hollandaise, and English muffin. Serving them alongside french fries seemed like they just didn't want to take the time to prepare an additional starch, and I didn't want to take the time to eat the underwhelming slices of potato. 

Fried dough is an easy crowd pleaser, and the beignets hit the spot, even if they were still a little doughy. The gluten-free diner amongst us described her panna cotta as ""interesting,"" and not in a good way, though she seemed unfamiliar with the dish. 

To be honest, the combination of food and company provided an overall positive experience at Twisted Tail, though there were enough missteps to not make it a priority to return. Regardless of the good service from our server, and the great service from the managers in seating us in what must have been a hellish time for them, the food still needs a little bit of refinement.",2013-05-14 20:47:57,

They also had a good menu in the way of coffee and other drinks and some nicer options for sandwiches, salads, and the like. I ordered a café au lait with almond milk and a plain bagel with Earth Balance. The au lait was tasty and not too pricey even with the almond milk. The bagel order came out a little bit differently than what I had ordered- I got an everything bagel with cream cheese. I'm not usually one to speak up about that kind of thing, having been on the other end of things at the café where I work, and my shyness coupled with all of the friendliness I had already experienced from the staff led me to let it go.

When I used to live in Philly we'd go often. Then after I moved to NJ we would make the trip maybe once or twice a year to Philly and choose Pagoda for dinner. The owners recognized us and had fantastic service and food. (See previous review) 

We were in town for the auto show and had decided to return to Pagoda.  After a long day on our feet we were glad to sit down somewhere familiar.  We were seated immediately,  put in our order by a somewhat hurried waiter. A few minutes later the waiter came back and barked out ""no more Peking duck"". That was a disappointment on a Saturday evening not too late at night that one of their specialties was not available. We did have shrimp dumplings which were decent;  my garden vegetable udon noodle soup & his shrimp dumpling udon noodle soup which were as good as we remembered. We got the orange chicken not spicy as our shared entree which was average but nothing special. During this time we also heard a little girl crying loudly for 10 minutes until one of the owners I presume grabbed her hard by the arm yelling at her and taking her to another room to yell at her / hit her. It echoed through the restaurant. We did not want dessert. Left a 15% tip and while my husband was in the restroom I heard the waiter say to a girl behind the counter ""extremely cheap""
Now I don't know if I heard correctly but that was pretty ballsy. Especially since we tried the Peking duck rolls which were microwaved rolls with warm lettuce and bits of duck. Basically inedible. They charged $6 which we didn't dispute. We have no problem tipping well but he did not earn more than 15% - especially given what he said. Oh well Pagoda you lose our business to the Peking Duck House in North Brunswick which is only 20 minutes from us.

I had the Saigon which is like a banh mi but with a hot dog instead of compressed pig's ears. Come to think of it that may not be all that much different. The greens on the Saigon were super crisp and fresh and the fries were awesome. They could use less salt though.

A few suggestions:

1) They have dogs from all over the world but no Philly dog?
2) When you walk in the first thing you see is the posting for the Bronx Bomber. Now I'm from New York originally but I'd rather not see a dog named for the NY Yankees right when I walk into the place, in Philly.
3) The menu drawings for each item are cool but you can't see the ones in the back. Hopefully they'll add a menu on the wall to the left to look at if you are in line.
4) They put aluminum foil on the grill to cook the dogs. Heresy! I grew up near the original Nathan's. One of the reasons Nathan's hot dogs taste so good is that the grill gets seasoned with all the dogs cooking all day. I know the foil thing is cleaner but seriously, if I was that interested in cleanliness why would I be eating hot dogs in the first place?

The beans came alone at the beginning with nothing but a spoon. I understand bringing food as it's ready...I actually appreciate it. But why on earth would I want a bowl of refried beans without anything to eat them with? When the food came they brought me the wrong quesadilla. The employee, without apology, took it back to get me the right one. I then sat for 8+ minutes without food. When the employee  finally brought the food I asked for the chips for the beans. I was told that I was wrong - it doesn't come that way. I replied ""well, could I get some chips?"" I was directed to go stand in line again to order them myself. I told the employee that I thought maybe, as an apology for making me wait so long for the correct food, he could just bring us some chips. The response I got was a blank stare and him walking away without a word. As I left I asked another employee if that person, in their pink windbreaker, was a manager. I was then informed that he infact was the manager. It's shocking that this person, with their inability to provide even a modicum of hospitality, is your manager on duty.

The food at Kanella isn't bad, for what it is. I can't say whether it is authentic Cypriot cuisine. It's nothing like mainland Greek cuisine. I can say for sure at least from a Northern Greek perspective, there are better options in the city in this price range. Try Estia.

Jones intrigued me for quite some time -- the storefront seemingly standing out whenever I'd walk by it. Finally, last Sunday, a friend and I decided to stop in for a late brunch. We saw people waiting outside, but since we were a small party, we were quickly seated.

I had a perfect view of the kitchen from my chair. It was a curse. Despite the fact that we had been seated just three minutes before and hadn't even ordered yet, I wanted my food that instant. I don't think I've ever been as impatient at a restaurant than I was at Jones. It's amazing my friend didn't hurt her neck considering how many times I urged her to turn around/strain to look at plates being produced behind her.

We decided to have a sober brunch, so I started with a Jones cream soda -- mostly because of the irony and the fact that I didn't think I had one since I was 13. Still good stuff.

For entrees, my friend got the meatless cheese sandwich and ate every bite. She loved it. I got the fried chicken and fries basket, and despite a truly valiant effort, it looked like I didn't take a bite by the time I was finished with it.

At $11, though, for three average-size meatballs? I thought that was a bit high. A sea scallop appetizer was quite good also, but at $15 for just two scallops, that was a bit high. Some bread accompanying it would've been nice. A small dollop of spaghetti with rock shrimp and a two cooked slices of cappacolle (gobagool?) in a spicy tomato and squid ink sauce looked disgusting on the plate, but was delicious.

Now to the cheese selection.  I may not love beer and wine, but I do love cheese.  We selected three bruschetta: goat cheese & pesto, ricotta with honey and pistachio, and classic caprese.  What great combinations of flavors, I wish I could replicate them in my own kitchen.  We also ordered a the asparagus and white bean salad; it was huge and light, great for summer.

So after 15 minutes of waiting...I got my food.

I have never been treated this way at ANY fast food place even. No one apologized.

 I ordered the Cyprus Breakfast and my companion ordered the Malawa. We shared the dishes. I was totally amazed! The Cyprus Breakfast was simple, the flavors all complemented the ingredients. When you ate it all together, the was a party in your mouth. You feel compelled to just close your eyes and enjoy what is in your palette. Gosh! Writing about my experience is just taking me back!

I've been traveling, so this was the first Night Market I've made since Chinatown last year.  Got there early, 6-ish, to try to beat the inevitable lines.  The traffic heading down Pine St was a disaster (whether due to South Street being closed, the Eagles game, or maybe it always is at rush hour).  I tried to park in that big indoor lot on Lombard between 2nd & 3rd, but it was full (did find one of the last spaces across the street, TG).

Getting to Night Market early is definitely a good plan, since after an hour the lines start to get really long for the best trucks.  But went with the flow and had a great time anyway.

Award for longest lines (too long to wait in): A tie between Cheu Noodle Bar (presumably for those killer wings), and the Surf and Turf Truck (lobster rolls).

Highlight of the night: Chatting with Marc Vetri as he sweated for his money at the Alla Spina tent (see photo).  Pretty good Sangria, Marc!

Also tried:

FOO TRUCK'S roast pork bahn mi crostini--perhaps the best thing all evening

FREECON FARMS' Crabby Granny cider--a nice big refreshing glass

LITTLE BABY'S ICE CREAM for peanut butter, maple, tarragon ice cream--Yum!

POI DOG SNACK SHOP for an authentic Hawaiian spam musubi (why Haiwaii consumes 80% of the world's SPAM supply!)

Starters: 
The deviled eggs were just as good as the ones Mom makes for thanksgiving. wonderful presentation too. I actually didn't want to sip my water for fear of losing the taste in my mouth.
The fried pickles were delicious and crispy. not soggy at all. perfectly done.
Mains: 
The village burger was PERFECT. Juicy, thick, good temp. just Perfect. It's so hard to find a burger like this in New York.
The Pork Sammy was just as fine quality as your ""Dino BBQ"" or your Nyc BBQ scene. Fresh and we'll flavored pork that wasn't the least bit dry at all. Very well done.
Sides:
Duck fat fries with cheese sauce.......    YAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!
Dessert:
Vanilla Bourbon shake had the perfect thickness to it, but you can still taste the Makers. Simply wonderful.
Alcohol:
The punch was as good as it sounded. No one flavor surpassed the other. a perfect balance.
The commodore had a nice kick with a citrusy flavor. Goes  hand on hand with the shake.
The overall selection of booze is as wide as the the bar itself. More whiskey choices than we've seen in a long time.
Staff: Kenny and Valerie were knowledgeable and attentive. Always checking on us and always there to service plates or answer questions. Fantastic bartenders on a busy Friday night.
Overall: Will come back again. If you're visiting The city of brotherly love, you CANNOT skip this little piece of wonderment. Excellent job Whiskey Village. Keep it up.

I only get these cravings about three times a year.  This is a full commitment meal.  I didn't have breakfast or lunch so I knew I could consume the calories. 

The bourbon choices are plentiful. The scotch menu was equally as impressive. 

To start,  the fried pickles looked like a good idea. Most fried pickles are thinly sliced.   I was eager to see Jose's interpretation.  They came out larger than most I've seen. The only time I have seen anything similar was in Denver at biker Jim's hot dog restaurant where they are fried in the whole slices.   These were not extraordinary but they were tasty nonetheless and well worth the calories.  

 For my burger, I ordered the 8 ounce and I added the jalapeno bacon, the cheddar and a fried egg. 

The first thing I noticed was that my egg was slightly over cooked. i expect my burger eggs to have runny yokes. This one was solid. The burger itself, which I ordered to be cooked to medium was also just slightly over cooked -- no pink anywhere. 

Lastly the duck fat fries rounded out the meal.

Overall my burger tasted incredibly good. It probably is the second best burger that I've had... My recently reviewed burger from Vegas was just a little better due to the slight carelessness of the chef tonight with my the temperature on my burger and egg. 

Ur was juicy and flavorful.  It was very fresh, which is am odd way to describe a burger.  Think McDonald's and then it's COMPLETE OPPOSITE.  :-)

The classic Penang Pad Thai will give you strips of tofu, shrimp and squid added to the classic egg noddles and peanut sauce. However, I'd advise starting with the chicken (comes with tofu, as well) or just tofu Pad Thai. 

In addition, they give you pickled beans sprouts in a sweet sauce to eat separately or, as I do, dump on top of the dish. Adding the sprouts elevates the Pad Thai to a whole new experience.

I can tell you from experience that the packaging method they use (plastic dish containers, closed paper bag) keep things hot for a good hour after taking out. I pick up and drive home, place the dishes in the microwave until my boo is home and things are still hot and ready.

Lastly, Penang charges you little for great quality food. I pay under $20 for two heaping dishes of Pad Thai (used to paying about $25 at other establishments).",2015-09-13 14:22:59,"{'food': ['Pad Thai', 'Chicken Pad Thai'], 'drink': []}"

Really good food that sticks to your bones and fills you up in a flavorful way.  
I had the Popcorn Shrimp the Pork Sammy and those excellent Duck Fries that are nice and crispy.  
The pork was perfect with the fried pickles and that slaw just cut the taste perfectly...
Look here...if you are looking for a nice bite and reasonable prices for that area of the city I suggest it strongly.

It was very busy but not unpleasantly packed.The cocktail menu is amazing. Their menu is pasted into pages of old children's books.The one I got was ""What Is a Stranger and What Should I Do?"" which was wonderfully creepy.  My bartender Kate was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.She started me with ""The Hemingway"" rum cocktail-it was sweet and refreshing. Because so many of the drinks sounded tantalizing on the menu I decided to switch it up to the ""Branch Cosmo"" for my next drink.It was such a refreshing change from the saccharine sweet that you have come to expect from your typical cosmo.Fresh cranberries and orange were muddled into the Tito's vodka.It was delicious.Both the Hemingway and the Cosmo were made with all fresh ingredients and were both balanced and stiff. They tasted the way a beautiful spring day feels.

There was a shift change and Brendon took over on bartending duties.I noticed it was still happy hour so I figured I would take advantage of the specials and order an Old Fashioned.It was easily the best Old Fashioned I had ever had in my life. I can definitely see myself going back to Bourbon & Branch for many many more of these.

The cocktail prices might have seemed a little expensive at first glance but they were all WELL worth the price.

By this time I realized I was pretty hungry so I decided to order some food.
The Irish nachos appetizer was awesome and more than affordably priced.It was ample enough for 3-4 people to eat. Since it was just me,there were PLENTY of leftovers.

We sit in the back of the bar and raise a hand to make a drinking gesture to the waiter that, in a different context, could land us in the back of a cop car. We make the gesture with such accuracy, and with such ridiculous beauty that the server surely knows to bring over a Jack and Coke without ever hearing a single word.

We await the arrival of our drink, in such an astounding fashion that my drinking buddies share the anguish and dire thirst. They wait too, looking around the room for the server to return. When he does, he douses the blue hoodie in Jack Daniels, stripping it of its perfect nature. The drink is too strong and garnished with a lemon. 

He does not look like a professional, like he never saw the inside of a bar prior to that moment. Patrons stop and stare at the spill. He walks away without ever saying a word. Later, he bumps into me and gets ketchup on the back of the tarnished hoodie. After continually ignoring my perfect requests for another drink and telling me to wait, he finally brings a second Jack and Coke. This one is devoid of liquor. He spills it on my hoodie, pants, and hand. Again, he walks away without ever saying a word. I sit and shake my head, gasping. No one has ever seen anything quite like it.

Two bad experiences in particular stick out. First, a weekend brunch where my table was forgotten entirely for almost half an hour. We were just about to leave without ordering when I overheard two waiters asking each other which one of them was responsible for our table. One came over in a panic and asked if we'd been served yet. When we complained about the wait, the server was very apologetic and offered us a round of free drinks. This helped, but I was still kind of annoyed because they weren't particularly busy at the time (several empty tables around us). 

Then a dinner a month or two later,  when we made a reservation and still had to wait about 20 minutes. We actually ended up waiting even longer than that because they wanted to seat us directly next to the bar area, where there was a big crowd making a lot of noise thanks to some bar crawl going on, so we asked to wait for a better seat. But that wasn't really their fault- I just wish the bar was better separated from the restaurant. During our meal, the waitress knocked over my water glass and sloshed my soup onto the table. She cleaned it up, but did not offer to bring a new bowl. I was also given the wrong drink order and my dining companion was served the wrong entree. Our server aplogized for all these mistakes, but she seemed generally distracted throughout the entire meal.

My girlfriend and I showed up Friday night, put our names in and gave our number to the host to be texted in roughly 50 minutes. No problem...unless of course that system breaks down!  I never want to be ""that person"" to constantly bother a host about how much longer to wait, but after 50 minutes I politely asked how much longer. We were told we were 2 down the list and it would be maybe 5 or 10 minutes longer. After 30 more minutes and noticing several people being seated that showed up well after us I once again politely asked where we stood in line. She looked at the ipad and told me, ""I texted you 20 minutes ago, you never replied."" We were standing at the bar about 15 feet from her for about 45 minutes of the wait and never got a text. How do you not pay attention to that detail? We were seated, but I could not get over what happened. Not only did the text message not come through, but we felt like there was no accountability and the host made it feel like it was our fault!

It never seems particularly busy (which is the only reason I have never tried the sushi / sashimi) but given the freshness of the ingredients used in their standard Chinese fare, I am about to give that a try.  Though I sometimes take out, I really prefer eating in, because the dishes I prefer here (Orange Flavor Beef and Sauteed Pan Fried Beef) are SO crispy, travel would spoil the experience.  I usually NEVER order beef in Oriental restaurants (except Korean) because it is inevitably the cheapest round money can buy.  Little kitchen EXCELS at beef, though my chicken dishes have always been quite good as well.

I don't know why this was listed as ""Thai"" other than they have Pad Thai on the menu. This is really standard Chinese, though the chef is very competent at Bento boxes, and some Indonesian style curry, and stuff like Roti Canai.  


What impresses me is when I taste fresh cilantro, real garlic slivers, real scallions and fresh broccoli, bell peppers, etc. in a $10-12 dish.  There is real attention to detail here, and crispy stuff is crispy, and soft stuff is soft.  Food is served PIPING hot.  Service is very friendly, and English is well-understood (though they seem very happy to accommodate attempts at broken Mandarin.)  

Portions are so big that two people can easily split an app and a single entree and leave satisfied. Maybe it helps to be recognized as a regular, but I have never been dissatisfied with a meal, and I've eaten at Yang Ming, San Kee, Suzanna Foo, Han Dynasty, and dropped a lot more $$$ and left less happy.

The only complaint I have is that when I order something ""extra spicy"" there may be an extra dried red and slice of jalapeno tossed in.  I suspect the chef does not want to offend Western palates.

Anyway, I have eaten in all the oriental restaurants on the Main Line and MOST of the well-know ones in Chinatown and S. Philly and I still come here at least once per month.  Maybe I've been lucky with the dishes I've chosen, but I am ready to start checking out some of the less obvious ones.

The zucchini strand pasta I had there made me run the other way whenever anyone suggested going there for food.  That was 2009.  This is 2012 and I have broken my vow - three times already.  

Intending to walk in somewhere for brunch Mother's Day weekend, my family seriously miscalculated our chances of getting a table anywhere.  Constructively turned away from Day by Day, my dad ducked into Slate down the block.  No Dad! Don't do it, you don't know what you're asking for!  No wait for brunch? Damn.  Begrudgingly, I went in.  Hmm, the brunch menu looked surprisingly good, and affordable.  Interesting.  Still skeptical, I ordered a crab and bacon frittata and waited nervously.  The food took its time coming out (the place seemed very under-staffed), but I was shocked to find that the food was actually worth the wait.  My frittata was probably 9 inches in diameter and had plenty of good crab and bacon flavor.  It came with a nicely dressed side salad that barely squeezed itself on to the plate.  My parents wanted an order of eggs and sausage, which they don't have.  So the waitress had them order the two eggs and sides and the bangers and mash (you get both sausage and eggs).  Not exactly what my parents had in mind, but when it came out, it was more than enough food for 3 people and they actually loved it.  

Because of the great brunch experience, my fiance and I have gone back for dinner a couple times. The crab cake is big and meaty, enough for a very light dinner.  The mussels are delicious and brothy, with the bits of chorizo on top (also big enough for a light dinner).  Their salmon entree is perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and cooked to order, accompanied by a decadently rich mash.  We also enjoyed their fish special one week, tilapia filet in a wine sauce topped with shrimp and scallops - lots of shrimp and scallops.  

My only criticism of this place is the wait.  It can take a little longer than other restaurants for the kitchen to churn out the food.  The waitress said they have a very small kitchen, so maybe it can't be remedied with more waitstaff.  We also weren't fans of the old fashioned that we ordered.  There was a lot of pummeled fruit in the glass, rye, and not much of anything else - not your typical old fashioned recipe.  But overall, I am a new convert when it comes to Slate.

The hubby and I finally made it out on a Saturday nite and found the restaurant to be busy but not crowded. It was warm for the end of winter (75 degrees that day) and the windows were opened to allow a slight breeze to blow. It was lovely. 

We started with the seafood salad and it was a very ""healthy"" serving. That, along with the delish buttered, garlic and oldbay rolls they serve could have been a meal by itself..Tri color rotini pasta, shrimp and imitation crab, celery and seasonings mixed with a creamy parmesan dressing. Lemme tell ya, it was the bee's knees!

Then onto dinner...I was undecided between the fried whiting and the stuffed turkey chops (spinach, cheese, roasted red peppers, mushroom gravy) so I convinced the dude to order the turkey chops so I could sample both..Yeah, greedy I know- so what!

We couldn't have been happier with the meal. Both came accompanied by two sides: corn, roasted potatoes, sauteed broccoli, orange rice. I think you could get mac-n-cheese or collards for an additional cost but we didn't order either this time. I was on the fence about ordering the cherry iced tea but it was on point. 

The meal came to about $40 - not too shabby, eh? With our $25 Restaurant.com gift certificate, we only had to pay $15 + tip, right??? WRONG! Little did we know that they no longer accepted Restaurant.com gift certs and when we explained this to our server, she pointed to a sign that was 8 1/2 x 11 (Landscape view) on a podium in the corner that read ""We no longer accept Restaurant.com coupons"". Are you serious?? I came here to eat not read little posters so I surely didn't notice that throughout the entire dinner. The hubby didn't either because the big screen TV's were blasting the NCAA game and he barely paid ME any attention, so the sign didn't stand a chance!

Al in all, the server gave us a 20% discount on the bill (not a lot of help when you expect to pay $15). That was the best she could do but you'd best believe that I contacted Restaurant.com as soon as I got home and got a replacement  cert. According to Sole II Soul, they cancelled their contract with Restaurant.com but the website continues to sell their certificates.. So BUYER BEWARE!!

All in all, I had a good time. Yeah, I left with the figurative ""bad taste in my mouth"". Even though they could've had better signage or more notice before we ordered AND devoured such a delicious, savory meal that we were actually going to have to pay for it - the service, food and atmosphere couldn't be beat.

I got to know all of the baristas there because I spent nearly every day there, working on my grad thesis.  They're pretty awesome because they usually know what I'm going to have before I get to the front of the line.

Their coffee is outstanding and somewhat addictive, to the point that if I'm out of town I refuse to drink coffee.  It has a really rich flavor, and they brew it to perfection.  As someone noted earlier, their lattes can be on the lukewarm side, so if you like things piping hot, tell them to make it ""extra hot"" and they're more than happy to oblige.

Although people find their lack of menu intimidating, the baristas are more than happy to tell you what they have available.  Basically, it's anything coffee-related, but don't ask for flavors or crazy milk.  They don't have it.  They have bittersweet molten chocolate that they use to make hot cocoa and mochas-- yum!  They usually have a great selection of pastries and goodies-- try the tarts or a croissant; they are all really delicious.

One of the drawbacks of the place is that they don't have wifi or a ton of electrical outlets for computers.  That is a blessing in disguise for me, because I get very distracted by procrastinating on the web, so I purposely go there to work because I know I'll sit there and write rather than checking my email every few minutes.

After ordering they serve you five side dishes, that compliment the meal perfectly. Instead of trying to flag your server down, there is a button on the table that you ring if you need them.

This is by far my favorite generic center city deli.  First off, they have some really innovative sandwich constructions.

Also, bagel chips while you wait (lines are long but move fast) and prices are somehow always below what's quoted on the board.  I don't really understand their discounting, but I'm not complaining...
