Food is amazing, they have baked pizzas that's really tasty and cool, their cooler drinks are tasty, snackers lip smacking.

Frio Bistro,Akanksha Jain,"Ambience- 4
Food- 4.5
Service- 3
Value for money- 4.5

Came here for a quick lunch.
Ordered mezze platter, wild mushroom fricassee and peach iced tea.
Hummus tasted good but the pita bread was a little hard.
The pasta was heavenly. Perfectly cooked pasta and lots of mushroom with an amazing sauce.
Iced tea tasted nice but was a little too sweet. Make sure you mention it to them if you’re not a fan of super sweet drinks.

Could improve on the service bit, the staff is a little slow and less responsive even when it isn’t crowded.

5/5 in terms of value if you’re a gold member.

Frio Bistro,Varun K,"Wonderful restaurant! Absolutely fabulous food!

Ambience: very nice and comfy... Doesn't feel rushed which is particularly important for this kind of place.

Food: every morsel is heavenly! They nailed both veg and non veg dishes which is a rarity in itself... Loved the pizzas, the fish and chips is a must order, the penne Alfredo is pretty good too... As is the spicy crispy chicken leg dish.... Absolutely delicious! Mushroom soup was very nice too.... minestrone was average.... Couldn't try the desserts because there's only so much a person can have lol...

P.S. - they do have a bar but no Bira.

Service - polite. But you must be patient. Food preparation takes time. If you reach post 9:30pm, you will be expected to order your entire meal in one shot itself.

VFM - it's an expensive bistro but the chef deserves it. He's absolutely spot on with the flavours. I would strongly recommend this restaurant.

Frio Bistro,Leena Gupta,"This is one of the poor Italian restaurants in Hyderabad. The first giveaway was the menu cards. They were all torn and faded. Few of them even had the spiral binding missing in places.
The chairs and table cloth evinced that the restaurant was not very well maintained.

Coming to the food, I can say that it was very disappointing. We had ordered -
•Chicken Wings
•Tangy Arrabita Pasta
•Farmer's Ortalano
•Tiramisu

▪︎The chicken wings were marketed as a spicy dish but the spice was no where to be felt. Also, the wings were glazed in two different sauces though they both tasted the same - Sweet and heavy.
▪︎The red sauce of the pasta was diluted .It was done to such an extent that the sauce was not willing stay with the penne pasta.
▪︎The pizza was the first relief, though it wasn't as it as some of the other restaurants. It was thin and it retained its shape.
▪︎The tiramisu was a disaster. The cream was spoilt and the whole desert tasted sour. We had to send it back.

Finally, the service. The service was one of the very few worthwhile experience.

All in all, I will not visit this restaurant again and a do not recommend it to anyone.",2,"1 Review , 1 Follower",4/30/2019 19:25,0,,"{'food': ['Chicken Wings', 'Tangy Arrabita Pasta', ""Farmer's Ortalano"", 'Tiramisu'], 'drink': []}"

We availed zomato gold offer but as we did not inform them before placing the order, initially they were very reluctant to accept as we need to inform them well in advance before placing the order.

The ambience was good , but disappointed with the service. There was long delay for serving the food, no proper attention to the customer requirements was the key disappointment factor.

Coming to main topic the food Pizza was great but it was a mixed feel for pork ribs as I always like my meat to be spicy but the barbequed sauce was little sweet not to my liking.

so with my limited knowledge of consistency of meat the overall all food served was good.

But it's not a place for people like me who is more into spiciness.

Visited this place for dinner yesterday night. I would say first visit was very nice. Pretty empty when we reached but later the restaurant got occupied .

Frio Bistro,Sheeny Yadav,"Frio is set in a dark toned theme with black walls and complementing prismic mirrors with dim lighting to set mood for a quiet, interesting evening conversation.
The music is contemporary and thankfully not too loud. It moulds into the environment without intruding into your private space.
Service was fine. We had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us, but were courteous and friendly.
Here is what we ordered:
100% arabica cold coffee - basic and just right. Creamy and not too sugary.
Dark chocolate shake - absolute yum and sinful. It tastes exactly as you would want it to. The only ask - since it's categorized as thickshake, it should be thicker, but I guess that's the case with shakes served anywhere in the city.
Chicken ala plancha - Sheer dissapointment, especially given that it was in chef's special menu. It was as ordinary as ordinary can be. We ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs. It's basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning. Wouldn't recommend.
Lamb ravioli - It's a shame we don't get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta. Even if they do, it's mostly vegetarian (spinach and ricotta cheese without exception). To our delight, Frio doesn't disappoint here. The ravioli is good (doesn't make it to my top 5 list), but still good. Ravioli was cooked well, herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy.
We couldn't get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order (20 mins before closing), but I have heard that their tiramisu is great.
All in all, Frio is a good place to visit. In terms of food, you could love or let's say not love the place basis what dish you ordered. I won't be a frequent here, but wouldn't mind going back for another try either.

I've ordered spaghetti aglio e olio from this place.
It was soaking in oil and very less quantity.

The packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care. No spoon/fork and tissues were given with the pack.

I really liked the way they didn't backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes. Keeping the oil aside, the taste was good. However, there is scope for improvement because I've read good things about this place and their food.

Ambience was decent. It was a tad too dark for my liking, but the spacious table setting and the gentle hit tracks playing in the background made up for a nice dinner setting.
Service was pretty decent. The waiter who attended our table was courteous and prompt in serving.
The food was a big disappointment though. Of all the dishes we ordered, few starters and the tiramisu cake were the only saving grace. Main course (Spinach ravioli, Belly dance pizza, Stuffed chicken breast and Greek chicken sovlakhi) was a total disaster. Not a single person from our group of 6 could find anything tasty from this bunch. We finished the meal off with tiramisu and dbc cake, which was good and filling.

The doner kebabs are filled with juicy lamb meat balls and topped with spicy mayo stuffed inside fluffly pita breads with a sude of humus.

In pizza, I love the pigs over a blanket pizza. The pizza crust is super thin and this place serves one of the best wood fire pizzas here.

In mains, the pork ribs just melts in your mouth and the stuffed chicken breast is deliciously with the filling of creamy spinach inside.

In desserts I loved all their creations from the baklava, to cherry chocolate cheese cake and to the old fashioned tiramisu...

Have been to this place couple of times and Everytime tried something new in veg. But pizza has been a constant one. The Spanish rice too has a very authentic taste and was in competition to the pizza to give ultimate pleasure to tell taste buds. These two dishes have been my favorite and most recommend tough have tried other dishes as well.
A friendly staff and zomato gold is a value addition to this place.

I have been to pizza events where the restaurants where claiming that it's the best pizza in town or money back .

Frio Bistro,Monali Mohanty,"Been to this place last month. Quite a peaceful place not many people were there. We ordered some drinks and pizza and pasta. I somehow felt pizza could have been little better the taste was good and it was cooked properly. But there were literally no toppings except chicken. Pasta was clearly not upto the mark. I had given specific instructions which weren't taken care at all. Also, later during the billing there were some confusions on the gold membership. We did inform the staff at tge beginning that we have Zomato gold however not sure if that was well communicated to the management, because during the billing we were said that we should have informed about the gold membership earlier which we clearly did. But didn't quite understood whats the problem if it is not communicated at the beginning..

Decided to check it out and was badly disappointed.

The mild mushroom soup was too bland and they don't serve a 1/2 of the soup. You will have to order 2 soups instead.

The Red Rooster pizza just didn't have any taste to it.
Gachibowli fried chicken was a disaster.

Stuffed grilled chicken breast was the only face saver at this place.

The regular water they served had dust floating on it, had to get bottled water.

Would never go to this place again. Won't recommend to anyone either.

The lamb pizza which I suspect used the same sauce as the kheema was good but too salty likely cus it's meant to be eaten with spaghetti. The mezze platter is enough for one person barely. It's literally a single plate filled with 3 dips and 6 breads the size of a palm without fingers.

The desserts is where this place shines. They apparently think tiramisu is a soggy cake..? That fondant cake should taste still of maida because they didn't understand the concept and that managers should barely give a shit OR apologize.

Frio Bistro,Sidharth Thallancherry,"The place has a nice quiet ambience, I was surprised that it wasn't crowded as you'd expect a top place to be on a weekend.

We were ushered in well and we choose a nice cozy place, the place had a nice charm to it . We ordered the Tangy Grilled Mushrooms and the Glazed Pork Ribs, but the disappointing aspect of our visit though was we were rushed into placing the order. We came in at 10pm and we were told to place our last orders instantly, when I checked they said the place shuts down at 11pm and the last order was at 10:15pm.

Coming to food, the mushrooms seemed a bit too tangy but that's probably my palate , the glazed pork ribs were top notch and juicy and tender. Had it not been for the pushy waiters we would have liked to order drinks and a dessert too.

The waiters made sure that they cleared the plates in a jiffy and pounced on us with our last spoon handing us the copy of the bill and all of this before we even touched 11pm. Not that our intentions were to have a night out there but you don't actually liked to be rushed on your orders and food, it just doesn't leave a good experience, Possibly the restaurant and it's employees were planning on catching a flight and made sure nothing came in the way.

There were not many customers around and that definitely helped us get some attention but the service was OK. We carefully curated our order - Chimichuri Pan Fried Fish, Lamb Ravioli and Andhra Pepper Chicken Pizza. I must say the food tasted authentic and delicious.

Chimichuri Pan Fried Fish, the chef's special, came with fish boasting a tangy and spicy herb crust, salsa, sauteed spinach and scallion rice. It was easily the best dish we ordered. The Lamb Ravioli was creamy but we were searching for the minced meat therein. Then came the spicy Andhra Pepper Chicken Pizza. It generated some interest despite diminishing appetite by then.

All in all, the place did come across as expensive for the items and portion sizes but worth a visit.

Spicy tomato arabitta turned out to be a tasteless flavour less offering. When we informed the Steward he got a fresh one made personally supervising. Turned out to be too saucy, no traces of parmesan cheese, probably it could have had few more pieces of the penne.

Although I was the second one in the cue but the family whose billing was under process had more than 4 basket filled with items which approx would have more than 40 items. In not less than 5 mins the cue extended till 5 people waiting for the billing. When asked to the manager, to operate other billing counters he replied ""WE DON'T HAVE MANPOWER"". Frustrated with the cue, we asked how can you just have manpower for one billing counter where you have machinery available for 3 he replied, ""WE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO HIRE""!

Karachi Cafe,Vignesh Rk,"This place has a really aesthetic ambiance starting from the vintage design to the 60-70s music that plays in the background.
We ordered the famous Irani chai with a bunch of onion samosa, fries and a pasta sandwich.

This place serves one of the best Irani Chai that i have had in hyderabad. The onion samosa takes me back to my childhood days when we used to buy them at small shops for a rupee or so. They tasted amazing here. I wouldn't recommend getting the chai ir samosa delivered at all. Kills the taste completely. These needs to be had hot and getting it delivered will definitely disappoint.

Talking about the fries, i wouldn't say they were amazing but they sure weren't bad. We did not like the Pasta sandwich. This item wouldn't be something that i would recommend.

This place would remain one of my favorite spots to hangout at.

The second time, my female friend wanted to use the washroom but it was extremely dirty and smelling.

Karachi Cafe,Andleeb Zaidi,"Want good back grounds for a retro themed photoshoot and while you’re at it , munch on some delicious food? Karachi Cafe , Gachibowli is THE place for you!
Food:
•Peri peri chicken- This dish includes chicken breast topped with peri peri sauce ,is served with mashed potatoes ,Garlic bread and sautéed vegetables.
The chicken was properly marinated and cooked to perfection with the tenderness still intact, it was already sliced to bite sized pieces.
•Chicken pesto sandwich- The sandwiches have a filling of chicken marinated in pesto sauce along with cucumbers and tomatoes; served with potato wedges and tomato ketchup. It has very light taste and perfect meal for two on Hot summer day.
•Bun Maska- Literally the best BUNS you could get your hands on! Filled with fresh cream, melted butter and a layer of white sugar, it’s literally addictive!

Beverages:
•Cold coffee- The beverage wasn’t cold or strong enough to be called as cold coffee in the first place. Would not recommend this drink.
•Irani chai- generally Irani chai is suppose to be milky and sweet but this wasn’t very sugary. It had a mild yet tempting taste . Would definitely recommend.

Ambience: Every wall is decorated with vintage posters, articles and artwork, the front panel of the cafe is made of glass which gives a beautiful glowing effect to the space and the green plants add to its beauty.

The items we ordered were Barbeque Mushroom Sandwich, Spaghetti in Alfredo sauce with Vegetables, Apple Pie with Vanilla Ice cream, Irani Chai and Filter Kapi. Apart from the apple pie, all the items were really tasty. The pie's crust was a bit too thick. Rest, everything was worth every single penny. I would love to visit this place again.

Tea - I am a tea lover and hence can never get over this
Keema Pav - good
Irani onion samosa - definitely recommend
Bun Maska - dip it in tea and enjoy

We came in late but the place was still lively. On entering, you definitely notice the ambiance which is a bit idyllic and retro. With the 70s and the 80s song playing in the background, you definitely feel like going back in some time. 

We settled in and ordered fries, keema pav, and chicken farcha. To gulp it all down we ordered the Irani chai. 

Boy o boy we were in for a treat. All the dishes were simply delicious and mouthwatering. Their keema pav is true to its name and fame, amazing. The chicken farcha was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. All the dishes were served piping hot which enhanced the taste.

Service was a bit slow but it could be understood as the meals were served hot. Though the place is small, it can comfortably sit a good amount of people with seating outside as well. Slightly on the pricier side, we still felt it was worth it given the quantity. With the trusted name of Karachi sweets as the backers, you can definitely count on the quality.

Karachi Cafe,Tamal Sarkar,"Starting off I was amazed by the looks and ambience of the place from the side of the road ! So I was anticipating it !

On a sunny Sunday morning I convinced my friends to come down here !

The ambience and the themed decorations was fascinating and how they maintained it so well and beautifully
The kettle shaped water jug and the bulb shaped salt containers the rough and old furniture look and the old Bollywood movie dialogue and old popular brands ! All of it put together was so so appealing to me !
The old big radio and the dial up Telephones brought back so many childhood memories !

Coming to what we ordered

BBQ chicken Sub
Chicken 65 Sub
Omlette Sandwich
Crispy Chicken burgers
Apple pie with Vanilla ice cream

The first thing that as lovely about each of these(except Apple pie of course) that they were whole some and there were generous amount of French fries t and wedges to go along with the mains !

I had the burger and it was damn fulfilling
Crispy square chicken patties and layered with veggies and lettuce, it was really nice! however to be critical it could have done with more cheese or mayonnaise !

The Subs were spicy and had substantial chicken pieces and the omlette Sandwich was pretty decent too !
Overall I felt the pocket pinch was quite normal for a cafe ! At least the food satisfied our appetite !

P.S. - They took their theme very seriously and that shows when you enter the washroom !
You'll find a old Rexona ad in a frame !

All in all the place seemed perfect for all occasions for a romantic date or getaway
For a group outing for people who love Ambience and for random tea meet ups as well !

We ordered various things like samosas, chicken kobirazi, veg cutlet, paneer kathi roll, macaroni sandwich, veg grilled sandwich etc. All the items were very good and pretty tasty. The Irani chai was fabulous.

It's a place with the theme old is gold, so you can see pictures from the past hanging on the walls.

Karachi Cafe,Jalaj Goyal,"It was a payday and was looking for pocket friendly restaurant in Indira Nagar area when we encountered Karachi Cafe!! As you enter the restaurant you time travel to 80s-90s era. The wall paint, bit rugged, and the walls decorated with movie posters and advertisements of the bygone era. To submerge you in that majestic generation they have kept a black and white television set, radio and a landline with round dialling pad, milk cans, kettle, glass jars, and of course the attire of the waiters!! The old melodies make you just go wow!!

Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Kabiraji and Macaroni Pink Grilled Chicken Pasta!!
Let's discuss each in an order.

Chicken Kabiraji was so tender and delectable that you will just forget about the surroundings and will just relish the flavour of kasundi with the awesomely fried cutlets dipped in beaten egg!!!

Next delicacy, Macaroni Pink Grilled Chicken Pasta. Remotely similar taste of pasta which I experienced was a long time back. The blend of red and white sauce will leave you speechless. The quantity was great for two.

I would suggest to visit this place with good hopes and do try other items on the list!!

Tells you blatantly that your order will take time (more than 40 mins before I placed the order). I checked in at 8 40 am!
Ambience is a great miss for sure. Super duper uncomfortable seats.
Add:
The pancakes are very average. Could be more fluffy.
They did not have waffles, so i can't tell.
Eggs: shambles not scrambled. Over salty in places. No salt in rest of the place. Why are you charging so much if you can mess up eggs.
Tea: the only reason I beimg kind and can say 2.5 is tea. Lovely tea. Quite a hassle btw for just tea though 😂",2,"18 Reviews , 146 Followers",1/20/2019 8:41,1,,"{'food': ['pancakes', 'eggs'], 'drink': ['tea']}"

What a shawarma it was.. I ordered twice from this restaurant, though it has been quite while since I ordered, my bad.. The good things need to be acknowledged whthr late or early it doesn't make any difference. Let's start with the review. I ordered
1. shawarma
2. colddrink
3. waffle+ ice-cream for the frst time and secomd time I onlu ordered chicken shwrma.

What a treat it was to look at the packaging taste and everything was so good.I am quitd impressed by their service. They need to work on just one thing.

Imrovement Needed

The portion size should be a little more.

This is the first place I came with my best friend. He forced me to come out of my room and asked me to decide about the food. Shawarmas. That was it. I saw that I could try the vegetarian version here, so I was happy.

We had our respective types of Shawarmas: he had chicken and I was more than joyous about having the vegetarian one. We got to listen to good music, hear the incessant chatterboxes talking out loud but we found silence in our own way and conversed about our ideas. It was good food, good company and a great experience. Just that, it can hurt your pocket a little!",4,"122 Reviews , 639 Followers",12/1/2018 22:53,0,,"{'food': ['Shawarmas'], 'drink': []}"

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,The Fit Foodie 😋😎🤑,"Delivery review
What I ordered - best of both worlds which is a combination of waffles and pancakes served with scrambled egg accompanied by choice of beverage which I choose tea
Price - 199 plus taxes.
Food review - the food was in general leaning towards healthy taste though it was not mentioned as such. The scrambled eggs were without any kind of spices and just tossed in butter. Pancake was nice and fluffy but the maple syrup was too less to enjoy it fully u can see the pics. Waffles tasted bland but may be coz it was just plain waffle and it was too hard thumbs down 👇. Tea was really nice and was warm enough and they provided a disposable cup which was quite cute. Special mention to the superb packaging and value for money which urged me to give an extra one star though the food was a 3 🌟🌟🌟 for me.

Talking about the taste, we ordered chicken shawarma combo and rice bowl combo. The taste of shawarma didn’t reach our expectations but the rice bowl combo was really good! Need to work on the shawarma cuz the taste levels of shawarma is pretty high!
Regarding the service, the waiters were good & humble the service was good but faced an issue with the payment. Their swiping machine wasn’t working so i had to go for an ATM which irritated me.

It was Wednesday and had a ladies night I think. But as you know, gold can't be availed with ladies' night privileges 😔

We got seating very easily. Don't know of that was a good thing or bad, because the place was very empty. Only 2 other tables were seated I think.

Ambience is okay.. music- can be better. Cocktails were good. You can actually tell them to do some tweaks to your drinks as per your likeness and they would do it.

The food is the shittiest thing ever made and eaten in human history. The waiters are rude and incompetent to either understand hindi or English. The acoustics in the karaoke nights sucks. When we asked for a manger, three different waiters came to us and finally when we said we won't pay the bill until the manager addresses our concerns is when the amazing pot bellied, arrogant and rude manager showed up. His name is Ali and he was in no mood to listen to any of the feedback we provided instead he offered as 2 free drinks which we definitely didn't need because somewhere he already agreed with the feedback we gave but he didn't want to do anything about it. When I tried explaining him that we would pay the bill, add tip and don't want free drinks but we want him to take the feedback seriously, he was like ""if u r leaving, leave, why are u wasting my time?"" I lost it and I was telling my friend, I repeat, I was talking to my friend stating ""what the fuck is wrong with this place"" is when he interrupts me and says that I need to mind my language. I was like, WHAT? ""I"" am talking to ""my friend"" about the ""place"" What's your problem in that? And I literally said sorry even, joined my hands for forgiveness to which he replies staying ""ye badtameez ladkia yaha aati he kyu hai, tmko jo karna hai karlo, ladkiya he ho na, kya ukhaadlogi, UKHAAD lo.""

The Beer we selected from menu was not available so we decided to go for bucket of Corona bucket. Bucket beers are either served in ice bucket or at least bar tender ask customers to check it is chilled. Well here the good bar tender bought all six beers holding in his hand and was about to open it when we checked its temp. We were surprised to find it almost equal to room temp. And the irritating part was when the waiter behaved as if its too normal to serve such beer.

We asked for the best food they have and in next 10 mins we had Dragon chicken served. Eating it all I can say if it's ur best then your worst is not for humans.

Next we ordered crispy corn not to surprise us crispy part was completely missing and masala added on top of it was enough to burn ur taste bud.

After the first serving of 1 veg starter we waited for another 20 mins. 
My colleague asked the manager if more veg starters will be served, and this was his answer.
""Abhi aap ne kya khaya ??.. Panner khaya na.... woh veg hi hota"".

They told us there will be 500 entry charge per person but that wont be a coupon inside to get anything. So it was 1500 for us 3 and food & drinks charges being seperate. We saw the menu rates online and felt it to be fine.
When we went there, for entry as they told 1500 we had to pay and that too they said they will only take cash 1500. Cards will be accepted inside but not accepted to take it for entry fee.
We always keep cards mostly, luckily we had that much cash, paid and went inside.
Got a table for 4 for us 3.
So like first mistake of staff when ordered a Mojito- Mocktail as I dont drink, and they instead of Mocktail send a Cocktail - Alcoholic Drink.
Second mistake of staff, as we are purely vegetarians- in beginning itself we mentioned that and ordered a paneer starter and some crispy potato starter. And they came and served Non Veg starter.
After complaining about this both to staff, they apologised and said it won't repeat.
Now when we repeated our starter and ordered crispy potato again, AGAIN for the 3rd time they sent incorrect order and a Non Veg Starter again to us.
I complained to Manager and he said sorry and staff said sorry but they didnt even had courtesy to make it up to their 3 huge mistakes back to back by any discounts which they could do LEAST.
Not that I asked for any but that was courtesy on their side.
So when all this wrong orders were going on in between of that we were asked to adjust on the seat of 2 and they made other people sit on our table across us even after reserving table and paying for it.
Ok and the last thing, the DJ mostly 70% of time was playing VERY OLD SONGS which I again didn't enjoy.
Oh yes and forgot to mention that they had increased prices on drinks and all food and had a whole seperate new menu for 31st December 2018 with increased prices.",1,"5 Reviews , 76 Followers",1/7/2019 15:59,0,,"{'food': ['paneer starter', 'crispy potato starter'], 'drink': ['Mocktail']}"

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Jagannadh Chowdary,"Ambience was superb .. food was good .. table booking is highly recommended on both weekdays & weekends.. I Visited with family felt very comfortable although it's a bar+kitchen. so, it's not the prefect place to hangout with gang but surely can have a try once .. initially we planned for ala carte , but went for buffet because ala carte seems expensive compared to other restaurants.. Peaceful experience no distractions what so ever..
prefer to have spicy food it's the best place to visit .. starters were amazing Fish was superb (Spicy) .

I booked a table 1day prior to my visit but still had to wait 45min for table after i entered the restaurant.. only this was my negative feedback on my visit.

Ambiance- 3.5/5
It has a black theme with modern crafty ceilings & is dimly lit but not dark. One of the pleasant ambiance around that area, best for evenings with friends/ colleagues. The seating was not very comfortable. They also have a bar setup and dance floor as well.

Food- 3/5

We were about 15 people opted for buffet. The broccoli and spinach soup was very tasty and had right amount of spiciness. For starters we had crispy veg- perfect, chilli paneer- very spicy, hara bhara kebab - was decent.
For main course, the veg spread was not very interesting and was not appetising.
DESSERTS were the best! The pineapple cake was really delicious and the Phirni was creamy and perfect!
Overall the food was good but can be improved.

The staff was not polite and we were dissappointed with their behaviour, there were a couple of instances when they didn't understand our request and were a bit rude in their behaviour.

In starters, Paneer Tikka, Chilli corn salt and pepper and Egg bhurji pao were good in taste and we enjoyed having them.
In main course, we ordered Dal makhani and Paneer lababdar which were upto the expectations.

Nothing can be better than having a dessert to end the evening and we did the same by ordering Gulab jamun.

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Vineet Nanda,"This restaurant has its priorities straight. Unlike AB's, Flechazo, and Barbeque Nation- that swing for the fences and end up failing many times- this place has hit a sweet balance between Hospitality and Taste.

Which means you have none of the irritating, fake-friendly, over-eager monkeys from the above-mentioned places, pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you don't want to.

Instead, you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business, until you order for something. Very professional, indeed.

The starters are awesome here; they actually set the tone for the things to come. This place features a wide-range of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well, which is a big step up from its competitors. Kebabs are to die for.

Having said that, the main meal was nothing to write home about. They have tried a lot of things, from Mughlai, Intercontinental, to Chinese, but somehow these dishes don't come together on the plate.

But what actually took my heart away, what this joint EXCELS in, hands-down, compared to ANY FREAKING RESTAURANT IN THE CITY is the Desserts department. For someone who loves sweets, it's a psychedelic experience.

The variety and taste will haunt you for days. The desserts are neither too sweet, nor too rich. Just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about.

I was thoroughly satisfied, and if you leave out the clove-heavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu, then the place is a RockaRolla discovery.

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Mallika Bhupathiraju,This place opened last year and is a small place but is very happening . The evening I went there was an office party going on and there was a buffet catered for them. This place has a small dance floor and nice interiors.

Usually you just get the egg booked on top of the rice, but here, they cut it and the spice is inside of the cut Egg. How cool and tasty. I did have some before like this but this, this taste. Yummmmm. Kudos!

However they have done complimentary sweet for everyone the day I went there. That wasn't all that good. Way to sweet. Uhh.

Among starters, bamboo chicken and bangla kodi are my favorites.
Bamboo chicken is very tender and it gets cooked inside a hollow bamboo stick and its sizzling hot with yummy taste.
Bangla kodi is very unique with each chicken piece wrapped in a sliced potato, this is a must try.
They have got a wide range of main course to cater to everyone's need, I have tried prawns vepudu pulav, this is the dish to go for if you like prawns, spicy, yummy, tasty, fulfilling and satiating.
Pachi mirchi kodi pulav and Gadwal kodi pulav are great too. Raju gari kodi pulav is their signature dish, but it will be soggy so not everybody may like it.
Don't forget to cool off your taste buds with rose milk or junnu in the end

We tried the bamboo chicken which is an iconic telugu appetizer that has soft tender chicken cooked with right amount of spices. Mamsam vepudu which was the star of the show with spicy, perfectly cooked mutton that justified it being telugu cuisine. The Rajugari Kodi Pulao was the best of all.
This pulao had a different taste and texture, unlike biryani, this dish is similar to a porridge with soft chicken and delicious curry. This place has huge variety of appetizers, curries and rice in chicken, mutton,seafood and veg options.

Ulavacharu,Vamsi ®,"Too much hyped....!!!

Heard a lot about this restaurant, but finally it ended up with a disappointment, mainly the pulav's.
Initially we were offered complementary sweets.Tried Pachi Mirchi Kodi pulav,Oorugallu Veg Pulav,Kotha Kodi & Crunchy curd cutlet.

Pachi Mirchi Pulav - was nice but lacked the expected spiciness,though its a medium varient.
Oorugallu Veg Pupav- Mostly tasted like normal rice but the spice mix was quite authentic, tasted like baby onions coocked with mango pickle.Quite a different experience, never had one like this before.
Kotha Kodi- Just an edited version of Chicken Majestic.
Crunchy curd cutlet - Good but too oily.

Finally ended the meal with a dessert(Junnu), which was good of all the items i had in the restaurant.

Good thing about the restraunt is it had a decent ambience and can accommodate quick a good number.Service was generous but a bit slow.

Overall food taste was just ok, lacked the heat.Can be improved a lot...",3,"49 Reviews , 987 Followers",12/30/2018 19:28,8,,"{'food': ['Pachi Mirchi Kodi pulav', 'Oorugallu Veg Pupav', 'Kotha Kodi', 'Crunchy curd cutlet'], 'drink': []}"

Bamboo chicken has good flavors but was more than mildly spicy. It is served directly from the bamboo box it is cooked in. It also has dry gravy so it's not entirely a good choice for starters, will go well with any Indian bread.
Pachi Mirchi kodi pulao was awesome. The rice was flavorful. Chicken curry served over it was semi - gravy and yummy as well. The chicken was nicely complementing the rice.

Why am I preaching this because all these varieties are to be found in Ulavacharu.

Ulavacharu is a vibrant Telugu Brand having branches throughout Hyderbad. Banjarahills, Gachibowli etc....

Their Unique Dishes names, taste especially their crispy chicken skin, although a little tweeek is much needed to the palatte of Hyd. So overall the setup is amazing it just doesn't serve food it gives you an experience. A Must visit place.

Shanghai Chef 2,Singh Rahul,"The Overall Rating present for this restaurant doesn't justice the experience (will come to this in a bit)

So, a small almost cute little place tucked in first floor with ambient lightings turned on (to give romantic dinner table feel) and apt audible english chartbusters couldn't go any wrong with setup and restaurant proudly own this.
With this as a beginning, shanghai chef takes the dinning experience to whole new diff level which is confusing at its best. Waiters are surely not in the mood to offer appropriate tables to guests, not aware of all the food which is getting prepared in kitchen, not aware of all the 'Must Try' dishes of their own menu & most of all courtesy seems to have been left at the mercy of the servers. Like an example, since its not a fine dining we can't expect servers to serve your food left in the bowl again but same server at one table doing the same thing neglecting other tables left too much to be desired. This was the case, when a cockroach was found in one of the guests food and staff tried to avoid the scene blaming it to fate.
On the food side, crispy corn was good but avoid maonchow soup. Flat noodles also served just warm that too after enquiring multiple times.Also, Service takes the beating even if just half tables are filled.

So, coming back to first line. The rating is probably for food only, go at your own risk if your are looking for experience !",2,"24 Reviews , 409 Followers",12/8/2018 15:09,1,,"{'food': ['crispy corn', 'flat noodles'], 'drink': []}"

Ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing, but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese ,oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving. Food was so spicy that we were sipping water after every bite and after few bites i had started tearing up. It was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (P.S. we are a family who loves spicy food). Also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate.

The seating is well, the air conditioning is not. Its either chilly or completely stopped. You cant help it.

The servers are less and even being a small place, you have to shout to catch their attention.

The food. Oh God! I dont know what happened with the chef that day, but he had put spinach in all of my dishes and that too in huge quantities. They were wreaking havoc on the plate and we had to leave a dish totally for that matter.

So many wrongs, bounds me to visit them once again to see whether they are like this all the time or was I unfortunate to visit them on their bad day. They also need a experienced manager.

I always wanted to visit authentic chineese restaurants and this was the one.
The service was very good along with a perfect ambience.
Lets begin with the food part:
We started with a couple of soups Tom Kha Gai (which was a coconut milk based chicken soup and it was very yummy as you can feel the coconut flavour) followed by lemon corriander soup which was also good.
Amongst the starters we tried Tei Pei Chicken,Kung pao Chicken, Phuket fish( this was one of the best as the fish was perfectly fried and it was also crispy), Drawn prawns (nice crispy which nice sausage).
Now the best part was the Shu mai, the dumplings were great and delicious it was my first time though but i found it really great.
In the main course we had Phad Thai Phak(spicy flavored rice with nice flavours and the aroma was too tempting😋),Burmese Khow Suey which were steamed noodles with several add-ons like peanuts, fried onions etc. (a must try one if you visit this place).
We also had some mocktails my personal favorite was Fall in love along with a couple of other like fruit punch .....
The last but not the least the desert part we had fried ice-creams which had coconut base and it was very yummy 😋.

Service was really great .

When it come to chineese cuisine , I thought to order few authentic dishes .

Firstly they served us with soup : chicken manchow soup and tom kha gai/gung which is coconut based. People who likes coconut based cuisine then they must try this.
Coming to starters we ordered tai Pai chicken, dragon prawns, Kung Pao, Phuket fish, dumplings named shu mai. Out of these best was Phuket fish which was crispy frm outside .

Main course: They served us Burmese know suey , again this is coconut based dish where the gravy is made out of coconut . It's served with plain noodles , add ons like peanuts, fried onions , green chillies, variety of suaces .
Pad Thai rice which was just like fried rice .

Shanghai Chef 2,Abhishek Gupta,"I had visited few among many Chinese places in past. Recently got a chance to visit Shaghai Chef, located at prime location, Indra Nagar. Welcomed nicely by the staff members.

I didn't thought much about food in starting, as people don't eat Chinese daily and I am weak in remembering Chinese dishes name, I had one thing in my mind, Shezwan :P. But as soon as the dinner started, I was surprised, there is more to it, started with Tom kha gai/gung - Chicken Soup, Coconut based soup, creamy and smooth, with spices and topped with red chilli, one word, fantabulous. Then the marathon started, one after another I was enjoying every bite, had few expression changes in between but at end, the conclusion - amazing dinner.

Strated with starter, Tai pai chicken, Dragon prawns... Pakoda kind, tossed to give a spicy flavour, I am not a fan of prawns, so can't say, Kung puo chicken... Was decent, Phuket fish... basha fish, kind of crispy from outside, soft inside, tasted amazing, and the dumplings, named Shu mai, open dumplings with minced chicken, it's not spices but is simply wow, go for it. Tried few mocktails, was ok but need some improvement, other than that everything was good. And then the deserts, ice cream on brownie and fried ice cream were something hatke, must try.

In main course we had, Burmese khow suey... Noodles mixed with coconut kind gravy, not spicy with stuffs to add on, liked fried peanut, fried onions, chillis, diff sauces etc. and Phad thai Rice, both were also good. Overall had a good time and dinner, the staff members made our food tasting visit more comfortable.

Shanghai Chef 2,Nelu J,"This restaurant have got a very peaceful atmosphere so been to this place for dinner with friends.We ordered soups 1st were my favourite was Toma Gai/Gung which is a rich coconut milk based prawns Thai soup.We can taste the thick coconut milk taste and being a malayalee I always love the coconut taste and I just loved this one.It is a mild soup which give a small sweetness of coconut milk.Other two soups we ordered were manchow soup and Chicken lemon coriander soup.Manchow soup dint taste like how it is suppose to be.We ordered the chicken one so it was a spicy soup with a chilly and garlic combo and coming to the chicken lemon coriander soup,it had a strong taste of lemon with minced chicken and vegetables and I dint like that much but my friend who ordered this soup loved this.

Now coming to the starters,we ordered Dragon prawns,Tei pei chicken,Kung puo chicken,Shu mai dumplings,Phuket fish.We were served with dragon prawns first which was crispy added into a sauce and garnished with cashew nuts kinda dish which is spicy.Tei Pei dish was a starter which I loved than the dragon prawns one,which is mildy sweet one and not too spicy like dragon prawns.So the last starter we tried was Phuket fish which was cooked well and it was fried kinda hard and added to soya sauce and tasted awesome.Coming to djmoljngs we had Shu mai dumplings which are steamed and half opened dumplings which was tasting too good with the chilly sauce.

We ordered mocktails after the starter and we had Fall in Love which I really loved which had a mixed taste of both litchi and strawberry,Litchi Punch which I ordered which doesn't give the colour of litchi and dint give too much of litchi taste,alfonza which is of mango and tasted great and also fruit punch which was a mixed fruit mocktail.They have mentioned mocktail with scoop of ice cream so I dint find a scoop in it or don't know whether they mix it with the juice and serve but all were tasting great.

Now coming to the main course we had Burmese khow suey and Phad Thai phak.We had the Burmese dish which was ma favourite again as it is made of rich coconut milk and noodles one and too yummy for your tummy dish.This dish was served with other set of seasonings and condiments so people do try this one and you will love this and this is creamy non-spicy dish.Phad Thai Phak which was of rice type garnished with an egg omelette which is like a fried rice dish and a spicy one.

Last we had fried ice cream and brownie with ice-cream as desserts.Both were yummy where brownie ice cream was served with butterscotch ice cream flavour with a strawberry sauce as the topping and fried ice-cream coating is made of coconut so do try these.",4,"49 Reviews , 390 Followers",8/26/2018 10:15,14,,"{'food': ['Toma Gai/Gung', 'Manchow soup', 'Chicken lemon coriander soup', 'Dragon prawns', 'Tei pei chicken', 'Kung puo chicken', 'Shu mai dumplings', 'Phuket fish'], 'drink': ['Fall in Love', 'Litchi Punch', 'Alfonza', 'Fruit punch', 'Burmese khow suey', 'Phad Thai phak', 'Fried ice cream', 'Brownie with ice-cream']}"

Shanghai Chef 2,Rita Singh,"What a scrumptious dinner at Shanghai chef 2.

After a long day at chilkur Balaji we we're so hungry that we just wanted to check-in to some restaurant where we will get food like the moment we enter. However, good food was also a priority to us, also being rainy season street food is a little matter of concern for hygiene.

The first thing that came into my mind when we touched gachibowli was sanghai chef.We did not take a second thought and went straight into the restaurant.

The restaurant has very cozy ambiance with simple decor, comfortable seating and dim lighting. So neat and clean that it was hard to believe when suhail Bhai told us that it's a 10 years old restaurant and his first one.

Aditya came to our rescue and we just told him ki bro get whatever is best you feel, he suggested us all the dishes throughout.

We started off with TOM KHA GHAI SOUP : Actually this was a great choice being succha cold weather outside and we being so tired. The garlic and bamboo stick flavours could actually help our bad throat and the coconut flavoured soup with loads of fresh veggies and big chunks of chiken we're so refreshing.

We then ordered NASI GORENG CHIKEN :Long grains of perfectly cooked rice with loads and loads of flavours in it. **Must try** and BAR B Q CHIKEN : this was perfect combination with the rice, lil sweet, spicy and flavoursome chiken cooked semi wet.**Must try**

Mix sea food soft noodles and mix sea food rice were amazing too.

Burmese khow sue was one amazing dish too ❤️❤️❤️

For take away we ordered PHAD THAI MIX SEA FOOD NOODLES.....and trust me after having so much at restaurant, I couldn't resist when Rawshan opened the box at home. I went ahead and gulped down four spoons of it. Oh my god, this is one AmaZing dish that I have tasted in recent times and if tell you about quantity, one take away of this is sufficient for three people.

Flat noodles cooked with garlic, fresh herbs, prawns and fish, with mushroom and sweet sauce. Also fresh red chilli. *** A must must try ****

Quantity of food served here is unbelievable.

For the taste and quantity and quality the VFM factor is best in the town.

Bill came to 1600+ for 4 after 10% friendly gesture discount.

Staff is very friendly and Aditya was great at service.

We were about to leave Suhail SuhRac MacAdams bumped into us. It was great meeting you. And thanks for making our dinner so special.",5,"106 Reviews , 1893 Followers",7/15/2018 12:48,10,,"{'food': ['TOM KHA GHAI SOUP', 'NASI GORENG CHIKEN', 'BAR B Q CHIKEN', 'MIX SEA FOOD NOODLES', 'PHAD THAI MIX SEA FOOD NOODLES'], 'drink': []}"

Udipi's Upahar,Ashok Prabhakaran,"One of the best places to have South Indian tiffin varieties in Gachibowli area.  Most cost effective and tasty, quick fast food on offer. I enjoyed the food here and have tried out many times and on almost daily too.  If anyone have any doubt, the crowd that is present here almost all of the time should indicate the popularity of the joint here. 

Situated in a busy area on the Gachibowli main road near to the ORR inter-junction. You cannot miss the place. I have tried out their meals, tiffin varieties, the bhajji & pakodas in the evening and also their tea. Have been satisfied with all of it and do not have any complaints. 

Absolutely zero ambiance and its self service too. Be prepared for the rush and once you get the token, be prepared to be squeezed in a corner to give out your token to the waiters inside. There is no queue system here and they just collect your tokens at random.  When your food item is ready, they spot you and give it to you. Be prepared for some hassles out here as you get jostled around. Finding a spot to eat your food during rush hour is also a problem. There are a couple of tables to sit but majority of the others stand at the tables and eat. Just eat your food quick and rush out. 

My fav of theirs is the Dosa. I just loved the Chutney and the sambar taste even though it was a bit sweeter to my taste.

Mathura Vilas,SAI PRASANTH .M,"Tried this place after a long time. The order was just a south indian thali, peas pulav, Mixed subzi chatpata and a Strawberry milkshake.
Arrived at the restaurant by 2.15 on a sunday afternoon. After a full 40 mins the first dish to be served was milkshake!! Will a restaurant serve side drink / dessert first, when the main course is yet to be served?

Service 1/5 - you will see waiters only while ordering the food, once the order is taken you wont even see them coming to your table even to serve water. You will see them standing in one corner of the restaurant, few walking in and out of the kitchen as if they are very busy. But no one will respond when you raise your hand/ or call for them. I literally had ti walk to them and ask for water.

Ambiance 1/5 -
Some kind of strange smell comes similar to the one you get in a dumped wet cloths
In short a worthless place.

Food quality and taste 1/5.
Coming to the quality of food - the peas pulav had just peas in them i hardly found rice!.
Very salty mixed subzi chatpata dish which just had onions and capsicum.
As mentioned before the food was served after 40 mins. The south indian thali had a sambar - it was a hot water in which dhal was washed and rasam was just hot water; when requested for a refill of bindi (it was the only dish that was nice), I was told that the dish got over unfortunately due to the time. I seriously wonder what took them 40 mins to serve, I have never had such a bad experience before in any restaurant of this level.

Value for money - 0.5/5

For these so called high quality dishes I had to pay around 900. In short i will not suggest this place at all.",1,"13 Reviews , 1 Follower",5/3/2019 21:24,0,,"{'food': ['peas pulav', 'Mixed subzi chatpata'], 'drink': ['Strawberry milkshake']}"

Food was pathetic as well. Tanduri roti that we ordered was made of maida. And the dishes were either too oily or just bad.

Overall this place is very bad and doesn't deserve a visit at all. There are plenty of restaurants all around Hyderabad which are much better than this for half the rate.

I called the manager and asked why is it taking so long as we habe only asked a thali and lassi. Then he told us that some of the food got over so we are preparing it again so only it is taking so much time. But is was courtesy that he could have informed us that it is going to take time.

No shame, no options to offer what could be served quickly. Just a plain no. I walked up, they asked me to pay for a bottle of water (which I consumed) and left. The manager didn't even bother.

1) the thali was filled with sambar, green chutney and sweet chutney, 1 peas corn gravy, 1 alloo gravy, mixture, navratan kurma and dry banana veggie, sour curd, samudana vada, samudana khichadi, payasam, fruit salad

2) there was no dal, no kadi, or any orther sabji/gravy in the thali. except for the kurma and corn-peas sabji nothing was appetizing enough

3) welcome drink like chaas/jaljeera which is usually a part of any thali in india was not served. on asking the manager he tells us that chaas is a part of the thali but that they missed swrving us

4) only fruit salad and payasam was given to us in the thali. again we had to ask the waiters if they had served all that was a part of the thali. only after enquiring abt the items did they mention that there is yet another sweet which they forgot to include.

Mathura Vilas,Rahul Ratnawat,"Awesome food.Good for Veg food lovers.They serve both thali and ala carte food.

We ordered Manchow soup , tomato soup , Tandoori mushrooms and Tandoori Aloo in starters.

Mushrooms i must say was spicy but too good. Almost melted in mouth. Aloo was also good.

Ambiance was ok ok.Service can be improved.

Overall very good restaurant for Vegetarians.",4,"3 Reviews , 12 Followers",10/12/2018 12:36,0,,"{'food': ['Manchow soup', 'Tomato soup', 'Tandoori mushrooms', 'Tandoori Aloo'], 'drink': []}"

Mathura Vilas,Teja Dandigunta,"Went here for dinner with family to try their notorious south indian thali, only to know that it is served only in the afternoon lunch, greatly disappointed and order north indian thali as there is no other go, and one corn fried rice.
To our delight, north indian thali was awesome, enjoyed every dish present in it, roti, channa curry, paneer, bhendi, and a gobi starter, each one of it delicious. Unable to finish the whole quantity as we were full with more curries. Sweet was very different and scrumptious.
Corn fried rice was equally palatable and went well with curries that came in thali.
Definitely try this pure veg restaurant, when you want a break from all those spicy and masala non veg dishes.
It was deserted on the day we have been here, not sure of the reason for less crowd. Ambiance is also great, service is reasonable and price is also affordable when compared other restaurants.",4,"108 Reviews , 2534 Followers",9/26/2018 23:24,2,,"{'food': ['roti', 'channa curry', 'paneer', 'bhendi'], 'drink': ['corn fried rice']}"
Mathura Vilas,Roshni Aftab,"It was Ganesh Chaturthi and we decided to try something veg special . Having heard so many good reviews about this place , I insisted on going here.

With a pretty decent ambience , this place is very easy to locate . The staff is courteous. We order the special thali which they were serving that day. It was a combination of both North Indian and South Indian thalis . Believe me, the quantity is so much and it is unlimited.

There were around 4-5 curries out of which there was paneer, potato , cauliflower and 2 more . There were 2-3 sweet dishes including kurbani ka meetha. There was daal, sambar, curd and papad. All these were served with rice and poori and lachha paratha. There was also buttermilk as a complimentary drink.

The cost of the thali was 300 plus taxes so it costed around 330 per thali.

For all those non vegetarian buffs like me , u will love this place if you like to experiment with vegetarian options too sometimes . And my vegetarian friends, u will love this place. So just get going and have a foodilicious experience.!",4,"48 Reviews , 135 Followers",9/21/2018 18:54,5,,"{'food': ['paneer', 'potato', 'cauliflower', 'kurbani ka meetha', 'daal', 'sambar', 'curd', 'papad', 'lachha paratha'], 'drink': ['buttermilk']}"
