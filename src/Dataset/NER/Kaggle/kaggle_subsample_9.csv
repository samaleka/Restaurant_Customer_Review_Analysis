Tandoori Food Works,Asha Akunuri,"Very less priced restaurant located in SLN terminus. Ordered tangdi kebab and chicken tikka biriyani .
Tangdi kebab dint meet the expectations . Bit oily and taste was ok but the mint chutney served with it was delicious .
Chicken tikka biriyani was good . Chicken was tender soft and biriyani flavour was good .
Zomato gold is applicable here so it costed only 200 bucks for two . Quite impressed with it . ☺️

Tandoori Food Works,Krishnakanth M,"Very pleasant experience at TFW. The stuffed tangdi kabab was fantastic. Succulent, mildly flavoured and a great salad to go with it. The sizzler biryani was a great innovative touch right down to the well cooked cabbage base. It added a new twist to the term biryani.

Tandoori Food Works,Ha,"Order regular paneer tikka briyani from this place which costs rs 250/-. The briyani was good but the paneer was not so fresh and the quantity was very less. It just fills one person stomach, if someone's appetite is high then they would regret if they order food from this place.

There were two sizes, small (Rs:160/-) and regular (rs:250/-). Obviously one would think that small fills one person and regular would fill two. But No!

Very disappointed with the portion of food that they serve.

The Raitha was really tasty!! I hope they increase the portion for the amount they charge.",3,"86 Reviews , 145 Followers",3/26/2019 2:33,1,,"{'food': ['paneer tikka briyani', 'Raitha'], 'drink': []}"

Ambience was normal and there is nothing to hype about it.. The hotel is not kept clean.. Infact there was an insect in the plate that was given to my first and I had to change my plate eventually.. Service was pretty late considering the items that we ordered..

I ordered chicken majestic and egg biryani .. To be frank, the food was disastrous... U can't put the blame on the time i went as well because it was at 10 in the night.. The starter looked like gravy and tasted very and the briyani had no masala at all..

Starter : chicken majestic

Service is the only terrible thing here. Even during the peek lunch time, they say biryani is over and fresh hundi is awaited, which is terrible.
I mostly do take away here which is a better option.

Al Saba Restaurant,The Greedy Hippo,"The classic example of what happens when all aspects of a restaurant are not taken care of. When your service doesnt compliment the food one serves, it sometimes leads to disaster. Walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at 17 degrees. Agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that. 

Ordered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available. The service time was also too much. I found the waiters to be a little rude. I can sense their awkwardness in serving to an Odia table themselves being odia. 
Neways now coming on to the food. The chicken biriyani does taste good as far as Hyderabadi Biriyani is considered. Other items such as mutton biriyani , paneer masala and dal were also good.

Its a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in Gachibowli, it has a long way to go.

GD’s is a place to go to have a gastronomic experience, not just in terms of the taste but also the theatrics.

GD's,ClickEatXploreYo,"#DoYouKnow? A burger is the short name but in fact called as Hamburger and if you lay down all the hamburgers eaten my Americans only in a year, it circles earth 32 times.!

So why Burger topic now? Because of my recent visit to “GD’s” opp DLF that offers quick bites like, sandwiches, hot dog, grilled chicken starters & most importantly their famous mouthful sized burgers.
Galaxy Burger, no wonder a fast selling pick for its grilled buns crammed with two layered cheesy juicy meat that over salivates your palate. Grilling bun might need a little tweak to avoid chewiness or I am that one unlucky chap! Followed by brilliant #CometTail hot dog with freshness in every bite and decent smokey #AtomicWings with a sweet-tarty (BBD sauce) finish (but a little over grilled).
Though many of them choose this place for their speciality Meat burgers they do have good coverage for Egg/Veg’etarians and heard #AntiMatter burger is a worthy try. Overall paid 480INR.

Value for money yet filling one soul comfortably are the key reasons which can potentially bring you again.

The chicken was grilled properly and tasted fine as well. The only thing I didn't like (I'm a fussy eater) was that the chicken wasn't a breast piece or some sort of filet. It had some loose pieces of fat or skin (which I'm not fond of) and that kinda put me off. A pounded chicken breast without all those ""things"" in between holding the flesh, would have been better. Ultimately I took the burger apart and had the bread and chicken separately. Taste was good though.

GD’s barbecues and burgers is a small shop located exactly opposite to DLF office here they serve juicy and tender barbecues and burgers.
The burgers made here are really good they marinate the chicken with desi spices and herbs, they cook the chicken in such a way that it is tender and juicy.
This is not a place where you can sit with your friends and have a bite I recommend this place only if you’re Street food lover and planning to grab something to eat on the go.
Each burger at this place costs around Rs.150-Rs.200.

These uber tasty charcoal grilled burgers are absolute food nirvana. The soft and tender chicken breast well coated with local desi masala(marinated ) are grilled till they turn golden brown. A double slice of the grilled breast serves as the filling for galactic burger; which is my personal favouriteThe burger buns are soft and sweet.

They have other options too like hotdog and sandwiches which are damn tasty. Basically their USP is the grilling process of marinated chicken breast which makes them uncontested winners of best burgers in cyberabad. The place is in mid of bustling DLF area which makes the place pretty accessible. You may have to be patient enough to catch hold of your burgers as it takes minimum 15 minimum to grill the patty. Must visit place for mouth watering burgers.",5,"140 Reviews , 931 Followers",9/2/2018 14:11,1,,"{'food': ['chicken burger', 'hotdog', 'sandwiches'], 'drink': []}"
GD's,Abhilash Pradhan (AbTheFoodie),"A hidden jewel serving probably the best burgers in Hyderabad and that too at a steal of a price.

You probably wouldn't notice this joint infront of DLF Hyderabad but for the crowd that throng during evening hours . And if you have had a burger or a hot dog here and there's simply no place you can go to satisfy the cravings they create .

Do try their cosmic burger, paneer hot dog, paneer burger.

The sauces that they put with the cheese is lipsmacking.

I have been a fan and I'm a regular here. Try and you won't be disappointed.

GD's,Ishna Rawlani,"A hidden treasure, you have to travel across to eat these heavenly burgers. A small place situated in DLF,
GD's is a very renowned place famous among people who work in the IT hub and also students in the
same area. You can park your car, and explore this joyous ride. They have burgers like never before, all
named after the galaxy, stars and sky. GD is himself who got these after a lot of research and planned to
ditch his corporate job to start a journey with burgers, why? Because he absolutely loves them. When
you head there, place your order, it takes a min hiimum of 20 minutes for your burgers to arrive as they
prepare all fresh on the live grill in front of you. The burgers are vegetarian, chicken, paneer, fish and
more that is grilled to perfection and topped it with your chosen flavours off the menu. The bread is soft
and straight out of the oven. They also have sandwiches, starters and hotdogs! Try the Mercury, it’s all
chicken strips with melted Creamy cheese, the perfect burger for a rainy day. The Venus if you are a
lamb fan, or the Milky Way if you love chicken with a lot of Mayo. They also have Neptune, made in
Ferrero nuts, chicken and cheese. There is a special dip you will be served with and it’s out of the world!",4,"46 Reviews , 152 Followers",8/24/2018 22:59,0,,"{'food': ['burgers', 'sandwiches', 'starters', 'hotdogs'], 'drink': []}"

Just open your mouth it instantly becomes a bulb and one more thing which saved me, while I was on a pitch black road three men approached inorder to mugg as soon as I opened my mouth they ran away the luminosity of my teeth was around the same as the sun's.P.s: I used pepsodent for better results P.s.s I used this super power on my solar water heater.

It's was exactly at 12.30 noon when we entered restaurant and found there was hardly any one. Outside landscape, place for sitting is very good. There is in-house place with AC as well. We chose inside as it was already too hot. Ambience is descent and nothing very special, but is good.

Food we kept it simple as Nawabi Chicken Kebab which was special on the day we visited and Chicken Biryani. Kebabs were really nice. Biryani was like fine. Not so very delicious at same time it's not bad. Service is fast.

While if you ask me will you visit the place again, I might start thinking as I found place outside more interesting than the food. That does not serve purpose. So, I am sure you got answer.

Interesting was by time the clock ticked 12.45noon, my goodness entire place was filled with people and many we're waiting... That made us think, probably there is something else special about this place which we didn't order...

Service- The parcel came in around 10 minutes later than estimated. The delivery boy called once he was outside our society. 3/5

Presentation/Packaging- It was a usual packing. Nothing extraordinary nor anything bad about it. 3/5

Food- Food was fine but what really killed my appetite for it was the amount of chillies added. We tried the following-:

Paneer Pulao- It had a nice quantity, sufficient for two. There were average number of paneer pieces. It tasted quite yum. The masala was ample inside. Too spicy which killed it's essence. 3.5/5

Gobi 65- A good quantity for two, it tasted like a typical fried Gobi. Nothing extraordinary, the usual. 3/5

Will I order from here again? I will only if they decrease the spice level. Despite mentioning it clearly as an extra special instruction, it was supremely spicy which made me fill my stomach with water.",3,"316 Reviews , 1156 Followers",7/8/2018 16:16,2,,"{'food': ['Paneer Pulao', 'Gobi 65'], 'drink': []}"

T Grill,Rajesh Krishnan,"A randomly sudden decision took me and a couple of my colleagues to this place on a weekday lunch. we were unsure of our choice when we saw a few people sitting under the open huts and dining in the heat wave. But the moment I opened what seemed like a kitchen door, I was thrown aback to see 100s of people belting some South Indian meat. Man, this place is an oasis in the Puppalguda desert!
We being mutton lovers, ordered a nalli starter and charcoal mutton chops. looking at the crowd we were mentally prepared to go back to office in the evening post chai break but the waiter promptly brought the food in less than 10 minutes with a scalpel like tool with which we were to operate the nalli. Our eyes shone. The nalli did not disappoint us. we then dug into the chops. all my hours spent in drooling at pork ribs on YouTube were redeemed. this mutton chops did the deed. the meat wasn't the slimy, fatty kind melting off the bones, but was the perfectly grilled meat willing to separate from the ribs at our mildest effort. we were already dreaming of another plate but decided against it in the best interests of our bellies. then came the main course - rotis, mamasam pachadi and chicken biriyani. first bite of the mamasam pachadi threw our chairs back by 5 feet. we decided to ask the waiter to pack the biriyani and order another round of rotis to honour the pachadi. for a person who consciously keeps away from gongura chutneys, this one which clearly had gongura was just perfectly sour - a bit more sour and I wouldn't have cared to write this review. the meat was invisible. we had to spot a narrow bone in the pachadi to even know there was mutton. it was just mystically Omni present in the meat. I guess this is what you would call divine food.

T Grill,Raghunatha Reddy Ontikommu,"On the way back home from Mrugavani National Park, had a stop here for lunch. I really felt the present state of this place like lot of things gone missing. First impression, no one at the parking to guide or coordinate it, all were parked zigzag, welcomed by foul odour at that point.
Huge place, but no one seem to let us know of how to proceed further, like where to sit or dine, especially if it was first time like me. Initially noticed an outdoor seating, organized perfectly under hut shape units spread across the whole area with vibrant chairs and tables. Felt like scorching sun breeze wouldn't make us withstand it for quite long and so thought not an good idea to have lunch outdoors, also felt kitchen exhaust smoke widespread. No one cared to guide until I personally asked of any indoor is available.
So shifted to inside dining room, great relief finding at a corner a place for us. Our order was Veg platter - not worth price, taste, quantity. Jumbo chicken Biryani - evenly cooked, tender chicken, not so flavorful, Mutton Biryani is good.
Service lag, may be of huge rush. Missing fine dine features, asked for finger bowl but got an answer to wash hands outside.
Village back drop artifact, greenery are little bit saviors. May be at evening hours, outdoor seating could be good choice. Anyway no thrill at T grill.",3,"104 Reviews , 2833 Followers",3/15/2018 11:22,3,,"{'food': ['Veg platter', 'Jumbo chicken Biryani', 'Mutton Biryani'], 'drink': []}"

Momos Delight,Ritwik Borgohain,"I ordered the steamed chicken and fried chicken momos.
The momos are pretty terrible, especially considering how much they are asking for it. I've had cheaper and better momos from roadside vendors.They also made my stomach upset which is a sure sign of them serving old and unhygienic food since even the roadside momos have never done this to me.

I would definitely steer clear of this place, especially if you have ever had even half decent momos from anywhere else.  Also this is the first time someone has given mayo with momos and I can confirm that the combination is as disgusting as it sounds.If you have poor taste in food or have a stomach made of iron, then sure, go ahead and order from this farce of a momo joint.

Arrived nice and hot and on time

Problem- the fried kurkure felt fried on stale oil, the coating was really thick tasted more of the oil coating than anything inside.

Sauce was mayo and red sauce. I am not sure how ppl eat mayo with momos? Antways i tried the red sauce , thinking that sauce may help with thick coating and oil, sauce was realy confusing zero taste just sodium thats it!

It tasted like it was not freshly made. The filling was not satisfying at all. Moreover the salt was a bit over the top.

Veg steamed momos:The packaging was real bad and u cud see momos out of the silver foil box.The filling of the momo wasnt really pleasing and was not tasty enuf to swat my mood.The veggies seemed to be over burnt and they didnt smell good either.The schezwan chutney that they usually setve with momos was more lookinglike tomato ketchup and the quantity was so lil that it cud just suffice 1 momo.

Momos Delight,Rajat Goel ✳️,"A small kiosk among the many eateries opposite the DLF building. A friend recommended this place as authentic Delhi style Momos, so stopped by.

At around 9pm, only steamed chicken Momos (60/5) were available. They were absolutely steamy hot, soft and delicious. Inside the thin Momo skin, was a large filling of minced chicken meat, minimal veggies. Just perfect.

Momos were served with a nice spicy and tangy red chilly chutney, and a dollop of mayonnaise, that I left. Somehow the combination of Momos and Mayo didn't work for me.

They have crusted 'Kurkure' momos that weren't available, but hope to try them sometime later!

A must visit place for all the chocolate lovers!!

I tried dark chocolate fondue. The dark chocolate was flavourful, thick and glossy. The dips were very well coherent with the chocolate and they are all 100% eggless!

Potato wedges poutine was another dish that I loved the most and you should not miss this! It has white sauce pasta base with well seasoned potato wedges!

The pancakes were fulffy and are perfect when paired with hot chocolate!

Service - was bit slow as we went around 10 pm but the staff is really attentive !

Going through their super extensive menu would probably make you tired, but the service is so appalling, probably you’ll die of hunger waiting for your order to arrive. The place is cosy enough for you to carry a laptop and spend a couple hours on an assignment. I’d recommend you do that cause anyway, they deliver orders after forever. 🙈

As the name goes, I’ve always had it in my mind to relate this place to a dessert bar. And hence, I’ve never tried the savoury items offered here. But I’ve heard they have a good offering among sandwiches and nachos. So that would keep my review limited only to the sweet dishes. 🙂

The Toblerone Shake and the Kitkat Shake are the shizzz. So full of the taste- actually well prepared. The chocolate brownie is really a waste of money: you’ve probably had much better brownies all over Hyderabad. 😝

Ambiance is nice and calm they have separate kids play area and a party hall for celebrations. The place can easily accommodate 50 to 70 people. Coming to food we ordered 1. Garden fresh sandwich it was really loaded with some nice veggies and perfect amount of cheese and toasted to perfection 2. The veg cheese sandwich again it was yummy and had roasted mushrooms to go with onion and cheese. 3. Oreo cookie shake - Sweetness was just adequate and flavour was awesome as well though they can do something with the thickness of it as it was way watery for my liking.

American Wild Wings,Karthik Sreeram,"found them on Zomato website, a very interesting to say that this restaurant carved a niche in serving juicy  chicken wings with wide spread of 10 to 12 sauces especially Texas BBQ, Spicy garlic too yummy and spicy like Original hot and Amazon wild comes in to top of mind. Did ordered their bulk wings of 20 pieces and chicken drum sticks tossed with theses sauces were amazing. Dyna pasta served here  with white sauce is a perfect balance with a little spicy. Over all they have apt combination of mojitos like lemonade and strawberry one can have a very good combo. Biryanis served here us very special like Wings Biryani and drum sticks have a large quantity matched quality as well. over all its a best and only to discover a new taste of their popular chicken wings at a very reasonable place.",5,1 Review,5/25/2019 16:02,0,,"{'food': ['chicken wings', 'chicken drum sticks', 'dyna pasta'], 'drink': ['mojitos', 'lemonade', 'strawberry']}"
American Wild Wings,Pushpendra Singh,"Out of hunger and trust on the restaurant I ordered a chicken burger from American wild wings, Gachibowli hoping it would be tasty and healthy but the kind of service i recieved was really pathetic. At first the restaurant took almost 40 mins to prepare just a small chicken burger, i tried calling restaurant about the update and they weren't even responsive, didn't answer any of my call. I kept my patience and waited for the order to arrive. aftr receiving the order what i saw was really a bad experience. The french fries that I used to get always were replaced by some oily, smelly, rotten potato pakodis. Not just that I hoped my burger to be nice but it was again a big disappointment. The very first bite of it tasted really bad. Chicken seemed fried to be in very bad oil and smelled filthy. I had to throw it after my first three bites. And then after sometime i even started Having pain in my stomach . This particular experience of mine was very disappointing with american wild wings.

American Wild Wings,Ritwika Dash,"So on my latest visit to this amazing American themed place, i had an amazing experience. We kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. There were desi and videshi khaana both.
We started off with the forte of this place ,WINGS. We had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. I personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. Chicken was rightly done in every single dish. Preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. The only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.
There were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings❤️😍
.
Coming to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks ❤️
.
The fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. It was an instant favorite.
.
Kuch desi khaana we had in there were Gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. Shocked? Well hum bhi hue the. But lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best ❤️❤️ A must try.
.
.
Some snacks we had in there were Chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. The nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. 😍 The popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. Otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .

American Wild Wings,Ammar KanchWala,"*Visit By Invite*

Located in a buzy spot, this joint has definitely some good food to offer.

We tried a host of items from the menu. Starting off with Chicken Nuggets which were the show stopper. Next up we had Chicken wings, which to be honest didn't excite us too much apart from the barbeque chicken wings.

Fried Chicken burger had a tender and juicy patty served along some good french fries. Chicken popcorn were a major disappointment and the raw material used didn't look fresh. Chicken drumsticks gave nice visual as well as taste appeal. To keep the show running, we had caesar salad on the side which definetly requires a revamp and the joint can play with salad dressings, spices rather than having it served just with mayo.

In the end, we had Biryani which gets served under the brand of Fireblast Biryani. This biryani has still a long way to go and in order to beat the best of Biryani's in town need some more experiments with flavors.

While food here is decent, the ambiance requires immideat attention. The entrace was cluttered and the back of counter was clogged with unwanted items. A bit of touch up in both food and ambiance can turn this into a 5 star rating experience. #TheWandererFoodies

American Wild Wings,Raj Kumar,"Hello Hyderabad..!!!!!My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the  awesome food court around Hitech City and Gachibowli. it is  located near the DLF signals and beside Creamstone Gachibowli above Thick Shakes. 
The ambiance is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.

The menu design with array spans of Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Red hot roasted Chicken Wings  ❤️ - Juicy chicken wings are coated and fried along with Mexican                                                                   Jerk Suces Yummy unforgettable. 

Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.

Drum Stick Dum Biryani-
OMG very different as i never experienced trust me  you guys will fall in love with it. 
Drum Sticks ❤️ - Nachos topped with red sauce and I JUST  loved it.  
Combos ❤️ - The true fact i have ever seen even in KFC, Mc-Donald's such awesome combi within a convincing budget. loved it. 

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out all kinds biryanis so far The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mock-tails. Sluches chocolate flav is an absolute delight! Also a fan of coke float.

American Wild Wings,Tania Sahu(Mrsfoodieglobetrotter),"It's hard to find places which give delivery upto morning 4am. American Wild wings is one of them. It's just beside Creamstone, Gachibowli. They deliver chicken wings,salad,popcorn,fries,biriyani and Andhra style chicken from evening till morning . They have a decent seating arrangement too. For chicken wings, you got almost 10/12 sauces to choose upon. Among them my favorite are Texas BBQ and Mexican jerk. Also tried their strawberry mocktail which was refreshing. Their biriyani comes with drumsticks / wings. Tried the drumstick biriyani. Chicken were well spicy and well with Curry leaves ( Andhra style). Service,ambience and prices all were decent. Nothing fancy to be expected.
So if you are planning to have something beforig indulging urself in Creamstone visit here.

I was there with my wife for dinner and we had a delightful time as we both love Chicken Wings. The various Sauces on offer is amazing. We tried Pattaya Thai, Texas BBQ, Mexican Jerk, Original Hot and Amazon Wild. I liked BBQ and Original Hot, both were exceptional. We then moved on to Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Fried Burger and Grilled Chicken Salad. Nuggets were amazing, crispy and soft while Burger and Salad were delicious as well.

We had this with a few soft drinks and mocktails, namely Lemonade and Mango. Both were pretty good but can be improved.

Service was great. We were very well taken care by Mr Srinivas, the branch manager. Ambience is okay and needs to be worked upon a bit being an upcoming fast-food joint.

American Wild Wings,Vamshi Puli,"I absolutely love chicken wings so I had to try this new place in Gachibowli as I’ve heard about it from a few friends.

I’ve been to this place with a group of foodie friends.
This is a small outlet located on the first floor ,right above dirty burgers.
The place can host upto 30 pax max.
The place was bright and colourful with good lights all over the place.



Food:
We tried different sauces:
The Texas bbq ,spicy garlic ,Pattaya Thai ,original hot ,Mexican jerk and Amazon wild.
All of the wings were delicious and had varying spiciness.
The wings were slightly crispy outside and soft inside,just the way I like them to be.

Next we were served with chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn.
The best munching dish I love till date are the chicken nuggets.
They tasted really good and were tastier than expected.
The nuggets were my favourite.

The chicken popcorn was not that great.
The presentation was not at all good and the chicken was very chewy.
Need to improve this.

Surprisingly the menu had biryani in it.
We tried their wings dim biryani .
The biryani was not that proper Hyderabadi biryani but had a good taste .
They served a really good quantity of biryani.

The management has to improve in their food presentations.

American Wild Wings,Tavleen Kaur Gandhi,"American Wild Wings = Amazing Wings
I happened to visit this place yesterday for dinner. Well who doesn't like chicken wings? I love wings so wanted to check out this place.
It's a small cozy place, giving cafe feels. Interiors are decent and so is the seating. There aren't any sections as the place is streched longitudinaly. They have self service system.
Coming to food and menu,
The menu looks quite economical with respect to the portion size of the food and taste. So it is value for money. The only thing which needs improvement is the presentation of the dishes.
Taste, quantity and price are all up to the mark.
I tried their signature sauces for the mains, texas bbq, Pattaya thai, spicy garlic, original hot, Mexican jerk and Amazon wild. To my surprise all the wings were delicious specially the bbq and original hot, loved them.
Tried out the chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken... Among which nuggets were really good but chicken popcorn needs some improvement.
The menu seems interesting as they also serve biryani, not the authentic one but related to their respective genre, like wings dum biryani and drumsticks dum biryani. The quantity of chicken in the biryani was heavy and it tasted good too. Also had the chef special gongura chicken which was not on the menu. It was the star of the evening though, tatse, texture everything was perfect.
Also had a ceaser salad which required more dressing and flavour. Had fried chicken burger too, which was tasty and ya tastier than the KFC burger.
Overall the place is affordable and nice. The hospitality was very nice. Thanks Mr. Srinivas, you were always up your feet and served us well. The staff is humble and friendly.

American Wild Wings,Uma,"A great hangout place for the IT employees and with with really reasonable prices.

Peaceful ambience with no much of chaos in the place.

Order was taken as per our wishlist and made the items accordingly with the required spicyness and etc.

We had chicken fry , chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn and then boneless chicken biryani which were served really very hot and tasty.

Overall a very comfortable place with affordable prices and quality food.

American Wild Wings,Salwa Rahman,"American Wild Wings is a very affordable place which serves quality wings. Located in Gachibowli main road, just beside creamstone, it is a place to relish Chicken Wings.

I tried out their Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Salad, Chicken Fried Burger and Various Chicken Wings. The sauce I loved the most was BBQ Chicken Wings. Chicken Nuggets were amazing as well.

We tried their Lemonade and Mango Mojito, they were okay but can be improved. The service by Mr Srinivas is quick and he is very understanding. Ambience needs a bit of touch up here and there especially at the entrance.

This place is a must try for their Wings and Nuggets.",5,"3 Reviews , 1 Follower",5/14/2019 20:48,5,,"{'food': ['Chicken Wings', 'Chicken Nuggets', 'Chicken Fried Burger'], 'drink': ['Lemonade', 'Mango Mojito']}"
American Wild Wings,Bharti Mehta,"Rating - 3.5

Visited this place on a Friday evening. The interiors are okayish, they need to work alot upon that.

Now coming to food:

We tried their wings in 8-9 different sauces. Most of them were really good and the chicken was fresh and meat fell off the bone.

My personal favorite was Mexican jerk, Barbeque and Konaseema. Though the sauces can be reduced a little.

Also the lemon garlic and original hot need to be improved. The lemon garlic had so much oil in it and the original hot tasted nothing but red chilli powder.

We also ordered Virgin Mojito which was very very sweet for our palate.

The Chicken Caesar salad was a big disappointment as it was full of lettuce and sauces. The chicken was very chewy.

We also ordered Chicken Biryani and Patiala Chicken.

The biryani was good but had a lot of oil in it. Meat was fresh and tender.

Patiala Chicken had good flavors but alot of masala in it.

Also the Chicken Popcorn can be completely avoided as the chicken is very rubbery and needs alot of improvement.

The white sauce pasta again was very sweet for our liking.

Overall this place needs alot of improvement but you can definitely try out their wings as they are good and economically priced.",4,"84 Reviews , 387 Followers",5/14/2019 14:12,22,,"{'food': ['wings', 'Mexican jerk', 'Barbeque', 'Konaseema', 'Chicken Caesar salad', 'Chicken Biryani', 'Patiala Chicken', 'Chicken Popcorn', 'white sauce pasta'], 'drink': ['Virgin Mojito']}"
American Wild Wings,Shreshth Malhotra,"American Wild Wings is another fast food joint located amidst the Cream Stone outlet of Gachibowli. The place is open and has an ideal sitting space for 20-30 people. Went there with my friends to try out their food. I found their Ambiance quite ordinary and I felt it can get some makeover.

Starting with their appetizers, We first tried out their in house Chicken wings. So, the chicken wings served over here are classified into various types. They offer a wide range of sauces for their wings ranging from classic Texas BBQ, Pattaya Thai, Spicy Garlic, Amazon wild etc.

My personal favorite of the lot had to be Original hot Chicken wings and Mexican wild Chicken wings. The wings were super juicy and delicious. However, I also feel that the sauce content was too much for the wings which can be slightly reduced in order to make it taste perfect.

Next up, we had their Classic Chicken Nuggets and Popcorn Chicken. The nuggets were super tasty and very much similar to what we usually get to eat at all fast food outlets. The Popcorn chicken was chewy. It requires serious attention and changes.

For mains, the place has also introduced authentic Indian dishes such as Chicken Biryani with Salan, Raita and Gongura Chicken. The Gongura Chicken was an absolute relish. To my surprise, the meat fell of the bone quite nicely and it worked really nicely with the clean flavors of the Biryani.

Thanks for a wonderful time Mr. Srinivas. Moreover, this place is comparatively quite pocket friendly and can be given a shot for their Chicken Wings anyday.

American Wild Wings,Suparna Banerjee,"They say ""count your chicken before they hatch"" and this weekend I did almost that. Hehehe, well, we were counting them before having it 😆🍗😉.

Our visit was an invite for a complimentary lunch by Mr. Srinivas Lanka incharge of the restaurant operations, management and marketing. This place on a main location of Gachibowli, Hyderabad with a dine-in. They offer American Cuisine for 🐔🐓🍗 chicken lovers and as the name suggests they specialise in Chicken Wings.

We got some thirst-quenching mojito mocktails- lemonade, orange and strawberry. They also offer slushies but was not available at that time. Moving on as suggested we ordered the wings with 4 kinds of sauces- Pattaya Thai, Spicy Garlic, Texas BBQ and Mexican Jerk (👈 this one was my favourite). They were slightly crispy on outside and juicy on the inside.

Pattaya Thai- spicy sauce with coarse texture
Spicy Garlic- Finely chopped garlic and chilli flakes sauce
Texas BBQ- the same old barbecue sauce with sweet and savoury taste and a hit of chilli. 
Mexican Jerk- a sweet and spicy smooth textured sauce that won my 💓.  

We also ordered for Popcorn Chicken which was crispy fried but not very impressive, Original Patty burger which was quite simple (no veggies in it, not even the basic ones like- tomato, onion rings or lettuce) and was served pretty hot with French fries so be careful when you take a bite. We also ordered for Asian (fried) Chicken Salad but was served with Caesar Chicken salad 🥗, which was little disappointing to taste as well.

You can definitely visit this place on Fridays and Saturdays for drinks (liquor) as well. So here is my rating on this-  

Food- 4/5 (this is just for the chicken wings alone)
Service- 3.5/5 (little slow but courteous staff)
Ambience- 3/5 (nice and decent)

Overall I would like to rate it 3.8/5 as there is lot of scope for improvement in future.

American Wild Wings,Anvith Devulapally,"We happened to visit American Wild Wings on a Friday evening and the place was desolated. The place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept.

We started with a lemon mojito. Though refreshing, it was a tad too sweet for my liking. We thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately, our Chicken Ceasar salad was drenched in dressing. It almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise.

Then came in an array of wings, each with their own signature sauces. We tried 9 different sauces and liked most of them. All the wings were fried well and had a good crunch. Of all the sauces, my top picks were there barbeque, konaseema amd mexican jerk. Barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio, the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper, coriander and coconut, and the Mexican jerk had a garlicky peri-peri kind of flavor. Must try sauces! While these sauces were good, few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing. The lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate. The original hot didn't taste of anything but spice and bitterness. They also have a sauce names Atomic - the hottest on their menu. It was indeed very hot for my liking. We also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent. Chicken nuggets were good. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Though their USP is wings, they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving Biryanis, fried rice and a few curries. We tried their chicken fry-piece biryani and it had a unique flavor. The meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt, but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well. Chicken Punjabi, a sarson ka saag version was actually really good. It had the perfect saag flavor. Again, too oily.

Upon their suggestion, we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn, both of which were terrible. The pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard. Stay away!

Another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes. The first serving of our wings was dead cold. When brought to their notice, the second serving was mouth-burning hot. The biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl. The bowl was so hot, we couldn't even pick it to put the food in our plates.

Overall, they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve. The quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes, serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon. They also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds. Price wise, they are pretty pocket friendly!

American Wild Wings,George B.,"I was invited by Mr. Srinivas, the man in charge at AWW for a tasting lunch session, the food was complimentary from their side. I had a nice afternoon there. The restaurant is very well placed in Gachibowli, just near Karachi Bakery on Old Mumbai Highway.

The best part of the experience (beside the wonderful time spent with Mr. Srinivas) was the food. I tasted their chicken nuggets, caesar salad, different types of chicken wings and I took a parcel of grilled chicken burger with fries.
- I really encourage everyone to try their wings! I had texas bbq sauce, parmesan and garlic, mexican and lemon pepper sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed every style. The wings were juicy and tender, yammm.
- Caesar salad was very nicely dressed, nice chunks of chicken there and the croutons made the dish complete.
- The burger was definitely above the average burgers you have in the city. The burger patty was a real burger patty not some sweet bun.
- Nuggets were regular, deep fried with mayo, nothing special here, just a decent starter.
More of that, I checked their menu and the prices are really reasonable!

Aside the good food, there is some room for improvement. The place should be better maintained. At the entrance door there was a bit of mess and the cleanliness is not their strongest point. The order and cash counter side looks more like a storage area with boxes and bags over there. The tables, floors and windows should be spotless because this restaurant really has potential! And also I would suggest to have a better quality cutlery because the plastic fork given was horrible, it bended every each time I tried to pick some food. If they will focus a bit more on maintenance and details it can be a busy place because definitely the food is good.

Overall a reasonable priced restaurant with good food and some room for improvement in the ambiance area. But definitely recommended for a least a try!

I ordered Chicken Burger + Fries + Wings + Soft drink combo through Zomato, and received my order fairly quickly. However,
(1) Fries were totally cold and soggy. 
(2) Burger was average - tasted like the low-end 40 rupees burger at McDonalds.
(3) Wings were either burnt or double-fried. There were parts of the thick coating which were burnt black - and they perhaps tried to fix it by adding too much sauce on the top.

Looking at other reviews it feels like it might be once-in-a-while exception but they ruined my Monday Lunch!

American Wild Wings,Pramit Bandyopadhyay,"I ordered the signature chicken wings through zomato, which is 1xfrench fries, 6x chicken wings, and one coke(350ml).
Quantity was satisfactory.
Packaging of the food was good. I really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. Some may call it excessive packaging however.
The fries were warm and well salted. But they were not crispy. This could be the fault of delivery, so I am not upset. Only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
The wings were covered in brown gravy. I was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. While the wings were certainly not bad, I did not enjoy it very much.
I would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself.",4,"11 Reviews , 1 Follower",10/8/2018 14:03,0,,"{'food': ['1xfrench fries', '6x chicken wings'], 'drink': ['one coke(350ml)']}"

Domino's Pizza,Upasana Motani,"I have ordered from Dominos all my life, but no store has ever been this bad.
The order arrived in 45 mins, all my food had completely cooled down.
I asked the delivery boy about their 30 mins policy, and he gave a very casual answer saying ""ma'am parking me late hogya, jaane do"" I tried to argue saying that its not my problem and he agreed to give me a 300 rs refund. I asked him to do it at the moment and he said, his manager is busy so it cant be done right now but he assured me that it will be done. 

I talked to his manager on the phone, and he completely denied my refund. 
He didn't care about customer service, he talked very rudely, and he said he's not going to follow the policy. He also said I don't care if you accept the order or return it.
(If this was the case, why did the delivery boy ensure my refund and tried to run off?)

People like this don't deserve to be a part of DOMINOS.
They're completely ruining the franchise image.",1,3 Reviews,5/18/2019 3:00,0,,

Domino's Pizza,Moonis Ahmed,"Ordered a pizza, garlic bread and other stuff on 14th Feb at 9 pm through Zomato. ZOMATO shows order is in the kitchen. But no call, no delivery even by 10.15 pm. The branch number on Zomato was incorrect. Called up Dominos hotline and they said they'll reach out to the branch and they'll call back. Waited for 15 min. No call back. Called the hotline again and the guy puts me on hold while he reaches out to the branch. 5 min later i am disconnected. Called up again and the same message that they will reach out to the branch is thrown on my face. Finally had it enough and asked them to cancel my order and refund the money.

I anyway don't eat Dominos pizza given some pretty bad prior experience. But ordered on my wife's insistence. Congratulations. Now even my wife doesn't want to order Dominos ever again. :)

1. Zomato doesn't have any view on what the restaurant is doing with the order. The system automatically said food is being prepared when clearly the restaurant has no clue on the order.

2. Dominos hotline is worthless. No clue on if their branch actually has a working phone or not.",1,"160 Reviews , 754 Followers",2/15/2019 14:31,0,,"{'food': ['pizza', 'garlic bread'], 'drink': []}"
