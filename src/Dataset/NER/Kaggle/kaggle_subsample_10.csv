I complained to the waiter who said thats the way they make it, yet he offered to replace with Chicken Schezwan noodles which I declined, as I wasn't sure to further ruin my taste n appetite. Cocktails were decent, non-veg platter was ok ok, couldn't differentiate between the taste in tikkas.

Service is very very slow even on a weekday. It took so much time for kababs to come.

Often they say, if you arrive late, make it grand. We hoped the food will be awesome as they might took so much time to prepare it. But alas! the food is disgusting!

Not recommended at all. Go only if you're getting offer like more than 60% off.. Otherwise complete waste of money!",1,1 Review,5/7/2019 18:07,0,,"{'food': ['kababs'], 'drink': []}"

Service : very very slow even on a weekday. Seems kitchen is highly understaffed.

Food: Pathetic! I am living in Hyderabad for last 10 years. I haven't had so pathetic kababs here in Hyderabad, like what I got at arena eleven.

Overall a BIG NO. Please don't waste your money here.

1. Ordered fish lemon pepper kabab.. It was too salty.

2. Ordered chicken tikka kabab. You can't even chew the chickn pieces, it was so hard & tasteless.

Arena Eleven,Tanya Karanjai,"Arena eleven sports bar

IPl is here and whats better way to enjoy it than watching it in a sports bar! There aren't many sports bar around and Arena Eleven is the swankiest ones in town. Located in the SNL terminal , this is the best destination if you are a sports fan.

AMBIENCE (4/5): The seating space is quite big with multiple screens with sports channels playing on every wall and corner. They have a nice wooden furniture which also adds to the asthetics of the place. Beautifully designed restro, Arena Eleven has all glass walls and is perfect to have a city view while munching on your food. They have some good tracks playing which I liked as well.They have indoor as well as outdoor seating.Outdoor seating us just opposite to landscape of trees and was bliss to enjoy it as the rain drops poured down the city.

FOOD AND BEVERAGES ( 4/5) :

You can opt for either ala carte or buffet.The place has both options.

Mocktails and cocktails : In mocktails we had non alcoholic sangria which was the best drink amonst all we tried. This had grape juice , with fresh apple and bartenders mix. Then we tried Mint Julep which was fresh otange wedges with mint,lime and orange juice. It was decent.Zen Zero was the one we tried next which had lemon chunks ,brown sugar ,ginger and fresh mint topped with cola. It was nothing special and was too sweet.Virgin mojito was as it should be.

In cocktails we tried Old Fashioned which had bourbon with sugar and bitters. This one was a little too concentrated and strong for me.next we had Kentucky apple cinnamon which had burbon whiskey infused with apple juice and Cinnamon. It was a delightfull drink.Then was the cucumber cooler which had gin infused with cucumber and sour mix. This drink did not appeal to my taste as was too much of cucumber taste.

Food:

1. Veg manchaow soup : The soup did not appeal my pallate . It was moreovee tasting like rasam than a Chinese soup.

2. Tandoor items : we had some tandoori chicken legs and some chicken tikkas which were really well prepared and chicken quality was also good.

3. Tandoori non veg sizzler : This was a surprise which sizzling mixed tendoori items like chicken tikka , fish tikka .it was absolutely delighfull.

4.Tandoori veg sizzler : This had paneer tikka,veg seekh kabab.the veg seekh kabab was dry and lacked in flavour.

5. Hot wings : The hot wings were sweet to taste where as ,as the name itself suggests it should be hot and spicy. This was a disappointing one

6.Tandoori chicken tandri : Tandoori chicken tandri was tender and juicy and masalas were nicely amalgamated with the chicken peices.

7. Masala Fries : This is a very new concept which I tried for the first time. The masala fries were served with chopped onions.It was really good and we couldn't stop at one or two.

8.Chilli fish : chilli fish was a nicely tossed fish in oriental style.

8. Chicken Tikka Pizza : chicken tikka pizza was absolutely scrumptious toppings. This was a thin crust pizza with indianised way of toppings and pizza sauce. The crust though was too hard and felt as if not freshly baked.

9. Chicken seekh kabab : I absolutely loved the seekh kababs which had a nice flavours of soices coming through.

10. Veg seekh kabab : the veg seekh kqbabs felt dry and lacked flavours.could be better.

11. Chicken green curry and steamed rice : the chicken green curry was absolutely divine to eyes. The consistency was also creamy. The taste though was slightly to the sweeter side which dint give the balanced flavour.

12. Chicken tikka biryani ( from the buffet) : absolutely yummy this biryani was the one eveeyone has there eyes on from the veey beginning. The hot steaming biryani was spicy and the lipsmacking tikkas along gave a nice taste overall.

DESSERTS

1. Gajar ka halwa : I absolutely loved the gajar ka halwa. Warm halwa just melted in the mouth and with the icecream along ,it felt divine.

2. Kheer : the kheer was also nice and gave a cery homely taste.

The place is really nominal with good food. With this rate charged and the sports add on it provides,this place is absolutely recommended.",4,"44 Reviews , 133 Followers",5/1/2019 21:54,10,,"{'food': ['Veg manchaow soup', 'Tandoor items', 'Tandoori non veg sizzler', 'Tandoori veg sizzler', 'Hot wings', 'Tandoori chicken tandri', 'Masala Fries', 'Chilli fish', 'Chicken Tikka Pizza', 'Chicken seekh kabab', 'Chicken green curry and steamed rice', 'Chicken tikka biryani (from the buffet)'], 'drink': ['Mocktails', 'Cocktails']}"

Ambaince was good with outdoor and indoor seating.

Located in the sln terminus mall in level 3, cozy ambience well set up of giant screens and LED screens all over the restaurant as you cannot miss any single action of your sorts while eating the delicious kebabs and sizzlers. A pocket friendly restaurant with awesome food menu.

I have been there on multiple times once with a friend and also by a invite. Both of my experiences are much better then the before one.

My favorites at Arena eleven are the kebab sizzling platters, the assorted sizzling platters are so succulent and tasty with the hot sizzle.

I Love the chicken pizza the thin crust and the toppings are really good.

Thai Green Curry with steam rice are one of my favorite, but just they need to be little consistent.

Chicken tikka biryani is the USP of arena eleven menu, it's really too good in taste and the quality.

I had the best non alcoholic Sangria here. It was the best so far, must try this.

Arena eleven has very good and economical lunch buffet, the spread is much worth at price of Rs: 550/-

Arena Eleven,Bharti Mehta,"Visited Arena 11 for a Sunday Branch. It was Easter Sunday and the place was packed. Also, since the IPL season is on, this sports themed restaurant was on our visit list.

The have Sunday Buffet Brunch and the menu is very compact but most of the items in buffet were delicious. Though the presentation can be improved alot.

We also tasted their ala carte menu, a few of the items were good but their isn't much consistency with their dishes.

At once it will be amazing but the other time it can be below par.

Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka, Honey Chilli Chicken Wings and Tangri Kebab were served.

The Lemon Fish Tikka and Tangdi Kebab were good but Honey Chilli Chicken Wings were too sweet for my palate.

The Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries were good.

In buffet, the Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani stood out.

Also gajar ka halwa in desserts was great.

Arena Eleven,Kamran Hussain Khan (Intensefoodcravingsblog),"Arena Eleven is a sports bar ,located at the plush and financial province of Hitec city .There is plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor. The menu is extensive. There is plenty of waitstaff. Our waitress frequently stopped by to make sure we were satisfied, and refilled soda and water drinks without being requested to.
We say outside seating gives you are brief view of the surrounding areas and the view is simply beautiful playing. The music selections were good, but not too loud.
The portions were very generous. .
There are many TV screens for sports viewing indoor, and even a few outdoor.
An overall good atmosphere..They have a buffet and alacarte kind of system here ..upon ourvisit here we tried their buffet and ordered few delicacies from their Alacarte menu as well ..the food the drinks everything was on point .one can surely enjoy this place at any time of the day .as this place is a sports bar as such the reservation is recommended during any sport featurings .do head to this place if you are a sports buff and if yournt one as you will have a great time at this place

But after taking money they didn't provide a table. My team stood there for almost 50mins. Later we were forced to walk out.

Arena Eleven,Yash Kumar Singh,"It's during this time of the year where the cricket fanactics are on a lookout for places offering sports screenings and feel almost heartbroken not to find any dedicated sports bar in town. But not to worry as Arena Eleven's here to woo the same crowd, with their delightful sports-themed decor offering big-screen match telecasts for sports and all that coming with a beautiful rooftop ambience. Located at Level 4 of SLN Terminus Mall in Gachibowli, the tagline for the place is ""Kebabs, Beers & Sports"" each of which is incorporated in the menu as well as the setting quite aptly.

The menu for the place is particularly compact, serving only a selective few Indian and Oriental preparations both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian diets. Sampling their vegetarian appetizer from the a'la carte section, we ended up calling for their Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries both of which turned out to be pretty good. The platter came with 3 different tikkas of our choice, namely Veg Shami, Peri Peri and Lemon Pepper Paneer Tikka on a sizzling hot plate with onions on the base. Veg Shami was something that was absolutely mindblowing with a hint of heat both from chili and pepper with the perfectly soft texture. Masala Fries was just a Indianized version of loaded fries with the crisp potatoes sauted in with onions, ginger and garlic which worked as a good accompaniment for the drinks.

Non vegetarian section had some really nice dishes including the Tangri Kebab, Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka and Honey Chili Chicken Wings which were just perfect for a setting of this kind. My personal favourite was their Lemon Pepper Fish however, for the juicy and succulent fish chunks giving that lipsmacking balance of citrus and heat from the lemon juice and black pepper marination. Honey Chili Wings too were pretty good as a finger food having crispy fried wings tossed in a sticky sweet honey chili sauce, probably the best candidate to be had along with a couple of chilled beers. Disappointing was their Chili Fish however which had no flavour whatsoever - bland pieces of fish with the coating sauce containing just chili without any seasoning. The kitchen should probably revisit the recipe and take care in seasoning the fried fish with some salt and pepper.

Running a buffet on weekends, the place offers a beautiful selection of mains to the diners having a variety of Indian options to choose from. Each of the diets had two curries on offer with a choice of breads and rice, where the non vegetarian sect had Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani along with some delectable Chicken Tikka Biryani. After the disappointment in the starters, it almost came as a surprise how good both the mains were. Chicken Curry had the home style onion base with juicy boneless chicken bites added, going absolutely well with some hot Tandoori Rotis. Same was the case with Murg Makhani as well however it had a bit too much of sweetness for my taste. Trying out their Chicken Tikka Pizza from the a'la carte section turned out to be a disaster as the puffy base seemed to be store bought and stale, which definitely didn't justify the price tag for the same. The dessert options too gave little to choose from where we went for the Gajar ka Halwa and Rice Kheer both of which were plain simple average.

The service too wasn't any exemplary as the staff almost at all times paid no heed to the diners calling them out for help. Getting even a glass of water turned out to be a huge task, however on multiple complaints the restaurant manager did mend things well. The kitchen deserves appreciation for sending out dishes fast into the dining room however in the pace, they almost always lacked consistency. The dishes we ordered at the start of the meal when again called, brought something entirely different and dreadful on a plate. All in all, if the place provides a run-of-the-mill menu with a some good dishes but lacking the consistency to deliver entirely.

Arena Eleven,Vasanthi Singampalli,"Arena Eleven, nestled in SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, is a sports-themed bar and restaurant with live screenings all around. With two large screens and three televisions, no matter where your table is, you will be able to catch all the sporting action. During the day, the clarity of the large screens is lower, because of the bright light from the glass panes. The best part of the outdoor seating section is that it is located just beside the botanical garden with a sumptuous view of the green cover. Perfect to enjoy the cool breeze, watch a match and hang out with friends. 
 The bar menu offers an extensive range of classic cocktails with a good variety of imported spirits and liqueur. They serve a widespread buffet with an array of mains. The starters will be served to the table.
In the starters, we tried the Sizzling tikka platter which consists of Chicken Tandoori, lemon pepper Chicken, Tangdi Chicken, Paneer Tikka, Veg Seekh Kabab and Fish tikka. Tangdi Chicken made a perfect starter, soft and succulent chicken legs coated with a host of spices and grilled to perfection. Fish Tikka was melting in the mouth with good flavors. In veg, don't miss out in Paneer Tikka. It was so soft and properly cooked with the right amount of spices infused. Veg Seekh Kebab was good when we had it for the first time. But when ordered for the next time, it was very dry.
Apart from the Tikka platter, we tried Chicken 65, Honey chili wings, salt and pepper prawns, chili fish and Masala Fries. I loved all of them.

In the main course, from the buffet, they have two non-veg curries and two veg curries and assorted bread. Curries tasted delightful with rich gravy and spices on point. Ordered and tried their Thai Veg curry, which disappointed me, as it was too sweet. Chicken Tikka Biryani is a hit, It was as tasty as it looks. It was very different from the regular Hyderabadi Biryani yet very delicious. 
Tried the Butter Chicken Masala Pizza. Though the toppings were great, the pre-baked base which they used dropped the taste.

From desserts, they have Gajar Halwa and Rice Kheer. Tasted Ok-ish , not so great.

Drinks need some improvements, as some are very sweet.

If improved on the glitches in the food and drinks, its a great place to Eat, drink, socialize and watch your favourite sports live.",4,"78 Reviews , 181 Followers",4/24/2019 13:15,27,,"{'food': ['Chicken Tikka Biryani', 'Chicken 65', 'Honey chili wings', 'Salt and pepper prawns', 'Chili fish', 'Masala Fries', 'Chicken Tikka Biryani', 'Chicken 65', 'Honey chili wings', 'Salt and pepper prawns', 'Chili fish', 'Masala Fries'], 'drink': ['Thai Veg Curry', 'Chicken Tikka Biryani', 'Chicken 65', 'Honey chili wings', 'Salt and pepper prawns', 'Chili fish', 'Masala Fries', 'Chicken Tikka Biryani', 'Chicken 65', 'Honey chili wings', 'Salt and pepper prawns', 'Chili fish', 'Masala Fries']}"
Arena Eleven,Anvith Devulapally,"Rating: 3.5

Replacing Serafina, Arena Eleven is a new addition to the SLN Terminus mall. With TV screens playing different kinds of sports and walls adorned with sports memorabilia, the place is a crowd-puller during this IPL season. The place is well lit and has a long deck that gives you a beautiful view of the botanical garden.

Our Sunday lunch started with a few drinks. Mint Julep, Virgin Mojito, Virgin Sangria, Virgin Pina Colada, Zen Zero - a mojito like drink with cola, Calvados - their version of a hot toddy, Old fashioned and Kentucky Apple Cinnamon. Though the cocktails were potent, they lacked finesse. Mocktails in most cases were either too sweet or watered down. The better ones of the lot were Calvados, Apple Cinnamon and Mint Julep.

In the starters, we tried their sizzling tikka platter that had an assortment of regular chicken, lemon pepper, malai, nasheman, paneer and fish tikkas. The stand out ones here were the fish and lemon pepper tikkas. We also tried their Tangdi kebab, salt and pepper prawns, chili fish, salt and pepper wings, chicken 65, honey chili wings, chicken lollipop in hot garlic sauce, masala fries, chicken and veg sheek kebabs. One thing we noticed in these starters was the lack of consistency. Our first round of the veg sheek kebab was amazing which led us to order more. The second round was super disappointing as the kebab was dry and tasteless. The tangdi kebab was well made. Soft and juicy chicken marinated well and cooked to perfection in a tandoor. The chili fish and fish tikka too were super delicious!

I visited this place twice. During the first visit, I tried the Chicken peri peri tikka roll, Chicken Rajiala, Onion Kulcha and Thai Green Chicken curry for mains. The roll was passable. We were told that the chicken rajiala was a star on their menu but it didn't really prove to be. It tasted like a regular buffet green chicken curry. Nothing special. The thai green chicken curry blew us off with it's flavors. Each of the flavors in the dish could be tasted individually but when they came together, it was magic! Pairing it with some hot steamed rice elevated it further and left of licking our spoons! During the second visit, we chose to eat the mains from their Sunday buffet and it was not a great decision. Except a few dishes like the chicken curry and chicken tikka biryani, the rest were tasteless. We also ordered a chicken butter masala pizza that had a pre-made base and tasted substandard. We ordered a portion of the green curry again which utterly disappointed us by being too sweet.

They only had a couple of desserts in both instances - Gajar Halwa and Rice Kheer. They were just run-of-the-mill kind and didn't have any oomph factor.

Overall, one thing that the place needs is consistency. Their tag reads Kebabs. Beer. Sports but the kebabs part isn't really justified. Service is decent. They need quite a few improvements to keep up with the pace. They have some really pocket friendly happy hours and the place is awesome during sunset!

Arena Eleven,Shreshth Malhotra,"Arena Eleven is a relatively new addition to the concept of sports bar in the city. Located inside the SLN terminus, it attracts a relatively young crowd living in the nearby IT hubs.

I went over there to try out their Weekend Buffet. First things first, their Buffet layout was well spread. The starters were served on the table accompanied by an array of curries and rice dishes to choose from. The drinks offered by them included Mojito, Zen Zero and Mint Julep. The drinks were average and needs quite improvement.

Speaking about their starters, I had their Chicken Tangdi, Malai Paneer tikka, Salt and Pepper prawns, Lemon pepper Chicken tikka, Mutton Seekh kebab and Veg Seekh kebab.

Amongst all the starters, I loved their Chicken tangdi kebab. The chicken was super juicy and was cooked to perfection. The use of proper marination was quite evident in the taste of the meat. Next up, I also liked their Lemon pepper Chicken tikka. It had a subtle flavor of lemon all thanks to the dominating flavor of the pepper.

For mains, the spread comprised of two chicken main course dishes, two veg main course dishes accompanied by Dal, Assorted breads, Biryani and Salads. The chicken dishes were Chicken curry and Chicken tikka masala. I found both the curries simply wonderful just because of the fact that they were tasting much like home cooked chicken. For veg, their was Mutter Paneer and Paneer butter masala. I liked their Mutter Paneer as it was really balanced in terms of flavor.

Their Biryani was a slight disappointment for me. It could have been much more flavorful and the use of boneless chicken didn't really serve justice to the dish. Apart from this, I also had my hands on their Veg thai curry. It was served with steamed rice. To be honest, the preparation of Thai Green Curry was too good but the only thing which upset me was that it was sweeter than the normal version. Maybe, they can work upon the use of Cocunut cream in the curry.

For desserts, I had their Gajar ka Halwa, Kheer and Ice cream. The desserts were pretty much ordinary and needs ample improvement all together.

All in all, the place has got a huge potential. All they need to do is to work upon slight glitches in their drinks and few main course items. Happy eating. :)",4,"275 Reviews , 1989 Followers",4/22/2019 12:21,8,,
Arena Eleven,Suptikanta Mohapatra,"It looks like a sports bar with proper setup. But the people around did not seem to be sportive, especially on a Friday night :P. Service was a bit on the slower side. Ambiance was good. Now coming to the main part, the food.

Sizzling non-veg Tikka Platter with 3 tikkas of your choice.
Jamaica Chicken Tikka - the best of the lot and a must try.
Nasheman Chicken Tikka - not so appealing but ok ok types taste.
Malai fish tikka - soft and tasty
Bhuna Chicken - one of the best I have ever had especially the fried onions on the top makes it so delicious, so this is a must try
Chicken Rajiala - A green gravy with boneless chicken, not so tasty
Chicken Hakka Noodles - It was too good especially for Chinese lovers
Sizzling Chicken Tikka Biryani - look wise it was actually sizzling, but not so much taste wise. Chicken pieces were a bit hard and rice undercooked.
Ginger Coke - Please do not try this one, as it was too costly and not at all a worthy drink

They‚Äôve got quite a nice ambience for a sports bar.
Food was delicious.
I‚Äôve tried their sizzling non veg tikka platter where you get to choose 3 varieties from their whole kebabs menu!
As per the guy who served us, Jamaican and Nasheman was their speciality.
So we ordered that platter with Jamaican, Nasheman and Malai fish tikka.
Jamaican: 4/5 (more of a spicy tandoor)
Nasheman:3/5 (lame and tasteless)
Malai Fish:4/5 (loves the soft malai fish)

The only problem I faced was table management.

Arena Eleven,Arpa Ghosh,"I visited this place with my wife on 16 March,2019.  Its located in SLN terminus. We were looking for a place to dine after our movie at Platinum, and we decided to give this place a try. Was it worth it, lets find out.

Ambiance
============
We entered this place around 10 pm on a Saturday night and this place was  literally bustling with crowd. They have several television screens set up at various nook and corners of the lounge, and all of them played sports channel, ranging from Cricket to Premier League Football. We were promptly seated at the Verandah. The view from there is quite something. We got seated in a semi lit corner. The place has a cozy feeling and good vibes. Liked it. Ratings - 4/5.

Service
============
Pathetic. Needs a lot of improvement. They took some time to produce the Menu, and then the waiter just didn't show up for the order, for next 15 minutes at-least. We ordered food and drinks. The food was delayed and drinks just did't come. We had to repeatedly ask the waiter to serve the drinks at-least, so that we can end our boredom. Luckily the food came soon after the drinks were served. When asked for the bill, they showed a mobile shot of the bill amount taken by the cashier, saying printer was faulty. Phew! Ratings - 1/5.

Food
============
Did food proved to be the Savior for the night? Read on.  We ordered a cranberry breezer, virgin mojito and couple of Pinacoladas(Yes, we took advantage of Gold membership). The virgin mojito was pathetic. Period.  The Pinacoladas were really good. We ordered for Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter, which was strictly okay.  Well the service and food really disappointed. Ratings - 3/5.

Value for Money
=============
We shelled out 1200 bucks for food and drinks, that too have taken the gold membership advantage. High pricing along with lousy service and strictly average food never go hand in hand. So no way its VFM. Ratings - 1.5/5.

Let's calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 2.375

Arena Eleven,George B.,"Experience at Arena Eleven... Since it‚Äôs in SLN Terminus mall it‚Äôs not very difficult to find. It was a Friday when we had dinner here and the experience it wasn‚Äôt the best, although it could be! Place was packed by 9-9:30 pm. Definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better. One big minus point is that on a Friday evening the washroom was out of order and I had to cross all SLN third floor to get to the toilet. Ups, that‚Äôs really bad!

Ambiance is vibrant, atmosphere is good but the music is too loud! Usually I don‚Äôt mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation. They have screens and it‚Äôs a good place to watch some sports. There is some kind of terrace too and that‚Äôs good till the hot summer.

Service was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen. They also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order weren‚Äôt available (like burgers, pizza, etc). On a Friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered!

When it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average. We had sizzling kebab platter. Chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose. Awesome kebabs!! Really juicy and tasty every each one of them. We had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious. They didn‚Äôt give any mirch ka salaan, raitha or onion with the biryani, just plain but I asked for some raitha and they brought. Rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just 4 small pieces. The let down were the rolls. We had 4 different types of rolls with fries and wedges. Maximum average on quality and taste.
The price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try, at least for the kebabs!

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Prerna,"So, it's our first time in Hyderabad and we thought of having a great meal at Radisson! We visited Cascade and much to our disappointment we found the food not even close to being great! The vegetarian spread was very less with just 4 starters and that too of similar type! Non vegetarian variety was better than vegetarian but was also not up to the mark. Thought of making peace with the situation by hoping that the desserts would at least be nice, but they too weren't nice.
One of the worst experiences of all times!

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,George B.,"Sunday brunch experience at Cascade-Radisson. It was a mixed experience because they had things we loved but also things we hated, I‚Äôll describe in the review.

Service was really good, one of the best. Mr. Salim and staff really did a great job to host us. Plus point for them!

Ambiance instead was a total let down, at least for us. Floor was dirty (as you can see in some pics), chairs were dirty, even the water bottle was dirty. The restaurant itself has nothing special, no atmosphere... just bland. If you want to go and have a good time and to enjoy the atmosphere this is a NO NO!

Food was on the good side. It had good spread and some really good items as fish in butter sauce or polenta with mushroom ragou. Starters were average as desserts. The best part on desserts was the fresh made waffles. All other items are usually like everywhere, salad counter, pizza and pasta counter etc. With some small exceptions has nothing special on menu but not bad on taste.

When it comes to the price for the buffet I think is too expensive. Most of the times we go out with some kind of discounts or coupons but at full price definitely not worth it!

I went for buffet here having lots and lots of expectations, but all waste. I didnot understand still what cuisines or what food they are trying to serve ! First of all , all the menu in the buffet were cold, i felt like i am eating a day before's food. Not at all fresh. You will find lots and lots of varities in buffet, but when it comes to taste, disappointed. It was completely waste of money. Services and hospitality was somewhat good. But i am not at all happy with this place. To the Management ,here is request Please Change your menu and the way you cook. There are many other places which serves far better food. I cannt even think to visit this place again.

Mr Suresh Reddy who is the F&B manager ensured that we had a very good time during our special get together. By the time we decide we needed something, it was served to us without prompting. That was Fantastic!! Thank you so much to the manager and his whole team for making our meet special. üôÇ",5,"14 Reviews , 7 Followers",11/27/2018 19:31,0,,"{'food': ['dishes', 'spicy', 'creamy', 'unique', 'simple'], 'drink': []}"

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Rahul Agarwal,"We went for the buffet lunch at Radisson after a few years. The overall experience was very average. There were events going on and the place was overcrowded. Very few staff to help/assist.
Coming to food, some items on the buffet were decent. The basics liike Paneer curry, lacha paratha etc were good.
Salads and chaats were OK.
Desserts were below average.
The one thing that is usually safe is a pizza. They had pasta and pizzas as part of the buffet. Unfortunately they couldn't get the pizza to taste decent. I had to leave pizza and eat something else, which I never do.

First impressions about the Buffet was that the spread was huge and also contained many live counters. It had a nice mix of South Indian, North Indian and Continental dishes.

I tried many of their dishes but the items I liked the most here are Palak Idly, Cheese Omelette, Chicken Sausages, fresh Grape juice, White Chocolate Berliner and Black currant Yogurt.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Right Fooodies,"Cascade is a luxury dining restaurant that falls under the notorious Carlson Group of Hotels and offers multi-cuisine dishes.

The tremendous ambiance fully complements the canons of the place and instantly lightens up your mood into musical. An addition to the offering is an elaborate buffet for foodies. Cascade is in Gachibowli main road.

It‚Äôs located on the second floor of the property. While the lobby is inviting, it only dispels all the doubts about the food being as inviting as the lobby. As you enter Cascade, you are greeted by a Buddha Statue.

As soon as you enter their food counter spread all over at the corner side. we had a few veg and non -veg salad, sausage with spinach. Started picking one of one and observed fish was stale and seems It was reused. The chicken was hard and sausage was almost beginning to wring itself.

Actually, none of the salads were any good, partly because they weren‚Äôt fresh - something that is supposed to be figurative of a salad ‚Äì ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù.

Starters : We had veg and non-veg soups, lots of breads - naan, roti, kulchas. Veg starters included paneer tikka, potatoes, veg mix fried. Non-veg included couple of chicken items and fish. They had little variety of but not so tasty starters.

Anyway, rushed towards main course ‚ÄòDal makhani‚Äù which was waste. Or in another word, I was searching for Dal Makhani flavor. And I feel, in this level of restaurant at least Dal Makhani should be right!

Moved ahead and tried vegetable dum biryani with Mutton curry. I must appreciate, mutton curry was yummy and cooked properly but in the same dum biryani could be better.

For desserts, it's a good mix of Indian (including Hyderabadi bestseller Double Ka Meetha) and European delicacies.

I am not much of a dessert being, but was glad to see a large number of desserts in the buffet.

Overall, I will not call it astonishing stuff, but it has wonderful musical spacious place with decent ambiance but they need to improve food side a lot.",3,"72 Reviews , 2078 Followers",5/15/2018 10:42,0,,"{'food': ['veg and non-veg soups', 'paneer tikka', 'potatoes', 'veg mix fried', 'chicken items', 'fish'], 'drink': []}"

Ambiance: Well it's Radisson, so the place looks amazing and one side has huge windows that overlook the gachibowli road. On the opposite is a nice glass wall with water running over it. The spread is at the end with the soups on one side veg and non-veg starters on one side and main course on the other side. Live chat, breads and ice-cream counters on the side. There are beautiful chandeliers and the lighting. The place looks really good.

Food: First of all the spread was amazing. We had veg and non-veg soups, lots of breads - naan, roti, kulchas. Veg starters included paneer tikka, potatoes, veg mix fried. Non-veg included couple of chicken items and fish. The fish was really good and I enjoyed the chicken starters especially the peri peri chicken. 

In main course we had lamb stew, jamaican jerk chicken, kung pao fish and another fish item with coconut rice, steamed rice, noodles with veg and non-veg biryani. For vegetarians we had paneer tikka masala, dal, baked veggies and few other options. The best item was the jerk chicken followed by the kung pao. I also tried the samosa chat which was quite good.

Finally came the desserts. There were cakes, halwa, macaroons and various other items. The macaroons were the best followed by the cheese cake.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Aarti Kamath,"During our stay at Radisson, we had our breakfast here and it was very good experience compared to its peers in the area.

Breakfast review -

A typical buffet everyday seems very wide spread with options for everyone. There are about 10 Indian options like Idlis, wada, dosas to order, pav bhaji, puris, parathas to order, upma, poha etc. I couldn‚Äôt try everything, but the paneer paratha was very good and I totally recommend. The bakery counter has multiple selections too that comprises of different bread rolls, basic breads, butter/filled croissants, choices of donuts (excellent), cupcakes etc.! They also have several selections of beverages (hot and cold and soy drinks too), vegan options on request, variants of muesli and cereals, choice of cheese, salads, fruits, etc. They have western (cold cuts etc.) and Asian (noodles and rice) alternatives too!

Pros: Widespread buffet, most of the spread is very good in taste, helpful staff, comfortable seating.

Suggestion - Would be nice if the staff smiles and makes it more welcoming.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Manikanda Pai,"We went to Cascade for Birthday dinner and opted for buffet.

Ambiance: very beautiful. Not clustered and has a relaxed atmosphere to it. 
Service: the moment you go in they had all the details as I had booked through a app and we were escorted to our table the service has been prompt and excellent with polite staff and courteous behavior. 
Food: Very good spread. lot of options for salad. I went for the egg salad and the chicken salad. Very tasty.
Starters: good spread of veg and non veg. Very happy with the Hong Kong fish and zaffrani chicken. both were very tasty and must have. In veg crispy veg was a must have. Most of the starters were cold. Considering we went almost at the beginning not sure how it can be cold so fast. Moving on to the main course. another great spread and good options for veg and non veg. Fish was very salty so i had to pass that. other dishes were very good and mashed potato is a must try. Chettinad chicken was another must have. They had rotis and nans to order (live). I tried the Mongolian rice from the live counter. did not excite my taste buds much. Another problem with the main course some items were cold or lukewarm. 
Some more options in main course was one veg biryani, Mutton biryani, chicken curry, Chicken curry was something I would go for again but not so much happy with the biryani but again being a hyderbadi the taste buds for biryani is absolutely different. 
Desserts: another vast variety and i will give it 10/10. 

Overall: if not for the food being cold and fish item being salty the rating would have been better. Overall I would recommend this place for a casual dining. if you are looking for a place to have a relaxed atmosphere and have food at leisure away from the hustle and bustle this is a good place to be. 
Suggestion: I some how feel the placing of the spread was not apt. I mean it was very confusing at time and we had to take help again and again. for example. Soups is placed after the biryani. A little more organized would be good...",3.5,"24 Reviews , 22 Followers",10/23/2017 6:06,0,,
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Sabyasachi Raychaudhuri,"A buffet with a nice spread and value for money pricing is always in demand. The ‚ÄúSpices Unlimited‚Äù buffet at Cascade, the all-day dining restaurant at Radisson Hitech City is an example of this. The newly revamped menu of this buffet, on for both lunch and dinner, ensures that everyone has something suiting his palate. Quite a number of live counters make this even more interesting.

The buffet is priced at an attractive Rs 1255 (all taxes included). Invited for a review of the buffet, I first did a recce of the items served. I was happy to note that huge spread had something for everybody. There were dishes from different cuisines, ranging from North Indian, South Indian, local Hyderabadi, Pan-Asian to continental. Live counters included those for dosa, ice creams as well as pasta and pizza. The dessert counter looked pretty extensive too.

Among the starters was Paniyaram, the round batter balls popular as a breakfast or snacks. This was served with three types of chutneys ‚Äì coconut, mint and tomato. I usually do not try veg starters but this was soft and good and the chutneys were delicious.
 

Other vegetarian starters included Potli Samosa, Kothmir Vada, and assorted vegetables in Chilli Sauce. Veg Sushis were also on display, but I did not try it.

Chicken Quesadilas filled with a nice stuffing and grilled was one attractive dish in the non-veg section. Fish Tikka was a little bit too spicy for me. Chicken Nuggets, Pepper Fish and Shanghai Chicken Dry were the other non-vegetarian appetizers.

The pizzas for the day included a simple Margarita as well as Chicken Pizza.I tried a couple of dosas from the live counter ‚Äì my choice was the Kheema Dosa though the Beetroot Dosa was a novelty too for its looks, like the coloured burgers which are in vogue these days.

The buffet also had an extensive salad bar with highlights such as Braised Chicken & Mushroom Salad and Roasted Lamb with Onion & Cabbage.

Over to the main courses. Continental cuisine seems to be a strong point of the chef team. The vegetarian main courses included Balsamic Grilled Vegetables, a dish which had babycorn, carrots and beans in a balsamic vinegar based sauce. The sweet and sour Vegetable Caponata was another dish of note. Lamb Ossobuco, an Italian main course of lamb shanks with a dark gravy was one dish that was really good. Poached Fish in a watery gravy did not have much of taste, the same applies for the Roasted Potatoes.

The Chinese part of the buffet had quite a good collection too. Fish Thai Red Curry went well with Szechuan Noodles. There was a vegetarian dish Mushroom & Bamboo Shoot in Scallion Sauce which also attracted my attention.

The Indian section had biryanis, both veg and non-veg which are must for any Hyderabadi buffet. The other local dish was Hyderabadi Fish Curry. From the Andhra kitchen, Kodi Koora and Ulavacharu made their mark. Maa ki Dal and Matar Paneer were the Punjabi dishes served.

I am not much of a dessert person, but was happy to see a large number of desserts in the buffet. Sweets included Shrikhand, Rasmadhuri and Hot Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. 
 

Overall, I will not call it extraordinary stuff, but it was a nice spread and a value-for-money buffet. The lunch buffet which I attended on a weekday had a huge rush, pointing to the popularity of the restaurant. The menu changes every day so that the regular clientele is provided with a change of taste.

We had booked a table via Nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality, variety of dishes and a great ambience. But somehow, we don't know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it. It is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that, we don't know.

When I retrospect back home, I thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there. Not that they were rude but they didn't care much. The manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us.

Well, coming to the dishes, we had a nice sumptuous dinner. The best part was the dessert section. If had a variety of spreads. It was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes.
Oh, boy! I had a ball.

Had the staff had been a little attentive, I'd have rated an easy 4.0! I guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the Nearbuy. But we've been too many 5-star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently.

Being housed in a star property, the place has subtle interior designing, a great buffet area and a sprawling dessert counter with a mind blowing array of desserts.

While I loved the samosas, cheese calzones, a couple of Indian dishes from the buffet like the butter garlic naan and the curries, overall their food does leave a lot to be desired. Desserts such as black current ice cream and brownies were good.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Anupama Majety,"I had been here twice in the last 2 weeks with my teams. The food served was good.
Things which I liked: 
- Number of starters and deserts are good
- Food taste is good and medium spicy.
- Offers different varieties of parathas
- Pizzas were served hot on table on request
- Pastas and fresh fries tasted good

Things which I did not like:
- Veg and non-veg items are clubbed every where and there is no demarcation. So need to be very careful.
- Buttermilk served was very bland and can be improved
- Items were not hot most of the time.
- Service was bad. They missed the pizzas ordered and had to be reminded again.
- Mint chutney tasted bad",4,"11 Reviews , 9 Followers",5/24/2017 13:41,0,,"{'food': ['starters', 'deserts', 'parathas', 'pizzas', 'pastas', 'fresh fries'], 'drink': []}"
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Anand Radhakrishnan,"Came here for some late night dinner and my experience can be termed ""Pathetic"" to say the least. They do not believe in serving a glass of water unless specifically asked for after 20 minutes of being there. The smell of the cleaning liquid was so strong that i lost my appetite and to top it gave me a splitting headache. Although they claim it to be open 24 hours, they apparently start cleaning up the place around midnight. Customers be damned! I asked them to pack up the food because there was no way i was going to eat from there bearing the mind numbing smell. After the food parcel was given, they wouldn't give me the cheque unless of course, again specifically asked for. The kind of experience you would expect from a place that serves biryani for Rs 50 and not Rs 800!!

1. Food variety: Very less compared to any star rated hotels in similar bracket. We were offered only 2 types of Veg and Non veg starters and without even mentioning the dish name. No mutton items what so ever, neither in starters, nor in main course.

2.  The service was poor and slow. I am not sure whether that is for quantity of staff or the quality of staff.
None of the staff was nice or responsive in a way that makes you feel good.
3. The quality of food changed with subsequent refill.  Even the ice creams were too sweet.",1,"2 Reviews , 25 Followers",4/22/2019 10:59,0,,"{'food': ['starters', 'main course'], 'drink': []}"

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Shreyansh Agarwal,"I have been here for breakfast. Its a huge spread as other 5 star properties usually have, but I saw a great variety and different kind of a menu here. For me, a waffle cart was the best part. I just loved the hot and crispy waffles with maple syrup, nutella and berries compost. Do ask for a chef's special. The breakfast option with the stay is a must pick and do try as much as possible from the spread.
A few other things which I liked were the baked potatoes. Just loved them.
Another good thing about them was that they did not cut the fruits beforehand. You had to select your choice and they were cut right in front of you. In the juices section, I could remember a carrot ü•ï ginger, tulsi, aloevera and many such. Detox water was another addition. Apart from these, you could chose the fruits and veggies you wanted and they would make a fresh juice right in front of you.

After starters when we asked for main course, the staff told that on Friday they have only street food and no main course is available. Felt like we wasted our money.

Though the starters were good, but main course should also be there. Street food should be the add on and not the only food.

Two stars only for the ambience.

They have 3 main live counters - one which makes fresh Dosas and Parathas, second makes the waffles and pancakes and the third makes all the egg varieties.
They also have a huge counter for fruits, juices and herbal shots.
Then there is the Indian food counter which has multiple varieties like - chicken curry or Keema curry with Pav, Idli and Wada with Sambhar and 3 types of chutney, Poha or something similar, and few more items.
There is also a counter which serves noodles, sauteed veggies, steamed fish or chicken and Chicken sausages, congee and Miso soup.
Then there is counter with cheeses, cold cuts, pre-made salad, some sweet jars, etc.
Then there's obviously the cereal counter and the breads counter which has amazing Danish bakery items, bread pudding and other baked breads.

there is no welcome drink. Even an ordinary restaurant offers at least a grape juice.

main course : only 2 biryanis (veg n chicken). and just a paneer curry and chicken curry with some fancy namedesserts :
ice creams only strawberry n chocolate flavors which are semi solid n turns to liquid by the team you eat it.
no fruits other than papaya n water melon is very disappointing from a 5 star hotel

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Vijaya,"Amid the busy lanes of financial district, lies this serene place with lots of greenery and makes one feel pleasant on the outset. A little ahead when you walk through the lobby, lies this very spacious restaurant. Very well managed place I must say. Spacious, well lit with the usage of a lot of natural lighting. The AC temperature was a tad bit on the higher side which was informed to one the the staff but didn't find much difference even after informing.

Service was slow and a little out of place. We asked if they could get milkshakes as we had kids with us. The lady who went to check this has never returned or answered the query. Next, we found the glasses a little smelly which we asked to be replaced. But was never done. The rotis took a lot of time to come. Clearing the used plates took way too long despite informing multiple times. Asked for shawarmas and some food from the live counters which never happened or only a part of it was served. Requested for the dessert section to be extended a little further but again, took away without informing.

Coming to the food, there's loads of choice. Except for a few items on the menu, nothing is worth a Hyatt standard. Loved the ariselu live counter. Shawarmas tasted bland and could not take more than one bite. Mutton curry was too oily and no meat in it. It was filled with bones. Also liked the varieties of rice available.

Overall, a place that could be so much more than what it currently is. If only this was better managed, it has the potential to be the best.",2,"207 Reviews , 927 Followers",2/5/2019 14:42,34,,"{'food': ['ariselu live counter', 'varieties of rice'], 'drink': []}"

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Rajani P,"Had an amazing brunch at Collage, Hyatt Hyderabad.

I generally stay away from clicking pics at a buffet unless it‚Äôs something on our table but we were smitten by the desserts so much that I couldn‚Äôt resist clicking them. Each dessert was an amazing piece of craftsmanship, delicately plated and arranged (esp for something at a buffet).

The food and spread were equally awesome. There was Sushi üòç, Mexican üòç, Indian, Asian and Pizza.

The Mexican spread was plenty with nachos being my favorite as they came with lot of sides like guacamole, salsa, mango salsa and Parmesan. Didn‚Äôt explore the Asian side much but they had steamed veg and chicken momos. The live counters consisted of pindi chole, several types of paranthas, appam & stew.

The sushi was good but not great, especially the wasabi didn‚Äôt have a strong flavor. But being a buffet we were still satisfied with what they had.

We ended up here as someone dear gifted us a couple dinner voucher and with just few weeks left for its validity we decide to give the place a visit on Thursday evening.
Closeby to our office we reached the place located in Nanakramguda just near the Amazon office and opposite Waverock.
We presented the voucher and they guided us inside with a preference of outdoor or indoor seating. We choose the former.
The ambience us very nice dimly lit with slow breeze.. would be even better during winter months.
We ordered for some cold drinks and went onto explore the buffet. A fine spread with a good assortment of Indian and continental dishes. One could take noodles and pasta from live counters.
Starters
Soups , salads , dimsum, fried chicken- the options for typical Indian starters are less- when enquired by the staff attending us about the quality we told them about the having less of Indian starters - they promptly arranged for some fried fish and chicken

Main course
Biryani rice, wet varieties of chicken, mutton and fish, one could lean into the continental side too with fried rice and noodles

Desserts
The best spread in Hyd from my experience. It ranged from variety of sweet bakery products to the Indians traditional sweets. None of them will disappoint you. People who have a habit of starting the buffet backwards are in for a treat

Overall we spent about 3 hours chit chatting enjoying the food and experience amazing service. Must recommended for people who want to just unwind after a hectic work day

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Andrew J. Kim,"There are two restaurants, and they are Collage, a multi cuisine restaurant and Deori, authentic India cuisine restaurant. I always have my breakfast and dinner at Collage except the first day at this hotel.
Many service staffs take order and serve foods. All of them are thorough in the mindset of serving customers. Especially, among these staffs, [Parmeshwar] and [Lalmalsawmi] have very good sense of service, and are outstanding to understand what customers really want.
From the moment of entry to the Collage to the exit, they really care about my moving path within the restaurant. In case of Parmeshwar, he always greets me with smiley face and guides me to my table. He always asks my feeling of the day and recommends the food as per my mood. He is always getting me things I ask for and never forgets brings me things whereas others sometimes forgets as they are always busy and be asked by other customers for things on their way to get something I ask for. He has very good knowledge and insights of the industry and field in which he work and talk with me the way it needs to be improved for better service. As for Lalmalsawmi, she always keeps an eye on me. She brings me chopsticks or Kimchi, depending on the food I order even though I do not ask. She knows how many ice cubes I like in a glass depending on the types of beverages I drink. She never forgets to have water bottles frozen in a freezer a day before I play golf because I drink a lot of water while I play golf under the smoking hot weather. This is something I even forget myself and that is why I really want to thank her.

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Foodi Foodi,"I have been staying at Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli for seven (7) weeks as of today.
First, my stay at this hotel could not be any better because of the services and hospitality that this hotel is providing to me especially in terms of food.

My first concern in terms of going abroad is about food. I usually go on business trips for more than three months staying at one country. Regardless of your nationality, just imagine how hard it would be to have food, which you have never had in your life, and you have to deal with the food more than one month. When you stay at a hotel and the hotel prepares same of similar dishes almost every day, you will be easily sick and tired of having the food all the time. Besides, India is a country where it is hard to find restaurants that serve pork or beef dishes. Furthermore, as being a Korean, cilantro or coriander are something that we are not used to and do not use in the food cooking, but most dishes in India are with this herb regardless of the type of food; Italian, Japanese Thai or Chinese. However, I find foods at this Collage restaurant at Hyatt Hyderabad is not using those herbs for Western or Asian food, and this is what I like this restaurant the best. Besides, for buffet dinner, majority of the food are daily changed. I personally consider this the most important factor for long-term stay guest just like me.

Therefore, my food life at Collage @Hyatt Hyderabad is always happy because of so much efforts the <<chef Prashant>>, <<chef Pushkar>>, <<chef Sankhar>> and <<chef Santosh>>, are putting into to cater my taste. In addition, they study Korean food or other Asian food and cook for me as special treatment to please me. Sometimes, we even talk about food making and recipes, and they cook some special food as per my special request.

During breakfast and dinnertime, these chefs always come to my table and ask if the buffet foods at the Collage restaurant fit my taste.

I strongly recommend everyone that Collage is a place you must have meals during your stay at Hyderabad. Lastly, through this review, I sincerely express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart.",5,"1 Review , 44 Followers",11/16/2017 22:52,23,,

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Saad Khan,We had dinner at this place last night. The spread was quite lavish but we personally felt that non-vegetarian dishes were less when compared to the pricing of the buffet. The food was average as compared to the other Hyatt at Banjara Hills. The only thing I enjoyed was the fresh ravioli pasta they were serving. And also they had no soft drinks included in the buffet which is quite stingy.

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Suyash Dhandhania,"Was visiting my in laws for the first time. To celebrate the occasion we came here after more than hour long drive. And oh boy, did this place disappoint!? Not only did they lack the basic services like serving Papad and water in the beginning, they made blunders like serving Long Island Ice tea to a pregnant woman instead of the lemon ice tea that she ordered. We were a group of 11 people and were seated in a private room. We had to keep going out of the room to call the waiters only to be responded with an arrogant attitude, especially by the restaurant manager Parmeshwar from Lucknow. Each order took a long time to come and was served cold. And when I say served, I don't mean served by them. Oh no, the waiters simply kept all the dishes on one side of the table and left it to us to serve ourselves. Despite of this, on lack of better judgment, we made a horrible mistake of ordering the dessert which we just left after a bite because it was that bad. Needless to say, our night was ruined and to end it all, just when we thought it can't get any worse, they over billed us. We spent 20 mins to get it corrected. The icing on the cake was, the charged us for the Long Island Ice Tea as well üòÇüòÇ.
Please avoid this place at all costs. And you'll be saving a LOT! üòÖ You'll also save yourselves from mosquito bites because they'll refuse to provide you with a mosquito repellent when you ask for it.
P. S- If you're a cheese enthusiast, please don't make the same mistake of ordering the cheese platter as we did. For ‚Çπ600, they served us stale cheese with few almonds, crackers and 2 apricots.

Except the place, nothing was good. Specially the Menu and the food was not really good.

The items on the buffet were so limited that I hardly had anything to eat. Multi-Cuisines (On the website: Continental, Italian, North Indian, Chinese, Asian, Thai), but in reality only continental and Asian.

That too without a chicken starter in the continental department and the Fish served was so salty that it was not at all eatable. Not even a single Indian item was found in the entire menu.

Very less options of non-veg on the buffet both in Indian & western.
Only a chicken pie, & an oriental chicken dish inside. In the Indian had only Biryani & raara gosht.
The highlight was in place like Hyatt your serving Vada Pav as part of the sunday brunch, come on you must be really kidding me, I am sure you can do better than this. üòÄ
Lauki mussalam on the vegetarian spread just to name a few of the not so appetising options there. ‚òπÔ∏è
Pizza was just like an Indian papad with some dry chicken and cheese on top.

So, buffet breakfasts is something I particularly enjoy and the one I had at Collage, Hyatt Hyderabad was quite a decent one at that. 

Hyatt Gachibowli is a beautifully done property and Collage is one of its pretty restaurants. With a variety of options to choose from, the buffet breakfast a quite a steal.

From American favorites like muffins, donuts, waffles and croissants to Indian delicacies like Masala Dosa, Idli and Usal pav, most of the things were delectable. Fresh cut fruits, juices and salads, live omelet counter, tea, coffee, milk, different types of juices, a selection of breads, different types of jams and cheese, well, the list is endless.

Amazing taste & quality of meat, a paradise for north eastern cuisine lovers, Zing's serves large varieties of non-veg dishes in a pocket-friendly budget. Just a reminder, this is not a place to have vegeterian foods. I have read many reviews explaining how the vegetarian people were apalled by the smell of raw/ cooked meat while visiting this restaurant. They are very misleading and misinformative. First of all, you shouldn't be here if you are looking for veg momo or veg fried rice. Period.
I tried almost every pork starters and every mocktails available in their menu. Not once I have been disappointed. Every food items is tasty enough to deserve 5 rating.
The one little place for improvement could be to increase the number of staffs. Due to excessive demand, they find it difficult to cater to everyone at the same pace, hence you'd find many reviews telling how their service is slow, how people waited for 1 hour after ordering for food to show up.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Soumith,"This place has been a bookmark for me since very long as there are only few places which can serve pork. After seeing all those positive reviews in Zomato, I decided to give it a try.
I along with 3 of my friends went on a Friday Eve to this place.

Appetizers :

1. Deojikalbi : This is a pork appetizer, we loved it very much and repeated the order. For the second time, we asked the restaurant staff to increase spice levels in the dish which turned out to be really delicious.

2. Pork ribs : I did not enjoy this dish really much. Meat was tender but the sauces they used did not satisfy my taste buds. I dunno if north-east people love this type of food but it's ok, it was my first time.

3. Pepper chicken : Due to unavailability of lemon grass chicken, we had to order this appetizer. Taste was good , nothing fancy.

Main Course :

1. Ramyun with Pork : we ordered 2 rumyun with pork, taste was good but we liked the other dish which we ordered.

2. Soba noodles with pork and veggies : This dish tops the list. Luckily, I am the one who ordered this dish and my friends were having ramyun.
Soba noodles have a dark sauce and intense taste compared to ramyun. If tasted really delicious. I cannot say how perfect this dish is.

3. Naga-chicken rice : When restaurant staff placed this dish on our table, I saw chicken was undercooked. I asked the same to them, they said this is how north-east people like to eat, a bit chewy. I thought chalo let's try it, but chicken was so chewy that it's taking 5 minutes for me to complete a small piece of it.
I was disappointed with this dish.

Overall experience :

Food : 3.5 / 5
Service : 3/5 ( it was too slow)
Ambience : 3.5 / 5 (cute lil place but gets crowded on weekends)

But nothing changed over the time in terms of service, rather it's turned worse over time. There can't be an excuse of quality of food in exchange of service. If food is the only yardstick, they fail to beat that as well. Dishes are pretty authentic but equally monotonous in taste.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,"Ashisha, The 'Bon Viveur'","A fine and cute place like that of a cottage to have variety dishes!

Drinks:

1. Berry blast: Loved it, i would say it is my version of a drink. The right maroon version of the combination of the flavor of sweetness more than sour.

2. Green ice mountain mojito: You can find green apples in this drink. A little sour, although i liked it.

I would like to suggest to bring the drinks along with the main course rather than us having to wait and ask for it after the main course.

Teriyaki chicken: served with flavored rice. Nothing special about its taste. This is a thumbs down comparing to the other dishes i had.

Beef & Pork kimchi bokkum bap: I just liked the flavor of the rice. Both of it had a unique taste although both appeared the same. They were mixed with the right quantity of pork/beef. The piece were eatable, and not much chewy.

Pork & Beef Naga chilly curry: The flavor of these were almost the same although beef and pork has its own taste. The taste was fine with the right amount of chilly spiciness. The gravy is ravishing as well.

Service: Just fine. The waiter didn't have a pleasant look on taking our order/serving us.

They don't even bother to keep cutlery at the table, not even tissue papers. The AC does not work and on a summer afternoon the place is like an oven.

Coming to food. If you manage to get what you like on the menu, it is a miracle. They open at 11.30. We asked for their weekend only dishes on a weekend at 1.30 and were told very unapologetic, rather rudely that they don't have it. Finally after we managed to find something that we liked and they had, we were told it would take 35 mins because a party of six had placed a big order. Now the taste. The ingredients are very good and fresh. The quality of pork is great. The taste doesn't have much variation. Everything is super spicy with just the proportion of sauces being different. After a while the taste buds just go numb with the spice. If this is how the food of North eastern India is, well, I'll avoid that geography. And I'll surely avoid this eatery.

Drinks were as displayed, tofu was bit disappointing..it was literally fried tofu with sauce on it and sesame seeds..can miss this if you plan to go.

Do definitely try the bap! Tasty and filling, great portions of the veggies, rice, sauce...although rice wasnt sticky and i thought dolsot bap always came with hot claypot..nevertheless tasty!

In the middle of the meal we asked for hot sauce and there came the sauce very tiny quantity, we were like WTF..the sauce was HOT made from naga chillies yet sooo good..burned my tongue but loved every bit of it..so if you have rice remaining give this a try as well.

üç¥Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns (Prawns toasted in fresh herbs, lime, pepper and chilly flakes)

Main course:
üçΩÔ∏è Naga Steam Fish (made with Naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes)
üçΩÔ∏è Teriyaki Chicken (served with flavoured rice and green vegetables)

Drinks:
üçπSummer Time and Summer Lime (Orange juice served with fresh orange, mint and lime, commingled with masala)
üçπFresh Lime Soda (sweet)

Of the four dishes listed above, the first three were recommended by Madcapmanikin. And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. She hasn't been off with her recos even once. But Zing's came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.

In all honesty, when the starters arrived, I felt that the portions were quite small. I couldn't taste the prawns (because allergies), but the Enlightened One felt that they could've been a tad fresher. And even though the waiter told me that the #KalbiBokum wasn't too sweet, I could've lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy.

But believe you me when I say that the main courses changed the game completely. The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. The raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this Bangal!

It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Divya Iyer,"We wouldn't have found this gem of a place if we hadn't been at the mall opposite and looking for a place to have lunch. More than a month since we visited, but it was such a treat! The place is tiny, right on the road but still can be missed out if you are not looking for it.

The menu is pretty extensive, but going by our love for pork, we dove right into the traditional pork dishes on offer. We ordered Soba noodles with pork and veggies, Naga Pork curry (which came with rice) and then added some smoked fried pork with bamboo shoots.

The noodles were alright, but had sort of a maggi consistency - but there was enough pork to enhance the flavor. The naga pork curry was a revelation - spicy but so full of flavor, my daughter who is averse to spices ate a fair bit! The fried pork was delicious too, but an overkill, going by how we were already full with the first two dishes. 

We had ordered the flavored beer they have, which was refreshing but relatively overpriced. But just for the food, I think we need to visit again.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Tanmayi Mohan,"Having heard a lot about this place and my curiosity to try a new cuisine that's a part of India, but different from the other usual cuisines, led me and a bunch of my friends to Zing's for dinner.

First up, we were greeted with a distinct smell of raw pork which was mildly unpleasant. The starters were quite good- spicy chicken momos and the pork preparations (pork belly and some kind of chilly fried pork).
The main course, however, was disappointing, or perhaps we expected something else. The Ramyum noodles tasted like a bland version of Top Ramen and the noodles had a strange texture to them. There was not enough broth either (which you tend to expect from any kind of ramen noodles). The Teriyaki chicken rice was a tad too sweet for my palette personally.

The best thing would be the prices- everything is so resonably priced, it's not easy to find non-veg (especially pork, beef etc) at these prices!

One major area of feedback would be the service. They have an extremely laidback, dont-really-care attitude, and it took a bit of effort for us to get their attention and get them to the table each time.

A little more effort from the management and they could be do loads better than they are currently- maybe even start a franchise :)

Decent food. Average Service. Affordable pricing. Big on non vegetarian delicacies.

Small place with cute interiors serves up some mouth watering momos, bruschetta and Ramen.
Good things take time, especially if it‚Äôs a newbie kitchen trying to serve you food. Be patient. The service is slow but the food is good.

If you‚Äôre looking for a bowl of north Eastern style of Ramen, try their version of it. Simple, soupy and well spiced. It‚Äôs a bowl of comfort. Let‚Äôs not get your hopes high just yet. It‚Äôs their version of it and not an attempt to mimic the classic ramen that is usually popular otherwise.

The momos are good, soft and melt in the mouth- must try. They run out of the vegetarian ones rather soon.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Rajat Goel ‚ú≥Ô∏è,"Having heard a lot of hype surrounding this place, and the 4.5 rating on Zomato, it was on my wishlist for ages, but I was always skeptical of the taste, being too authentic and a totally new cuisine. The former proved to be true, and was the primary reason I didn't have a very pleasing dinner.

It's a small and cute little diner like Cafe, with minimalistic and soothing interiors. The sour smell of fermentation was nauseating initially, but I got used to it in just a few minutes. Some room freshener would do the trick.

The items are priced very cheap, I had high expectations, but only to learn later the portions are just too small. We had:

üçó SPICY DRUMS OF HEAVEN (140/5) - The only thing I could properly finish. A typical batter fried chicken. Almost south Indian and spicy in taste, but the coating was too thick.

üçó CHICKEN SUCCULENT YAKITORI (130) - 3 skewers with tiny chicken chunks, spring onion stem and a sesame seed drizzle. Texture was good, but taste, average. Sticky barbeque sauce coating it felt like.

üçó CHICKEN MOMOS (130/5) - Standard, good amount of filling, with a very pungent ginger flavor. The coating was thick too. Chilli chutney served alongside was not too spicy, and went well with the Momos.

üêΩ BOSAM (170) - It was my first time trying pork belly, and I can't really judge, but it felt fatty and gooey. The pieces were drenched in grease. Served with spicy kimchi which I loved.

üçú CHICKEN RAMYUM NOODLES (180) - Big bowl of noodles, what looked like Maggi but was only a close resemblance. Scarce chicken pieces, undercooked, dry and hard noodles, and overall a very bland taste.

üêü NAGA STEAM FISH (250) - This was the thing causing the smell in the restaurant. And I couldn't tolerate it. A very very pungent and strong odor. The fish had a great texture and was steamed to perfection. Served with steamed white rice.

Whatever I mentioned about the food, was just my impression, and maybe because it was the first time trying out this new cuisine, I didn't really like it.

However, one thing that was disappointing was the service. It was slow and just took ages. Once the food arrived, it was fine but again the bill took more than 20 minutes.

As many others have already said, I guess, the strong point of this place is their pork preparations, and I would recommend this place purely for that. An elaborate menu with lots of options, priced well.

Here's my overall SCORE:
Food - 3.5/5 (not judging what I tried first time/don't know about)
Ambience - 4/5 (get a room freshener!)
Service - 3/5

Many items on the menu were not available even on weekend and we settled for veg clear soup, mushroom & spinach soup to start with. The quantity of soups was a bummer and it was a huge bowl quarter filled with soup. If they plan to serve this quantity then they should switch to smaller bowls to atleast give illusion of a filled bowl. Mushroom & spinach soup tasted like Maggi /Knorr soup and not fresh.
For starters we opted butter pepper garlic prawn. It was served in a small plate with even smaller portion. 5 tiny prawns for starter definitely doesn't justify. The taste was average , better than soup.
For main course we decided Dotsol Bibimbap and Naga Chicken curry. Main course was way better in taste and we really liked Bibimbap. Naga chicken was good in taste but had mostly bones.
The portion size is major disappointment here and its evident across all courses. Another point of concern is their service.

Beef Soba Noodles and Teriyaki Chicken Rice alongwith Roasted Chilly Lamb and each one was competing with the other for a place in our hearts. The beef had a lovely texture and was well cooked. It was a tad on the bland side but tasted great nevertheless.

Food: 4/5 The pork dishes are awesome and the noodles were delicious. This is one place where though your stomach is full your heart wants more. Only thing I do not like is the noodle that they use. Feels like instant noddles and I feel this could be better.

Service: 3/5 Service is very slow. They seem to be a family run restaurant and sometimes (which is more often than not) when they are busy Service can be very slow. They have to very soon hire some more helping hand if they continue to experience this much of demand.

Ambiance :  3.5/5 Simple and minimalist interiors of a north eastern roadside joint.

The pork belly, veggies and kimchi are to be placed on the lettuce leaf and wrapped. This combination is delicious and you would love it. Next we had smoked pork ribs which i assume had barbecue sauce and sesame seeds and tastes pretty soft tender and yum. The beef curry and steamed rice was decent but extremely spicy. You can specify how spicy you want your dish and they can suggest or customise their dishes.
Ambience is nothing but ordinary and it draws a decent crowd even on weekdays.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Aparajita Chowdhury,"We went on a weekend to this place as we had been wanting to try out this new place in town for a while.

Starting of with the pros, the decor and ambiance of this place is really good. The menu is quite interesting too, and includes a variety of chicken, pork, beef and some fish dishes. There are a few vegetarian options, but I do not know to what extent it would satisfy a vegetarian. They have a good choice of mocktails as well, and each one was really good. The pork ribs and the mushrooms were good too. The staff there was good too.

Moving on to why I chose to give this a bad review- first of all, the service was really slow. Took about an hour for my food to arrive. Moreover, my chicken noodles tasted exactly like Maggie with a few chicken pieces thrown in. I had attached a picture of it for reference. Moreover the portion sizes are quite small in relation to the price of the dishes. A small bowl of beef curry was 200 and one plate of steamed rice was not even enough for two people. Even though the taste was good, because of the portion sizes and the relative prices plus the service time our experience was ruined.

1. Costly place and not much appreciated for students.

3. Quantity is not much appreciated but kinda okay but not all dishes.
4. They had less staff.

So done with the negative part and the positive thing is that you get to have pork there which is rare in this area and the food is not that great but kinda okay. If you wanna try something new and also spend some extra bucks then go for it. Not much of a satisfactory feeling here. 2 stars for the delays and less quantity of food in fat ass price.

Folks at the restaurant were least bothered in taking our order right since we sat down on an empty table.

Although I won't judge the restaurant based on just this item, as chances are it was a one off case. But the service and staff attitude was a real put off.

For the drink I had Vanilla Macchiato, the drink was way different from illustration. It lacked the caramel sauce on top and almost had no taste of vanilla, we also ordered for classic macchiato which tasted the same. So there was no vanilla in my coffee.

Dunkin' Donuts,Trishna M,"Landed up here on a Saturday night after shopping a couple of stuff. Following summaries my experience below-:

Ambiance- The ambiance is of a coffee shop and quite a typical one of Dunkin. The walls seemed somewhat empty as compared to the Dunkin outlets I have been to in Pune and Mumbai. Ample seating for say 30 people. 3.5/5

Service- You pay at the counter and he will hear your doughnuts and you take them yourself to your seat. It is an entirely self service type of mode. Nothing extraordinary. 3/5

Food- We tried the following two doughnuts-:

Kit kat doughnut- The doughnut was very fresh but the kit kat taste was okayish, not exactly of it. The chocolate factor was also less. The freshness and the typical dough taste gives this a 4/5.

Mango doughnut- Literally no taste of mango but again the yummy freshness dough taste which won my heart. Just for that 3/5.

Will I come here again? I like just one here which is Ugly Strawberry. Do try that if you like strawberries.",3,"316 Reviews , 1156 Followers",8/22/2018 15:32,1,,"{'food': ['Kit kat doughnut', 'Mango doughnut'], 'drink': []}"

Dunkin' Donuts,TJ'sTravel&Food,"It took me so long to pen down this review, 6 days to be exact! And why you ask. Well that's because I had to taste 6 donuts in all.

Yess, I decided to try the festive Rakhi donut box that comes with 6 mini Donuts ranging from death by chocolate, chocolate filled, mango flavored, two classics, etc. All this priced at Rs 199 plus taxes. This roughly came out to Rs 243.

So much goodness in one box!

Now I can't name each of the Donuts but I can say that majority were chocolate based. Of the 6 donuts, 2 were classic style and rest 4 were filled ones.

The first one was the classic sugar coated. Simple and goody good.

The second one was a chocolate coated classic donut. This one was fine.

Next up the mango flavored one. This one had a mango glaze on top and center filled with mango puree or jam. This was a fresh taste after so much chocolate.

The fourth one I think was death by chocolate. This one had a delicious chocolate coating on top and center filled with gooey chocolate.

The fifth one had a chocolate topping but cream filling. This one was ok.

The last one again had a chocolate topping and a vanilla filling. This one was good. The topping had some sprinkles too.

All in all a sinful treat for all donut heads out there.
Definitely a must try.

Breaking away from my usual style of writing I will come to the location and ambience after the food.
So this outlet is located on the ground floor of SLN terminus. Very easy to locate. The board is visible from the road.

The interiors like other Dunkin Donuts outlets is quirky with pop colour furniture and interesting wall designs. On a Sunday afternoon the place was moderately crowded.

Dunkin' Donuts,Sudheer Reddy,"It's a new kinda place for new kinda food which is donuts. I liked the donuts but the beverages(hot & cold) are not upto the mark.

Ratings:

Food and quality: 3.5/5 (above average)
Service at the counter: 2.5/5 (below avg)
Ambience & seating: 3/5 (average)
Overall: 3/5

The service is very bad and the reputation of such shops are going down because they're treating all the customers as those low class business meet holding people in Hyderabad.

However the taste of the beverages is very bad. The below are the beverages we tried.

1. Tough guy cappuccino

Food : 4.5/5 The Litti Cokha is just amazing, sitting in Hyderabad and getting such quality food that reminds you of your home town stalls is really something. Would have been nicer if the Chokha was a bit more hotter/spicy. But understand that such taste would not go well with lot of foodies here.

Service : 3.5/5 It was a self service join which now services your table. Timely service and good behavior there is very little more to expect.

Ambiance : 3/5 Has a very nicely maintained outdoor sitting beside road.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Pavan Rishit Meka,"This is a newly opened restaurant in Gachibowli. It is famous for it's Nizami style of cuisine. It is very spacious and has a cozy ambience with good music.

Dishes that we have tried:

1. Chicken Hot & Sour Soup
2. Chicken Manchow Soup
3. Eight Treasure Soup
4. Chicken Platter
5. Daawat Khaas Sabz Kebab Platter
6. Daawat Khaas Murgh Musallam
7. Zafrani Roti
8. Paneer Pasanda
9. Kaddu Ki Kheer

The food served here is delicious and mouth-watering. The pictures of the famous dishes served here are displayed in the LCD Tv's. Just the pictures themselves will activate all your taste buds. If you are going with a group of 6-8 members, I suggest you order platters instead of individual starters.

We have ordered Chicken Platter and Daawat Khaas Sabz Kebab Platter. The chicken Platter comes with 4 variety of chicken starters with 6 pieces for the each variety. And Veg platter is served with Paneer Tikka Kebab, Tandoori Broccoli and starter of cauliflower. Both veg and Non-veg platters tasted great.

In the main course we have ordered the famous dish of this restaurant *Daawat Khaas Murgh Musallam* It comes with chicken marinated with ginger garlic paste and stuff with eggs and mutton keema. Leaving the Hyderabad biryani aside, this was the best main course item that I have tried in the recent times. It easily serves for 3-4 adults. And it is really a must try dish if you're visiting this restaurant. Apart from that we have ordered Paneer Pasanda with zafrani Roti. The Paneer Pasanda curry tasted little bit sweet and none of us have liked it.

And coming to desserts we have ordered Kashmiri Rabdi and Kaddu ki Kheer. Both of them are really good.

Service:

The service here is really commendable. The staff is cordial and always available at your service. Within no time from ordering they serve the food hot at your plate.

Value for money:

I can't comment on the vegetarian food but for the non vegetarians this restaurant is a treat and the prices are worthy enough. We can try a variety of dishes which we haven't even encountered in the menu of regular Hyderabad restaurants. So mark it and visit this place for your next dining.

Hyderabadi Daawat, A New place in town located at Gachibowli. A place know from serving pure authentic Hyderabadi cuisine! And this has been in my list to visit since this place opened.

Talking about the Ambiance, It's gorgeous, simple and spacious with beautiful Interiors and great flighting.

We were here for lunch and since it was our First visit, we were confused what to order, then we asked the management to send their Signature dishes.

But before that since it was very hot, we ordered for Mocktails.
Strawberry Mojito, Virgin mojito, blue Hawaii, Soda fountain and Mango mule were among the Mocktails we had, They're amazing and refreshing!

Started with Yakhni shorba: Very delicious, Mutton was Cooked properly. Soup was Served very Hot!

Murg Sholay Kebabs: The signature Starter of this Place, very well presented with the Mini BBQ sizzling grills. The chicken was Little hard, should've cooked for a Little Longer.

Wok tossed chicken: Chicken was soft and Tender tossed in sauces, Little sweet. Chopped with Bell peppers and spring onions of Topping. Absolutely delicious.

Phuket Fish: One of the best fishes I had recently, very soft perfectly cooked, Slightly spicy. A Must try.

Sikanderi Raan: the House Speciality! The most Tender meat I've ever had in life, Probably the best you'll get in Hyderabad. Very tender, Full of Masalas and loaded with Ghee. The Marination for the Whole Raan is done 24 hours before and then roasted and served on table. Highly recommended!

Chelo Kebabs: Another House Speciality, The Kebabs were tender, Smokey and Delicious. Served along with Mild Flavoured rice, grilled tomatoes, Sunny side up and salad . A perfect platter for 2 people!

Murg Musallam: I've had this in many places, didn't really like it, But here it was one of the bests I had in the city. Though it takes 30 minutes to cook, it was worth waiting. The whole chicken is stuffed with Minced Meat and Boiled Eggs! Chicken is marinated with many spices and Curd Mainly. Cooked very perfectly, tender and Absolute scrumptious. Served along with flavoured rice! Highly recommended and The Best Murg masallam you'll ever find!

Chicken Tikka Lababdar: Scrumptious, Slightly spicy, chicken cooked right to perfect. No Colors added in the gravy, Just Delicious!

Nihari Gosht: I usually don't order mutton gravies from restaurants, But I had Faith in this palace that they serve good meat. As their mutton starters were excellent, even from the Main course this gravy was Scrumptious. Spicy and mutton cooked perfectly. We had these 2 Delicious curries with Hot Butter Naans! I would Recommend these 2 curries, A Must try!

Mutton Biryani: Very Flavourful, meat was perfectly. Rice grains were of a good quality! Just that they added a Lot of cardamom in it, with which the Biryani gave a Strong Flavour. Tasted pretty good.

Ended the Day with Desserts: Hot Shahi Tukda and Matka Firni. Both tasted Delicious, They weren't too sweet. Perfect to end our day.

Outstanding and Fantastic experience at Hyderabadi Daawat, One of the places to serve authentic Hyderabadi cuisine, No Colors and preservatives. Hope This place will never disappoint! It was worth travelling 25 KM's to visit this place. The staff was Humble and took good care of us.",5,"137 Reviews , 1563 Followers",3/17/2019 13:06,32,,"{'food': ['Yakhni Shorba', 'Murg Sholay Kebabs', 'Wok Tossed Chicken', 'Phuket Fish', 'Sikanderi Raan', 'Chelo Kebabs', 'Murg Musallam', 'Chicken Tikka Lababdar', 'Nihari Gosht', 'Mutton Biryani'], 'drink': ['Strawberry Mojito', 'Virgin mojito', 'Blue Hawaii', 'Soda fountain', 'Mango mule']}"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Tummyful_hyd,"Hyderabadi Daawat as the name suggests has some authentic Hyderabadi food which you get to eat in the functions here in Hyderabad! Ever been to a Hyderabadi Daawat before? No not the hotel we're talking about a function, well if you've been to one then You definitely know how much a Hyderabadi loves food and how much he spends on the Menu! And here at Hyderabadi Daawat, the restaurant, you get the same splendid variety of dishes to enjoy! The hotel is very easy to locate! Its on the main road...while coming from ORR or Gachibowli side it comes on the right side and if you're coming from Miyapur side then it will be on Your left! The restaurant has simple yet beautiful interiors, very calm and cozy place! They also have Banquet hall and a Conference hall and they also undertake Catering orders for parties and functions! And after the ""DASTAR"" was set we sat down for the food and they first brought the YAKHNI SHORBA! Shorba is nothing but the soup! Yakhni Shorba is a dish from Kashmir...people in the North tend to have it more! And it is a very good source of protein! Usually it is mild in spice level but at Hyderabadi Daawat owing to the spice cravings of Hyderabadis it was made a little spicy! But the taste was fantastic! It was the best way to start off Your meal! Next came the starters in which we were served the Wok tossed chicken, Phuket fish, Sikandari Raan and Murgh Sholay kebab! Let's start with what we loved the most: The Sikandari Raan! ‚ù§ It's one whole leg from the Goat or Sheep! You know for a fact that Mutton and Beefs aren't usually as tender as Chicken but the chefs at Hyderabadi Daawat changed this notion entirely! The mutton from the Raan was soo soft tender and juicy that Your teeth has no work to do...cause it just MELTS! And talking about the spices...it was very mild in spice and very well marinated! Coming to the significance of the name SIKANDARI RAAN! Most of You must be knowing that Alexander the Great who had captured almost all parts of the world was known as Sikandar e Azam! After winning one of the battles in 300 B.C at Takshila he took the ruler called Porus as captive and when Porus was asked what he wanted He told he wanted them to treat him like a king and soo Alexander or Sikandar took him as his friend and arranged for a lavish buffet in which this Raan was signature dish! And since then it is named as Sikandari Raan! Well, we think no other name would have justified the Size and Taste of this dish better than Sikandari Raan! A must must have for You all! Highly recommended dish if You're here! üòç The next best starter was the Phuket fish! It's a nice spicy fish coated with finely chopped onions, ginger garlic paste and tossed in Soya and Chilli sauce! The taste was of another level! Next we had the Wok tossed chicken! Wok tossed is an East Asian style of cooking where they use woks or metal pans with shallow bowls used for frying or steaming! The taste of the chicken was really good with all rightly mixed flavours and spices but it was a bit hard to chew! Soo we recommend the chef to look into that! And next came the Murgh Sholay Kebab! It was the Barbeque styled chicken! Very nicely marinated and tender to eat! And the presentation was amazingly done! üëåüèª After we were done with the starters they brought a very appealing and extremely beautiful dish called Chelo Kebab! It was extremely well presented! Chelo kebab is an Iranian Dish in which there is cooked rice along with varieties of chicken kebabs! The chicken and the rice as well is too mild in spice but rich in flavour! After this the main course was started in which we were served the Chicken Lababdar, Nihari Gosht, and Murgh Musallam with Butter Naan! Nihari Gosht was Love! ‚ù§ it wasn't like the usual Nihari that You eat on a regular basis! It was different and very thick and spicy! And the mutton which they used was really tender! Do try this dish here! Chicken lababdar was really lababdar along with the butter naan it was a perfect combo! üòç Murgh Musallam was completely different here when compared to the Murgh Musallam we had at other places! Here they serve the Murgh Musallam with rice! And the meat is filled with minced mutton and eggs! You should definitely try this dish! ‚ù§ We were done with all this but how can You even think that a Hyderabadi daawat would end without the Hyderabadi Biryani? We had the Mutton Biryani it was very rich in flavours and seasoned with good amount of roasted onions! The aroma of the Ghee added to the taste of the Biryani! üòçüòç And the Daawat came to an end with the desserts You commonly find in a Hyderabadi Daawat...Matka Firni and Double ka Meetha! Double ka Meetha is the very usual dish You see in the functions of Hyderabad! It is made with roasted breads to which milk cinnamon and almond powder are added! And at Hyderabadi Daawat it was perfectly made and was served Hot! ‚ù§ Overall the lunch here was a Terrific experience and we all just loved it! And also a special mention to the Owner of this place who is a very Kind hearted and a humble person! He speaks to You related anything and everything You have to ask or tell and takes the Feedback whether good or bad with a smile!

Hyderabadi Daawat,Tavleen Kaur Gandhi,"This place is only a few months old. It's true that Hyderabad is filled with various food places that serve different cusines, mainly there are n number of Cafe's, bars, food joints. The new culture has out shined the basic restaurant culture.
Hyderabadi Daawat is that place which will bring back your memories of going to a restaurant to enjoy a good sumptuous meal with your family or friends.
It excells in real flavours used in Hyderabadi dishes and will make your mouth water for their signature dishes.
Starting with the mocktails section, there is a huge variety. From the basic mojitos to the flavoured ones. The signature mocktails and a must try outs are Mango Bloom, Soda Fountain and Strawberry Mojito.
Coming to the starters, it's the best to begin with some soup. Yakhni Shorba is the best try out soup.
Phucket fish, wok tossed chicken and Sholay Kebabs are the other three delicacies in the starters menu. Sikandari Raan.. the signature item from the menu is the show stealer. The presentation is so lovely that would not let you take a picture of it but to devour it immediately.
Heading to the main course, Hyderabadi cuisine is incomplete without biryani. This place has amazing Mutton biryani which is flavoured so well. The aroma is literally breathtaking. Chicken Tikka lababdar and Nihari Ghost are the other curry options which should be tried in the main course along with butter naan. The main ""main-course"" is Murg Massalam, a whole chicken stuffed with lamb and eggs. This dish was superb in taste as well as presentation. After a full on meal desserts are a must. Matka Firni and Double ka meetha were amazing here and should be eneded with after the meal.
The staff here is very polite and friendly. The ambience is serene and calm,goes well while having your meal here. The place has a huge space of sitting area. The indoors are done very finely with good cravings on the ceiling.

The ambience, service, food were really gr8. Was really happy to dine at this hidden gem. Ordered Paya shorba which was deliciously made. Succulent paya with equally tasty shorba. For starters we ordered murgh ke Sholay, Phuket fish, rounakhi sheekh kebabs. Every item was a revelation. Gr8 care had been given to maintain the authenticity of each item. For mains we ordered chelo kebab and murgh musallam. Chelo kebab was presented with chicken kebab, and sheekh kebab with tasty ruce. It being a Persian dish, rice was little bland which was complemented perfectly by the combination of both the kebabs. Perfect. And the murgh musallam was as perfect as it could be.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Venkatesh Kumar,"Looking at the overall rating & the close promixity to our office, visited this place for lunch along with my team today. Looks like this place is mainly for IT people as most of it is occupied by 3 batches ( 12+). Nothing great to say about the interiors, ambiance it is decent enough. I am the odd man out in the group being the only vegetarian, but will put in words what my colleagues said about the non veg food.

Veg: Not that great, we ordered Panneer tikka & palak sheek kebab for starters, Sabzi Nawabi Handi & butter naan for mains. Panneer is rubbery & not soft indicating it is not fresh. Palak sheek kebab is kind of bland with no taste & not cooked properly. As suggested by the staff, we opted for Sabzi Nawabi Handi which is a bad decision as the taste is not that good. Service wise, they took lot of time in getting our order which is a let down as well.

Non veg: Sikendari Raan is a standout dish whereas the other Murg Musallam is bland with no taste/spiceness to it. Same is the case with Yakhni Shorba which tasted like hot gravy water.

Overall I would not suggest anyone to visit this place considering the inconsistency in the food they served along with bad service.",3,"87 Reviews , 168 Followers",2/1/2019 17:45,5,,"{'food': ['Panneer tikka', 'Palak sheek kebab', 'Sabzi Nawabi Handi', 'Yakhni Shorba'], 'drink': []}"

Rice was quite plain and don't have masala, however it looks amazing but lacks the flavour. there is one thing called less masala or spices but rice here was actually more on the bland side, rice quality was superb but taste was missing which usually Hyderabadi Biryani have. Mirch ka Salan was decent so as the raita, chicken pieces were having some masala and spices but somewhere some of the pieces were little raw from inside and not completely cooked. When eaten with mirch ka Salan and pieces then only there was little bit of taste otherwise it wasn't decent enough also. Ordered from Zomato on special prices otherwise the price tag which they have is high.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Mohd Zubair Ali (Hyderabad.Food.Diaries),"I am a huge fan of regional cuisines. The diversity in our regional cuisines exhibits so much about the range India possess. It also talks about the immense depth in terms of culture and it‚Äôs just a festival of flavors. Cities especially witness the change in the culture and places like Hyderabad is an amalgamation of so many from the Nizams, Rayalseema to telugu cuisines.

Hyderabadi Dawaat is one such place which is trying to restore the age old tradition and bring back the cuisine of Nizams. From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights and I was really excited to go for it.

As I went in for a dinner, we started with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba, a great start to the meal. With every sip, the intense flavor starts to get you. Then there was an array of appetizers that really got me. We had the Achaari Paneer Tikka, where pieces of paneer were marinated in a flavorful tangy achaari mix. For the non vegetarians, we had Murgh Kalmi Kebab where the chicken leg pieces were marinated in a balanced spice mix. The Gosht Seekh Kebab was wonderful as well. It was juicy mutton kebabs and lastly the Patrani Fish. The fish was perfectly cooked and the flavors of coconut cream enhanced the taste.

The restaurant also took the pain to present us their special Sikandari Rann, where a whole leg of lamb is marinated with whole spices and then cooked in a tandoor. It was served on a bed of fried onions, garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side. Every single element from that whole ensemble stood out for me and made my day. Moreover, there were also some Persian Chelo kebabs and Murgh Mussallum for us to enjoy, served along with their range of condiments.

 The Rann was not enough and the restaurant decided to bring more stuff for us. We had Gosht Masala, Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which was served alongside with some piping hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans. The Nargisi Kofta was my favourite of the night. It just had the right balance of flavors and made me go gaga over it. The Gosht Masala was spicy but the Achari Chicken was incredible too. Desserts like Gil-e-Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal.

In a nutshell, the true culture and authentic flavors of Hyderabad is being exhibited here. So, Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list!

Hyderabadi Daawat,Kamaal Ahmed (zaiqebaaz),"Ask anyone what you like about Hyderabad the most, the answer is always Food! Hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in India! Irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, Hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! But where to eat in Hyderabad? As an ardent foodie, I get this question asked, all the time. So to my non-Hyderabadi friends I have always been recommending legendary Irani restaurants for Biryani and or any Hyderabadi dish. Because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!

But that has changed now. Thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. Now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic Biryani. The legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! In the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the Cyberabad area.

One such new entrant is Hyderabadi Dawat. It is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! And its evident in their authentic Hyderabadi food.

Hyderabadi Daawat is located at Gachibowli-Kondapur road. It is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. Just how Hyderabadis like it! The menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a Nawabi Hyderabadi Wedding reception!

We were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! We started with a Mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker!

 The starters started with Achari Paneer Tikka which was surprisingly good. Though not their forte, it had perfect Taste and softness! The veg Shami was another great starter! The only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!

Then came the first non-veg starter, the Murgh Kalmi Kebab! Chicken Thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. It had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! It was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!

Then came Seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. Because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! But this one at Hyderabadi Daawat made me feel like home! It had the perfect Hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. Had a proper Seekh Kebab after a long time!

Tandoori Jhinga was just good! Nothing great but then no flaws either!

Their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!

The first one was the Sikandari Raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! It was one hell of a royal dish! But the meat could have been cooked more. In fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.

The second khaas peshkash was Chelo Kebab Platter! A Persian delicacy that consists of Rice, a Seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! This dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! Nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. Not very spicy though!

Finally, it was time for the king of them all, the Murgh Musallam. A Mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. Then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. It is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. See the pics and decide for yourself!

That was our Nawabi Hyderabadi Daawat at this royal restaurant!

I'm glad the Hyderabadi Cuisine is now going fine dine!

The taste was awesome and chicken was properly tandoored. In the same course we ordered the usual tandoori roti and Murg tikka lababdar. Murg tikka was awesome, it was not too spicy nor too blunt, it was perfect gravy with boneless chicken.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Junaid Aziz,"'Say no more!'

Food - The name itself will get any Hyderabadis taste buds jiggle! And certainly it stood up to it's name, the food here was delectable!

I'll list out my favorites first, In the starters I just fell in love with the Murgh Kalmi Kebab, chicken leg pieces marinated in not so spicy mixture, it was delicious and it is a #musttry on my list! I jumped ahead a lil without mentioning the soup because murgh kalmi was magical, likewise Yakhni Shorba (Indianized Mutton Soup) was a great way to get things started! It had the perfect balance of flavours and that subtle amount black pepper does a great job! Sabz Ki Shaami, a mashed vegetable mixture, fried in oil, served with mayonnaise and mint chutney was a good light vegetarian starter. Paneer Achari Kebab wasn't the softest and also the sides were burnt a lil so they need to work on this, otherwise the flavor is pretty good! Gosht Sheekh Kebab, a classic, the salt levels were perfect and the meat was really tender, felt it was a bit dry though. Patrani Fish, wrapped inside a banana (I'm guessing) leaf, was topped with a layer of mint chutney, although the fish was heavenly, I'd love it to be served without the layering of the chutney! Tandoori Jhinga was again beautifully done and it is the second #musttry starter!

The drinks got mixed reactions! Well 60% of them being below average and another 40% being extraordinary, it was a rollercoaster in this dept.! We gave the review to the management regarding the basic ones and soon after that they presented us Cinderella, Caramel Mint Mojito and Mint Cooler which just blew us all away! I hope they maintain the same consistency in other mocktails as well!

The main course had us dying! We were already so full and there was plenty of food left! Gosht Achari, Murgh Achari, the former being a lil more spicier, were just classic dishes being served and when you combine them with nicely done butter naans, there's nothing better than this combination! Nargisi Kofta was another curry, couldn't differentiate much when compared to the other two.

Special mention goes to 'Sikendari Raan' for ‚Çπ1490, it was a treat to watch this magnificent charred leg piece of a lamb on a plate with oozing juices and scrumptious sides! If you're a lamb lover then it is something that'll satisfy all your Mutton cravings! Food gets a solid 10/10! Need to work on the drinks though!

Ambiance - It is a huge property just opposite to SLN Terminus. With ground and first floor seating, it has plenty of space to fill in atleast 130 people at once! Although the place is well lit, I didn't feel anything special being around because right now and always theme based restaurants will give more customer satisfaction rather than just a clean well lit place with good furniture! 'Hyderabadi Daawat' should incorporate anything and everything Hyderabad has to offer in it's culture as nobody else in that area are doing that! I had crazy ideas like making the waiters wear a classic Lungi, have Marfa (Hyderabadi Band Baaja) outside on the weekends, but the classy interiors just don't allow this to happen! Well you never know, I'm not saying that place is bad but they have to add an element of joy! Ambiance gets 8/10!

Service - It was decent! As they're pretty fresh in the market, they'll have to work rigorously to improvise according to the customers taste! The food arrived in an ample time and the table was being cleared every now and then! I'd like every person around to know each and every dish on the menu because due to the unusual names the crowd there will feel disconnected and not know what to order! The waiters, butlers need to push the specials everyday rather than just leaving it on the vast menu they have! Overall service gets 8/10!

Hyderabadi Daawat,Manaswini Buddappagari,"It's always good to see restaurants which focus on Hyderabadi cuisine since it's so diverse and encompasses a lot of different varieties within it. Hyderabadi Daawat does justice to it's name but treating us to good Hyderabadi food.

The restaurant is located on the Gachibowli - Kondapur mainroad with convenient parking. The interiors are classy and comfortable.

The dish that started off the Daawat was the Yakhni Shorbha which was meticulously done - spicy, meaty and the meat was literally falling apart from the bone.
Achari paneer - seasoned with pickle masalas and was just cooked to perfection.
Sabz ki Shami - the textures felt a little strange to me.
Tandoori Aaloo- soft and fluffy stuffed potatos with crispy grilled skins on the exterior
Murgh Kalmi kebab - marinated chicken in mild spices grilled to perfection in a tandoor.
Gosht Seekh Kebab- it is extremely easy to dry out a Seekh Kebab but they nail it here.
Patrani fish and tandoori Jhinga needed a improvement as they lacked depth of flavour and taste.
Their main course comprised of Murgh Mussalam, Nargisi Kofta, Achari Murgh, Shahi Paneer, Dal Akbari, Gosht Masala.
Their Sikandari Raan and Murgh Mussalam deserve a special mention.
A variety of mocktails are available out of which my personal favourites happen to be the Lemon mint cooler, Cinderella ( slightly on the sweeter side) and Coco Baliney.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Unsophisticated Foodies,"The name is a giveaway here! This place specialises in Hyderabadi cusinie and we were here for a food review session.
Ambience- Decent with ample space. It's a fine dine place you can visit with your family.
Food- This place has lots of splendid non vegetarian options but being a vegetarian, my review revolves around their veg food and beverages.

The food was well prepared and presented overall. I liked the achari paneer tikka in starters. Shahi paneer was my favourite among the main course that went well with their mix roti Basket. Two of my favourite beverages from the evening were Caramel Mojito and Lemon Mint.

The menu is vast and really reasonable. Do not miss this place if you like Hyderabadi cusinie. Even if you're not a fan, do give them a chance as they have a lot to offer at really humble rates.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Yash Kumar Singh,"I have always been a fan of regional cuisines of India for their immense depth in terms of culture as well as tradition. And its not just the flavours on the taste buds, its almost as if you could taste the history of a civilization. And with the imprint Nizams have left on the city of Hyderabad in every aspect, it doesn't even come as a surprise as to why there are an unnumerable amount of dishes in Hyderabadi cuisine.

Hyderabadi Dawaat is one new joint in Gachibowli area which is trying to bring back the cuisine of Nizams by serving dishes from our very favourite Hyderabadi cuisine to the best of its authenticity. From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights.

Coming to the food, I went in for a dinner to sample out their menu with some of my friends where we began the meal with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba which was a flavour-pumped version of a simple mutton shorba and an awesome start to the meal. With every sip, the flavour became increasingly intense with the hearty mutton tartness on the back of the tongue.

Then came an array of appetizers both for the veg as well as non veg. From the vegetarian ones, I personally loved the Achaari Paneer Tikka which had soft pieces of paneer marinated in a balanced pickle spice mix which had just the right amount of tanginess to it. From the non vegetarian menu there were quite a few who made to my favourites including the Murgh Kalmi Kebab - chicken leg pieces marinated heavy handedly in spice and finished in tandoor to perfection, Gosht Seekh Kebab - plain old mutton kebabs with juicy, succulent mutton mince and Patrani Fish - fish covered in a subtle coconut based marinade, wrapped in cabbage and finished in tandoor.

From among the specialties from the area, the restaurant presented us with their Sikandari Rann which was a whole leg of lamb marinated with whole spices like cloves, cinnamon, pepper and cashew nut, finished slowly in a tandoor and served on a bed of fried onions and garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side. Each element of the dish was beautiful with the lamb taking the center stage - tender, juicy and delicious. In a similar fashion, restaurant also serves specialty big platters like Chelo Kebabs which is a Persion styled serving of Mutton and Chicken Kebabs on a bed of Saffron Rice and Murg Mussallam which had a whole chicken doused in a delicious ginger garlic marinade and cooked till tender, served again on a bed of rice.

Even after the Rann, the show wasn't over and we went in for mains trying out their Gosht Masala, Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which went really well with some hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans. Nargisi Kofta was my favourite one which had the same delicious mutton keema wrapped around boiled eggs and tossed in a rich spicy onion-tomato gravy. Gosht Masala was a tiny bit more spicier that the Kofta and had flavourful bone-in mutton pieces. With the Achari Chicken, the restaurant again showed excellence in terms of balance of flavour as the dish wasn't too tangy as preparations in most of the other restaurants turn out to be. Gil-e-Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal with a sweet note, both of which were less of sugar and actually quite good.

The service here at Hyderabadi Dawaat was just as good as their food. The staff was warm and corteous and took care of each and every need for us diners be it a glass of water or a change of plates. I was highly impressed with the kitchen which though took time to deliver the dishes to the table but also put in extreme care to provide us only what was the best. In a nutshell, if you want to experience the true cultural heritage of Hyderabad on a plate, Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list!

Hyderabadi Daawat,Hyderabadfoodexplorer (sanchay Gumidelli),"So the place is named as Hyderabadi Daawat, is actually not just hyderabadi food. They have turned this up to a multi cuisne serving hyderabadi , mughlai , oriental and a bit of continental. We though here were just to try the mughlai , a bit of hyderabadi and a little north Indian style of food. Lets check them out. #hyderabadfoodexplorer #letsexplorehyderabad ...

Hyderabadi Daawat,Karthik Gandhi,"Hyderabadi Cuisine as such is vast and rich in heritage with its deep roots into the tradition(s) like any other cuisine. Generations after generation, the cuisine has transformed into more commercial and all we know is few kebabs and dum biryani are the cuisine as such. But there is more than just biryani and kebab(s). Once you get to taste real authentic dishes, you will tend to know the richness and diversified delicacies from the land of Nizams. You always tend to get such delicacies towards the other part of the city and what the Cyberabad gets its morphed or rather mostly morphed delicacies. Wait no more as kondapur-gachibowli has got what it has been missing for quite a while. Hyderabadi Daawat opened up recently has a clear agenda of serving authentic dishes to commercial crowd and give them more above and beyond than the regular kebab(s) and biryani. 

My dinner session today had no expectation(s) from it but then the food spoke for itself. Restaurant should be proud to serve some delicacies which you don't get that easily anywhere in vicinity.

Dishes like #MurghMussalam , #MurghKalmiKebab, #CheloKebab, #PatraniFish, #GoshtMasala, #SikanderRaan and many more. While a few dishes went amiss to excite me, all other dishes were completely unique flavors and not quite relatable to palate that's used to typical tandoor/kebab(s). 

Must Try : #AchariChicken, #GoshtMasala, #KalmiKebab, #PaneerAchari, #DalAkbari and #NargasiKofta

Do focus on such rare delicacies when you go dine there and avoid the regular run around the mill dishes and I'm sure you will appreciate the restaurant for bringing you the heritage of culture rich Hyderabadi Daawat Cuisine. I'm definitely impressed with the menu offerings and their service (Mainly Mr. Dilawar was so gracious)

Hyderabadi Daawat,Bismaya Kumar Purohit,"A newbie in the neighborhood calls for a visit and it was a Sunday afternoon we landed.

A quick confirmation via Zomato led to happy welcome as we enjoyed the ambiance and amazing hospitality by the courteous staff.

Menu card was well organized with tabs to make your way through it easier. Earned a 1/2 star!

Ordered Pathar-Gosht and Afghan Kebab as wanted to start off light. As surprising as it can be the Afghan Kebab turned to be the way an authentic kebab should be and not the imitation ones that are spread across cities. Pathar-Gosht was mouth watering as the aroma of the spices was blended perfectly and not to forget the accurate chunk sized that melted right away in the mouth. Another Star earned for Starters.

When in Hyd go for Biryani- So how couldn't we as we ordered Biryanis - Chicken and Mutton. Prompt service by the staff ensured we had them served on our plats without much waiting time !

Taste was good as they took care that the Biryani don't fry away our taste buds or bring tears down eye. Happy to have tasted an amazing blend of aroma and well coked mutton n chicken pieces. Spices were evenly distributed and the texture was smooth and appealing. The colours of the rice was perfectly blended as it reflected the Typical Hyderabadi style.

With tummies full we ordered Blue Mojito and it too scored as expected...Amazing. Time for a wrap up as the Manager Mr. Dilawar greeted us with his hospitality. A true Gentleman he was as he assisted my family all throughout.

My View: An amazing yet serene restaurant to visit with Family and friends. Located conveniently in Main road to Gachibowli, Daawat is a must try if you're around or visiting Hyd. When in Daawat- don't forget to try their Pathar-Gosht and not to forget the Amazing Raan they boast of being their super speciality.

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Sanskruti Mishra,"My husband and I, visited Zega for their dimsum festival and we were not disappointed.
The service started with a delicious bowl of thukpa, which had a perfect blend of spice. Followed by an array of dimsums, each being delicious and warm. The chicken Gyoza was absolutely mind blowing. I could eat a zillion of those!
The dimsums (which we were full after) were followed by the main course which included fried rice/soft noodle with chicken and fish(we did not try the vegetarian dishes)
The cherry on the cake was the dessert! Toffee banana with ice Cream. Ugh! Delicious!!
Our bill was ~ 1700/- for 2

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Shreshth Malhotra,"Zega is a beautiful Pan Asian restaurant located amidst the lavish property of Sheraton Hyderabad. The restaurant has got a great ambiance to it and serves some of the authentic Pan Asian dishes that one could ask for.

I went there for their ongoing Dimsum food festival with my pals and had a great time overall. The Dimsum food festival had a variety of Thukpa options ranging from Chicken, Mutton, Pork and the veg version alongside some beautifully crafted dimsums inspired from China. Next up, there was an option for various wok tossed gravies and some delicious desserts.

The first thing to try out was their Chicken Thukpa. It was simply delicious. The broth was super special and it had a balanced proportion of sweet, spice and tang into it which was amazing. The amount of veggies and noodles were also quite balanced and overall, it was an absolute winner. This was something I personally recommend all of you to try.

Next up, we were offered some of their Dimsums. The showstopper of the day were Pan fried Chicken Gyoza, Pok choi roasted garlic and Napa Cabbage Crystals, Prawn crystal wraps and Vegetable beijing dumpling. The Prawn crystal wraps had a tad sweet soy used as a sauce which could have had a slight more kick to it otherwise all these are a must try.

For mains, we ordered for Wok tossed Chicken in Dry chilli cashews, Crispy fish in chilli plum sauce along side Vegetable fried rice and Vegetable wok tossed soft noodles. The Chicken in dry chilli cashwes was the clear winner of the lot and was simply wonderful. It was a tad saltier in the first serving but we got it amended thanks to the chef. Overall, the main course was good and had clean, authentic flavors.

With out tummies full and our satisfaction levels reached, we decided to go ahead with their Toffee banana with palm sugar ice cream. This was magical. I have been a lover of Toffee banana but this fusion right here was mind blowing. The creaminess of the palm sugar ice cream went on fantastically with the crispy banana toffee and was a big boost for our palate.

All in all, it is a place to sit back, relax and enjoy a great layout of Pan Asian food. The staff is highly cooperative and seeks a lot of feedback which is a great thing.

Special shoutout to the lady who mixes the drinks - a true professional. Her Nirvana cocktail is just that - sinful pleasure. I went there on consecutive weekends.

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Kaushik Nath,"There are places that deserve a 5 star but they're worth a single visit. This one's different. The restaurant experience was 5 star indeed and deserves multiple visits. The food taste and quality exceeded the expectations. The presentation was great. Nice and courteous waiting with quick service.

However, the security of the hotel (Sheraton) in which this marvellous diner was in, did not know that the hotel even had a restaurant called Zega. Also, there's no elevator from the underground parking space.

It was a 5 star experience for the restaurant, the ambience and the food. But I cannot say the same for the convenience at the main entrance.

Anyway. It's a must visit. I apologise for the 4 stars it easily deserves a 5. But, I really had no choice based on the inconvenience at the entrance.",4,"5 Reviews , 36 Followers",5/28/2018 22:20,0,,"{'food': ['food taste and quality exceeded the expectations'], 'drink': []}"

Being a 5 star restaurant some basic amenities were missing which you can easily get in any local drive in or a dhaba. Noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7-8 min, whereas in any other 5 star, a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry. However we went inside and opted for a buffet. The food spread was very good however, few of them were cold(roast chkn and fish tikka). The fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert. The most annoying thing was the on the table service. The table wasnt ready when we were seated. We had to ask for napkin, spoon, fork and even for a glass of water. Multiple times. The empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean.

Chinese Pavilion,George B.,"We love chinese food and we headed for Chinese Pavilion to have dinner on a Wednesday evening. We reached there by 7:30 and we were the first customers, by 8:30 onwards people started to fill the restaurant. It‚Äôs not difficult to find the place since is on the main road.

Ambiance is nice, the typical chinese music that goes on is kind of relaxing. Decors have chinese items so it‚Äôs not bad.

Service was spot on, we were attended very. It didn‚Äôt take much time for the food to come out from the kitchen.

For food we had Satay Chicken sticks and Spicy Black Bean Lamb for starters, Teppan Soba Noodles Sizzler for main course and cheesecake for desserts. The satay chicken was so tender that immediately fell from the skewers and melted in the mouth, really good. The Lamb was good but not wow. The noodles tasted awesome! It came sizzling, buttery and full of flavour. Usually in India is hard to find a decent cheesecake but for our surprise this one was really good so really a good culinary experience. The prices are a bit on the higher side but deserves a try definitely. Recommend!

This place has great ambience and decent staff. We ordered veg soup and chicken manchow soup they were good.

We then ordered garlic based noodles (cant remember the name), mongolian chicken and lime soda. The food was great but again, we found the mushrooms in the noodles not fresh and this made me quiet disappointed.
Overall i would say the food was great, a bit pricey though. I could not give a great rating because of the things mentioned above.",2,"12 Reviews , 2 Followers",11/25/2018 20:38,2,,"{'food': ['veg soup', 'chicken manchow soup', 'garlic based noodles', 'mongolian chicken'], 'drink': ['lime soda']}"

But we didn't really like it.

Hakka Noodles: Noodles tasted great. Really tasty, and quantity was really good.

Fresh lime soda: It was really good and refreshing.

Sea Wars : This appetizer was blend of fried prawns,fish and squid .The chilli soy sauce and sweet coriander sauce served on side added a wonderful touch to this delightful dish.

Fook Chook Fried Rice: White sauce (not cream based) topped Fried Rice had a subtle flavor.It was loaded with vegetables.

Honey Noodles with ice cream : Texture of the Noodles here was nothing like the ones I tasted earlier.Fried Noodles had a fudgy Texture with went along real well with thick creamy ice cream.
Fruit punch was decent.But pinacolda has to be improved.

This place was bookmarked for a long time now so I wanted to pay it a visit. And finally the moment came when I was actually able to go there. I am a huge fan of Indo-Chinese cuisine and I honestly had a high hope from this place but all in all it was disappointment. 

I ordered chicken manchow soup which was good although the salt was on the higher side. Hakka noodles and fried rice has too much oil and there's no reason for that amount of oil to be there in the Chinese food. 

Wolly chicken and chicken chilli dry had extreme amount of garlic which weren't properly fried and rather than giving a good taste, it made the entire dish difficult to eat as the flavour was overpowering. 

All in all, the food wasn't enjoyable.

#FoodShaukeen #ChinesePavilion

Chinese Pavilion was one place which was hiding in my wishlist for very long in Chinese category and this wish was fulfilled when a friend wanted to throw a party in a Chinese restaurant, and I wasted no time in suggesting this üòâ. Visited Gachibowli branch which is above CCD and is in the same building of Up the Bistro.
Their ambience does comply with their cuisine to most and their seating is quite comfortable and can seat up to 40 pax comfortably.
Pricing is a bit on higher end with most of the dishes are priced above 350 and very few are between 250 - 350 . A tummyful meal could go up to 1400 for 2 AI.
Have ordered Manchow soup to start our meal which satisfied our taste buds. Red Chilli Prawns (dry), BBQ chicken, three treasure veggies and honey glazed potato balls were part of appetizers. Prawns Teppan yaki, pan fried and tossed along with Chilli Garlic and butter tasted real good. BBQ chicken was a decent attempt and could have been more better. Show stealer among appetizers was definitely honey glazed potato balls which were delicious with a punch of sweet and a little pepperish, a wonderful combo to your taste buds. Three treasure veggies had broccoli, baby corn and mushrooms and felt more like a salad for me. Had it been a little more pan fried with its sauces, could have done wonders.
Among main course was schezwan fried rice and CP special noodles which is made of pan fried noodles and oyster sauce, tasted Okish as sauce did not impress me as much as I expected. Schezwan rice was delicious though, right to the spices. Requested for desserts and they dint have anything from their menu except honey noodles üòï.

Service : Though their service is quick, staff is not so attentive to the customer for the ad hoc requests and also to take order. Something that is important from customer point of view.

Bottomline : there were few misses and few hits. However, most of the dishes were towards sweeter side.

Chinese Pavilion,Sattam Ray,"Amazing food,good ambience & great service...this is what describes Chinese Pavilion. Their Chinese is blended in Indian flavors & that is what makes it so special! The chopsuey,all chicken non veg gravies are worth trying here along with fish/prawn starters. The best part about their food is it isn't bland,it is mixed with Indian flavors ensuring the Chinese name stays to it preventing it to be less spicy. If you want to try something different within the Chinese cuisine this place won't disappoint you. And the service is awesomely good as the servers there wont just serve you with a smile but also recommend their best dishes and can even customise your dishes as per your choice. I am going with a 4.5 because I beliebe the efforts put by their team should be appreciated and I request every foodie to visit this place. This is honestly one of the few Chinese places that serve chinese cuisine with an Indian touch.

Chinese Pavilion,Karthik Gandhi,"Chinese Cuisine including diverse styles from various parts of chine has not only influenced the food landscape in various parts of Asia but across the world. One of the most simple yet complicated in flavor profiles. India has also embraced so much of Asian cuisine that you can vouch that most of Indian Foodie community next to their regional cuisine would be fans of Chinese Cuisine. Chinese Pavilion is one of the most consistent brand in Hyderabad that you keep hearing for authentic no non-sense Chinese dishes at not to alarming prices and yet have strong fan following.  I for one of them was a fan as I dined here last year and fate had me to dine her with Fellow Foodie Bhais exactly after a year and I had to be blown away by the food only to believe that no wonder this place has been awarded The Best Chinese Restaurant 2016 from Times Of India .

Chinese Pavilion,@FuloriBinaChutneyKaiseBani,What a delightful place. Food was the star here and we were left literally grinning ear to ear by the end of it all. A feat considering how grumpy I was at prospect of consuming vegetarian food on account of Ganesh Chaturthy. But one sip of Vietnamese noodles soup later we were already celebrating. Halfway into Thai red curry/steamed rice I had already activated my man-vs-food mode but it all abruptly ended after my wife swiftly got everything parcelled.

Chinese Pavilion,Gopi Krishna,"Searched for Chinese cuisine nearby and I found this cuisine with better rating but with high costs. Thought of visiting this place and really it made my day.
As soup is one of my favorite dishes I started with Spicy Crab soup.
It was good but found something was missing in it.
I tried to do some modifications and added sugar and venigar which made it awesome.
Thai Basic chicken fried rice was good. Not that Spicy but I the rice was very dry. It might tasted better if it was bit wet.
Betki fish tossed in crab meat was very good.
That was a great experience with a great ambiance and good service.

I have visited its other branch in Banjara Hills many times and have always liked their food.... So wanted to give this branch a try.

Food here is great too..

Dishes ordered:
Pepper fried Paneer - I personally don't like starters if they are very crisp so couldn't enjoy it much....

Pan Fried Noodles - Amazing :) Loved it!!
Mushroom Pepper Chilly - Good but felt it didnt go very well with noodles

Chinese Pavilion,Deba Das,"Initially thought of going to Wonton (Gachibowli) but on recommendation from a friend arrived here for dinner. Restaurant is located near the Gachibowli highway on the 1st floor above CCD. Restaurant had nice interiors and we were greeted in a warm manner. The staffs were very courteous to explain us the dish details at the time of order. We ordered for POTATO BALL HONEY PEPPER SA, DUMPLINGS, VEGETABLE MANCHURIAN, VEGETABLE BLACK BEAN NOODLES, 3 TREASURE VEG CHILLY. All Dishes were served spontaneously and all were almost authentic chinese dishes. There was no soup provided along with dumplings as is provided in Kolkata shops. We were disappointed with Manchurian as they were too much salty. Noodles were perfectly cooked but the babycorns needed to be boiled a bit. Overall a wonderful experience as we spent more than 2 hours eating n chitchatting with friends. We also had cakes which we brought from outside. They were very much cooperative to allow us outside food.

So, when I heard that they have opened another restaurant in Gachibowli which is near to my home, I was excited and took my family to dinner. First of all, the ambience is a huge let down. It looked like any budget restaurant and I was thinking whether I should get out or go in. Finally, went in expecting some great food.
We ordered noodles, fried rice, a lamb dish and a brownie. First of all, the prices were exorbitant for the ambience and the overall experience. They are providing a 3* experience and asking for 4*/5* prices. The fired rice was great but the lamb was undercooked. The desert was a disaster. Overall, please avoid this restaurant.

Excellent serving time, all items arrived on time infact for a change had folks asking if we want to hold a little while before getting next dish out? These things matter a lot when u r paying to eat out.

Now food - Jade chicken soup, nice spinach based creamy stuff, gud way to start the meal. Accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi, nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good. Fish cakes were good, loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome. Main course was Mix XO rice of chicken and prawn, well that was the downer. Nothing exciting abt it, maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then Nash, fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry. Desert - blue berry cheesecake, so here is where me and wifey differ, I thght it was worth it, she says the base wasn't crunchy engh. So try and rate yourself.

Last ambience - was warm n eye soothing.

Chinese Pavilion,Ramandeep,"Bad rating is mainly because of ""Chicken Bone found in Veg food"" and is not acceptable for a Vegetarian.

To satiate Cravings for chinese food we headed to Chinese Pavilion and there was also a voucher available in Little app for Luncheon tray for Rs 310 (Veg) [well do not bother for the voucher as the price for Veg Luncheon tray is Rs 275/- + taxes in the restaurant itself).

The ambiance is decent and since it was noon, not many tables occupied so it was pretty quite.

It was Thrusday special (Veg):
Hot and Sour soup: was just OK - well it had sprouts which were crunchy in your mouth: something different.
Kimchi - salad (personally i'm never fond of it)
Potato in plum sauce - this was very good and well made
Brocolli, Baby corn, Mushroom in spicy sauce - this dish lived to its name 'too spicy'; but was fine with fried rice
Veg hakka noodles - was good
Veg fried rice

Overall the food tasted good until a piece of chicken BONE came into my friend's (he is pure vegetarian) mouth while eating noodles. It was such a disappointment and complete experience was ruined.
Well Management did apologise but surely they cannot put things correct and were offering of not using coupon but we surely don't want to visit the place again. I requested to see their kitchen if they really segregate pans for Veg/Non-veg cooking which Manager declined which makes me believe they don't.

Staff and service are fine but they really need to improve the segregation of Veg and Non-veg as in Indian Culture it means a lot.
