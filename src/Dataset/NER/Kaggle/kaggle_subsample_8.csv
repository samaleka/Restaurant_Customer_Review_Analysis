Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,The Food O’Clock,"This place is highly recommended. It is working with Eat India Company under the same roof, may be kitchen as well. Basically u ca order any of the two’s menu from one table. Eat India Company has Indian food while Urban Asia has asian food like chinese, thai food, etc.

We ordered The Real Bangkok Basa, Chef/Subba’s secret recipe noodles and Sanghai Fried Rice from Urban Asia.

The Real Bangkok Basa- It tastes so good. It was steamed Fish and mixed with some green sauce. Taste was 5/5 .

Subba’s secret recipe noodles was gravy noodles with lots of veggies, mushroom, chicken. Taste 5/5

Sanghai Fried Rice was a mixed of noodles and rice in which noodles was more than the rice. Taste was 5/5

Service 4/5, little bit slow in bringing food.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Rajshekher. 92,"The staff is kind and I think that's the moto of the Restaurant. The food is delicious, and there is the option for buffet and Alacarte, so we choose buffet which every thing they served on the table, which is really a good thing for me because I went with my parent. Coming to the food special I like the most, corn cube, prawn, fish, and yes ofcourse murgh angara..the staff cares about all its customers and are polite, just amazing..

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Vamsi Krishna,"Came here on a Thursday evening for dinner only to be served the worst quality food. The service was absolutely terrible... no air conditioning in the sweltering heat ... after multiple requests we got our food ( literally begged for the food to be served)... what’s not there on the buffet menu also they don’t tell the customer... the main course was served cold... pre-scooped ice creams.. and what not

Some mango juice they served... don’t know how that was drinkable ....

Worst decision to spend our evening here .. absolutely terrible experience

Giving one star because I can’t give -5

FOOD = -100/5
Service - can’t put a negative number that high
Ambience - no air conditioning on a summer evening

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Pushkar Shah,"Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews. However, we were utterly disappointed. We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co. The waiter handed us the ""Signature"" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Thejoyoffood,"Amongst the so many options now available for dining at Gachibowli, Urban Asia is difficult to ignore both for location and food. Getting in there if you are driving can be tricky sometimes since there is too much traffic in a narrow lane. However, they have a valet in the basement and you can park there and head over to the 4th floor which actually is a mix of a few restaurants. The place offers both buffet and a-la-carte options and you could choose what you like. We ordered Pad Thai noodle and chilly Tofu. I have not had such soft and delicious todu in a long time and was happy to have given that a shot. Moreover, the portion size was fairly decent. The Pad Thai tasted slightly sweet to my wife's liking but again flavoursome and good portion. The place was quiet and you could enjoy your food in peace.

And they also goofed up on the Zomato 1+1 food offer. They later corrected it, but not before arguing.

Urban Asia Gachibowli !
I am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what I was expecting. Starters Pathetic !
The prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. Uncooked Chicken Malai kababs to kabab mei "" huddi"" (bone).
Beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

Soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. The mocktail tasted really good. Finally !!

Coming to the main course I am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! Trust me nothing special !!

The chat counter was good. U can try that. From Chole kulche to Bhel puri. 4 items.

Deserts: limited but were good.

Ice Cream: They were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand.

Food 3/5
Service 1/5

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,The Greedy Hippo,"On a Saturday casual lunch, i was simply floored by the ambiance they have set up. And I couldn't stop looking at the artifacts they have put up. Its like one could just spent hours looking at them and admiring the heritage of India.

I was in mood for chinese and went full blast.
The wonton soup superceded the manchow one.
The dragon prawns were okayish. The sangdown chicken wings could have been more jucier.

Coming on to the main course, we had ordered a barrage of items.
Sanghai fried rice: loved it
Kung pao chicken : delicious
Hunan chicken : bland, had to parcel
Shrimp soft noodles: good
Bamboo fried rice: good
Pan fried noodles in Cantonese sauce: a disaster.

For my part I had ordered food which turned out to be best, my friends were dissapointed.

The mojito and virgin mojito were good and packed a punch.

I loved everything about this restaurant and would be back here to try my favourite kung pao chicken. It has stuck on my taste buds.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Shouvik Acharyya,"This place is nothing as it is shown in the images. The ambience maybe good, but the service is too bad. The chicken salt and pepper was nothing as simple as I thought and the tai pei crispy chicken was not all crisp. And if this was not enough the add on was the main course. The name mentioned in the menu for the main course resembles more of a continental food, which creates a lot of confusion. We ordered three dishes for main course not having any about the fact that the dishes are gravies, rather than semi gravy. The worst is the suggestions from the manager, who suggested us to have a rice item along with the dishes we ordered. Knowing that the dishes comes with gravy and it would be too much for 3 people to have that much gravy, it was very disappointing to have a suggestion from them. Moreover despite of showing the Zomato gold coupon the code was not added and even after having such a bad experience and complaining about the food, they added an extra service charge to the final bill. Won't complain much about the ambience but the food menu is a bit confusing.
My suggestion would be if you already had a drink or too its better not to order without asking, and importantly don't try and take suggestion from the management.
Been to many Asian restaurants, had bad food, but never got so confused about the menu. I had Sandip Acharyya with me. Both of us are very dissapointed.

4. Showstopper - Yin Yan soup. Half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste. The other half of it had thick coriander soup.

The buffet had dumplings, sushi, which I felt were food for buffet.

We we in mood to eat proper Chinese. We ordered a pork dimsum, stir fried chicken starter.
Another chicken main course and fried rice.

Everything was good.

But then comes the bill part.

I Really don't know how they missed the Zomato 1+1 to cut from the bill.
Also they had so 91 bucks extra S. Tax apart from GST.
Which made us change the bill again.

Honestly speaking, after serving good food, missing the gold and adding extra money apart from GST decreases the moral value for the place.

Kindly try avoiding the addition of that.

I visited this restaurant for the fifth time expecting to get better food and service than last time, but it is always degrading. We came in to Lunch at around 2:45, the first thing which irritated was they were served me cold starters and I complained then they went and heated it up and served, this was corn cubes, they promised 11 started in the buffet menu and they never bothered to serve all. I had to ask him to check what the menu was and can he serve all of them and still they never served. I think they were supposed to serve soup at table along with starters which they always did before, I went and asked them about it then they said it is available at the buffet section and we can go and get it. I really felt like going to a place where they were serving free food and we had to go and ask for what we wanted. It was absolutely ridiculous experience, they started turning off the lights when we're still eating, I agree we were late but switch off all the lights and we go out in a kind of darkness?

The buffet appetizers served at the table were good and served hot. Veg appetizers were good, chicken was very average and the fish was quite good. Budget however looked tired and like food had been sitting for a while. We didn't have much appetite after the starters so that was good.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Harishankar Patel,"If you want to try something new from the daily routine taste,try dinning out once in Urban Asia and you will love everything about it.. Give your taste buds a try for the ""crispy kai in Bangkok curry"" for starter and the cheese balls are mesmerizing .. For main course you definitely try the ""bamboo fried rice"" and the Malaysian curry combo.. you will love it.... And if your love is for Noodles.. Padh Thai will take your breath away with it's coconut flavoury mouthwatering taste... The soothing music is cherry on the cake. A fine Dinning and Urban Asia is way to go...

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Sourav Datta,"A beautiful Asian restaurant with awesome food.

Food : 4.5/5 Tried some items from their special menu and some from their normal menu. The soup was awesome and the way it was presented with two clear demarcation between the two flavors made it even more special. The dumplings were really good, it was juicy at the center with a very thin crust. The dumpling dip could have been better though. The Nyonya was again very delicious and the lemon grass flavor in the curry was just out of this world. The Nasi Goreng was very smelly of dried fish and something that we did not enjoy. Have tried their buffet also earlier and liked the unconventional nature of the buffet which servers Indian and Asian together. The green curry in the buffet was again very delicious.

Ambiance : 3.5/5 This is actually two restaurant under the same roof. I am not sure why was that done and other than the buffet it really does not make any sense sense.

Service : 4/5 Service was again very good. They took the time to explain the dishes notified of the possible wait time for any dish and above all were very friendly.

Price : 3.5/5 It is priced at per some of the fine dining restaurant and as such is fair. The only thing is that in such fine dining set up you should not run a buffet and a la carte in parallel.",4,"78 Reviews , 1612 Followers",11/18/2018 23:11,3,,"{'food': ['soup', 'dumplings', 'Nyonya', 'Nasi Goreng'], 'drink': []}"

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Pavan Rishit Meka,"This restaurant space in Gachibowi is the fusion of Urban Asia and Eat India Company which are under the same roof with different names.

✓Ambience

This is very much spacious having multiple separated halls for group dining with cozy ambience. This restaurant is themed with village style vintage wooden decors all-around the place. Most of the interior walls are covered with vintage wooden doors, windows and locks.

And also there is a separate dining hall where one of the wall is completely covered with photo frames of old nizami Kings and their belongings.

✓Food

We went here for a dinner buffet. The food is really delicious and this was the first time I was liking Sea food in the starters. All the starters are really good but Kung Pao fish and Prawns parsely dry are the best of its kind.

Dinner Buffer Menu:

*Starters:

1. Murgh Haryali Tikka
2. Lahsooni Murgh Tikka
3. Kung Pao Fish
4. Prawns Parsely dry
5. Crispy Potato Corn cube
6. Sichuan Baby Corn
7. Paneer Angar Tikka
8. Corn Tikka
9. French fries

*Main Course:

1. Bindi Jai Puri
2. Yellow Dal Tadka
3. Palak Paneer
4. Murgh Lababdar
5. Mutton do Pyaza
6. Murgh Dum biryani
7. Sabzi Dum biryani
8. Garlic noodles
9. Butter Naan and Roti
10. Curd Rice
11. Khow suey

*Salads:

1. Tossed Salad
2. Crispy Noodles Salad
3. Kimchi Salad
4. Grilled chicken salad

*Desserts:

1. Pineapple Tarts
2. Chocolate Brownie
3. Pastries
4. Shahi Tukda
5. Varied flavors of ice creams.

We don't have much variety in desserts but the ice creams here are really good and served with different luscious toppings. Just looking at them will trigger the cravings in your mouth.

✓Service

The only saddest part of this restaurant is the service that they provide. Though it is a buffet, All the starters will served to the table. There is a lot much interval from one starter to the other starter that they serve.

And you will feel that half the time your plate is empty and you need to keep on waiting for them to serve. The service part of this restaurant is really irritating and this needs to be corrected with much importance.

✓Value for money

The dinner buffet here costs around Rs.650/- per person. And you will definitely feel that this place is worth your money. Be prepared to bear with the bad service and rest you will definitely enjoy.

Ordered water chestnut in honey pepper sauce. Like the dish, could have been less spicy though.
Next up was chicken dumpling. This was yummy.
Chicken Thai red curry was good and creamy, but again was a bit spicy for Thai curry.

Honestly I dont dig Indo-Chinese, but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal Indian dishes. Quick service and very polite staff, got those starters real quick and they were good, nothing over the top, just old school good stuff.
Main course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. The desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Abhishek Mandal,"Our first experience with Urban Asia was pretty average however since then every time we visited this place it has been beyond satisfactory. The first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service, long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items (the name of which I don't remember unfortunately).

The establishment houses two different restaurants (Eat Street and Urban Asia) under the same roof and without any strict boundary. You can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability. The service usually is prompt and courteous . Overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall.

Since we love Asian Cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent I would like to specially mention the Nasi Goreng. We have tried it in many restaurants in India besides having it in Bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation. Susi was also excellent, very fresh and delicious.

We had to complaint to the manager about the same, who agreed with us but did nothing anyway. So we walked out without completing the lunch.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Ankit Jain,"A must visit place for their exquisite Asian cuisine ,not just for the dishes they offer but also for the authentic taste of those dishes !

The ambience is so appropriate to aggrevate your hunger and salivate your mouth. One does start feeling the aura of fine dine - for which the crockery and cutlery is the first noticable example.

We ordered vegetable chilli sticks ,salt and pepper chicken as starters .
Vegetable chilli sticks (1st pic) is a must for all vegetarians here ,if felt really satiating having tasted one of the best Chinese dish I ever ordered (5/5)

Salt and pepper chicken was good - as told by my accompanying friend . I found the texture good ! He rates it (4/5)

For Main course we ordered chilli garlic soft noodles and button mushroom and diced babycorn in oyster sauce gravy dish .

Chilly garlic noodles were cooked with finesse with perfect combination of spices and flavour of veggies .very balanced ! A must to mention is the quantity served , it can be shared by 3 people (4.5/5)

Button mushroom ,diced babycorn in oysters sause- this dish is basically fried mushroom and babycorns tossed in oyster sauce that is medium spicy . It blended so perfectly with the spicy noodles .(4/5)

I also ordered virgin mojito which comprised of ice and only ice and they charged 160 bucks for that (2/5)

Final verdict - authentic asian food with great ambeicne .with Zomato gold it makes it really worth giving it not just one try but visit here frequently !",4,"138 Reviews , 821 Followers",8/13/2018 1:47,3,,"{'food': ['vegetable chilli sticks', 'chilli garlic soft noodles', 'button mushroom', 'diced babycorn in oyster sauce gravy dish'], 'drink': ['Virgin mojito']}"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Joyita Bhattacharya,"I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store. There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.
It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company.
We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !
One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !

We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !
They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.

Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-

1. Crabmeat Soup- This soup was thick with minced crab meat. The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.
2. Corn Cubes - A must try out platter. The dish was innovative. The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.
3. Chicken Yakitori- I did not like this preparation. It was very dull and tasteless. There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.

Main Course -

1. Manchow Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.

Dessert
1. Bangkok Custurd- I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! It tasted like Firni. As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. It was just yum for the greedy tongue.

Total- Rs. 1396 ( Inclusive of taxes )

Cobclusion - The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.

The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. No coordination among the staffs. Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.

The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !

This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions. Its just okayish for casual dinner/ lunch. I will think twice to visit this place again.",3,"20 Reviews , 54 Followers",8/12/2018 9:48,7,,"{'food': ['Crabmeat Soup', 'Corn Cubes', 'Chicken Yakitori', 'Manchow Chicken Fried Rice'], 'drink': []}"

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Soumosri Pal,"#urbanasia #panasian #delightfulexperience.

Well this place is quite an old one in jubilee hills standing strong for quite a long time now. The food here is an absolute delight. When they say PAN ASIAN , they mean PAN ASIAN . The experience of the jubilee hills branch was so amazing that I was being pulled to try their gachibowli branch. And I would love to visit this place over and again, if not for anything but the ORANGE CHICKEN.

Food( 4/5)

The food here is an absolute delight. No chance is left for any complaint. Good to mention, both the time I have tried ala carte and not the buffet.

Starting with the spare ribs to the chilli basil Chiken to the sanghai prawns, all of them were absolutely delicious. The spare ribs is a must try as the same taste quite different from the normal spare ribs, it has a Chinese tinge instead of a continental touch which is taste changer.
The aroma of the chilli basil chicken is enough to fill the heart with good vibes. Fresh, refreshing yet light on stomach this item is a perfect starter.

The sanghai praws are good, well cooked and a bit tangy to change the taste bud.

Amongst all their dishes , my all time favorite which pull me to this place over and again is the ORANGE CHICKEN , which is a must must try here. This dish is an absolute delight to the minf, soul and taste bud. This I believe is the most innovative pan Asian dish which I haven't had in a long time. I call this an innovative dish because no other pan Asian restaurant is able to provide with such a perfect dish with the right mixture of everything.

Service (4/5)

I believe a restaurant can be surely judged by it's staff.. Here the staff knows all their dishes so well that they are promptly able to suggest you with the right dishes to compliment each other. Kudos to the staff.

Ambiance ( 4/5)

As urban Asia is a chain of restaurant, we were made to sit at their Indian counterpart as it was a Saturday night and quite late . The interior is quite interesting and has a touch of the rural India in it's decor which I guess is a perfect combination for the Indian restaurant.

Went on a Sunday and there was no crowd at all. The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside. The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming. Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good, the pace of refills needed to improve.

I honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course. The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that's about it.

It's expensive factoring in the food and service you get. These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment.

Serving is damn slow, even though not much of crowd in the restaurant. Price is pretty on a higher side, virgin mojito just tasted as mint lemon drink. We need to ask several times to serve, also when we for main course figured out that few dishes were not served to us which were part of starters, when asked, the same was brought later, Welcome Drink is the one which is served after several remainders and tasted bad. Desserts were not so great and not many. Felt with the cost that was paid this is not much upto mark.

Drop in to this place with my partner for lunch,.They have zomato gold 1+1 food offer.. Ambiance is pretty authentic more like village and antique piece were drawing my attention....liked the quotes on pillars..
In starter, we ordered Kaju aur bhutte ki seekh which was too soft that break in small pieces.. Actually the consistency was not proper so could not take a bite properly.. Taste wise it was little bland so, there was only cashew taste I could feel..
In main course, we ordered Patiala Shahid paneer
Which was one of their signature dish which I was expecting to be good in taste..but again I disappointed with the taste it was normal onion tomato gravy and consistency of gravy was thin instead of creamy..Ajwain paratha and naan was good in taste

Eat India company has a sharing kitchen with urban kitchen. Interestingly, in eat India company, they also gave the urban kitchen's menu. Ambience is pretty good that has cobination of modern furniture and ancient India decorum.

When we reach there, we asked waiter to suggest their best sellers in starters and main course. Very disappointed with the kind of knowledge they have about their dishes. They were not trained enough to speak confidently about the items mentioned in the menu.

Finally, we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh in starter. The order arrived after 15 minutes. Plating looks good but tastewise, it was well below average. The stuffing was too dry, even with the chutney, it doesn't taste good.

In main course, we had patiala shahi paneer. Quantity was enough to serve two people, but again, don't expect the taste. Curry was too ordinary with lot of Curry leaves in it.

After having such a horrifying experience, they included 5% tips for their waiters. Think before you visit this place.

Corn cubes 5/5 - one of their unqiue dishes. Simply loved it. A highly recommended starters you need to try here.

Crispy Potato 4/5 - tasty and light!

Paneer lababdar 3.5/5 - taste was quite different and paneer was fresh. The tangy taste was dominating and not all may like it.

Tandoor roti 3/5 - was hard.

Lemongrass and mint ice cream 2.5/5- I expected a single serve of ice cream with a mix of these 2 flavors, but I was served with these two separately. Mint ice cream was too strong and we didn't like it, lemongrass was avg.

3. Main course was a disaster, very few choices that too of rare vegetables and less eaten. No panner the main dish, rice items weren't good. Skipped and went to the desert section.

After entering the restaurant, we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor. It had a very India taste to it. They had old locks, keys, doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look. 😍

Coming to the food, there is a plethora of options on their menu. Instead of going through it all, we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer. Hariyali Paneer Tikka and Corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination. Corn cubes cannot be missed here. My friend ordered a Chicken starter which was quite average though. Moving to main course, we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries. Paneer Lababdar, Mushroom curry and Nizami Handi seemed like good choices. Food was decent.

The service was not impeccable. It ca surely be improved. Also, they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal. Quite a surprise. 😑

The price point is a little on the higher side- probably much more than average. 😅😅 It can be a great negative. They accepted gold on food, so yay!

Eat India Company,Amul Chittalkar,"If you’re wondering what to do on Sunday then head to Eat India Company, Gachibowli. Eat India Company has been one of my favorite restaurants in Hyderabad since years. Now they’ve opened a new branch in Gachibowli. Yay to all my office folks. Everything from the ambience to the décor, to the music is wonderful. The quality and taste of the food over the years has been consistent. I love love love Indian food and they have some delicious dishes if you’re a meat lover. Everything from shorba to kebabs to nalli ki nihari to dum biryani is sooooooo yum!

On Sundays, the branch at Gachibowli teams up with Urban Asia to host a special brunch from 12 pm to 3 pm. Urban Asia is another brilliant kitchen for Asian food. If you love Chinese and Indian food, you cannot miss this brunch. They have more than 27 dishes with veg and non-veg options plus desserts. Apart from this, they also had chaat and sushi as well when I went. All this at 888 per person only. What a steal deal. My favorite five dishes from the menu are hara bara kebab, chicken angara, kang pao fish, mutton rogan josh and of course the Dal Bukhara [for those of you who don’t know, this is a velvety makhani style dal that is not spicy but packed with flavor].

Make sure to book your table in advance. Another good tip in case you’re someone who wakes up late or you forget to book a table is to go after 2pm cause it’s usually not crowded at that time.

So it’s a nice restaurant with well arranged furniture and light. Has a buffet lunch which is very convenient for Software professionals and casual lunches with friends.

I have small complaints which are listed in the end but apart from that I had a nice time.

So in the spread, something that I loved dearly was the Chilly Prawns. I just couldn’t get enough of it. It was amazing.
The chicken was alright. But I can say but prawns were the best. Although they were really small, but can’t complain much. They didn’t give us fish even after we asked for it.

Staff: attentive and service was okay.

Ambience: very nice place, looks good, clean, effort was put in to make it look nice.

Food: food was definitely good I liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts. They were pretty bad.

Complaints: Starting with the ice cream guy- they have a cold stone ice cream. He broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream (technically just mixing it) and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away. Didn’t wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop. For all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop.

Second is also with the ice cream guy, we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately. Lost our appetite soon after that.

Third is with one of the waiters, probably didn’t want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu. He agreed to get some but never showed up with it. I hope it’s his memory and nothing else that caused the problem.

Hopefully management reads this and takes action on it.

Labonel,Gopal Agarwal,"When we order something special for a loved ones birthday apart from the value there are always sentiments attached to it.

My sister aspires to start her own bakery and holds Labonel Fine Baking in high regard. Keeping this in minds we thought a Labonel cake will make her birthday more special.

We ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day. We also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake. Both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd Sept. till 6pm (this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm).

They decide to call me on the day of pickup at 4:50pm to inform me that they will shut down at 5:30pm. So, not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment's notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store.

Well since the cake held sentimental value for me I did leave immediately and rushed to the Gachibowli store. I made it there by 5:10pm and can you imagine my dismay when I saw that the store was closed! To add to it no one answered the phone.
I stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response.

I could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional. If they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments I do not think it would ever matter how their product is.

My sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products.

Since they did not contact me back even the next day I feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post. I hope this falls on deaf ears of Labonel owners.

I know I will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this, you have been warned :)

Labonel,Ketaki Agharkar,"Although, I have not been spoken rudely to by anyone working at this place, I can very well believe the negative experience many others have written about. Hochnäsig is a word that came to my mind when I visited this place the first few times. Hoch is high and näsig comes from nose. This German word can be loosely translated to snobbish or haughty, but these words do not describe my impression of them as well as “hochnäsig” does. However, that is not all they are. They are in fact one of the best bakeries in Hyderabad and one can very well understand where their pride comes from. I said one of the best and not the best for three reasons:

1.    This place is expensive.
2.    Except for the cupcakes and brownies and occasionally the chocolate cake, everything must be ordered at least a day in advance.
3.    They don’t sell cake-slices. You must buy the entire cake, which you must order in advance.

Now coming to the gooooooood stuff…

Brownies:
The best I have ever had! The chocolate is rich, deep and the brownie itself is light, moist and almost melts in your mouth. I know some of you may say that that’s not how a brownie is supposed to be, that it is supposed to be dense and gooey and you may be right. BUT, try this one for the flavor and its melt-in-your mouth quality.

Chocolate Cakes:
I have tried one of their Classic Chocolate cake and Triple Chocolate cake. All the chocolate cakes are made from the same batter as the brownies, so each one of them is rich, moist with an excellent, deep, chocolate flavor. The best one is clearly the Triple Chocolate cake.

Carrot Cake:
To me there are two kinds of carrot cakes. One is the desi kind that you get at Parsi bakeries, which is moist, dense, has khoya/mava and cardamom even. The other kind is the fancier, videsi version, which has nuts (mostly walnuts), cinnamon, a cream-cheese frosting and is drier. Labonel being a “fine baking” place naturally has the latter kind. Although I am not much of a fan of this kind because of the cinnamon, which in my mind always over-powers any dessert, Labonel’s carrot cake is the best I have ever had in this category.

Cheesecakes:
I have only had one of their cheesecakes, blueberry I think. It was a right amount of fluff, fat, sweetness and flavor. The base was delicious too. However, the cheesecakes at Eclat or Chili’s are slightly firmer, hence a bit better.

Cupcakes:
Cupcakes are their only product that I am not a fan of. They are too small, the frosting is a little too soft and in my opinion add no value to cake. You can give the cupcakes a complete miss.

Cookies:
Choco-chip, Double chocolate and white chocolate/raspberry and the only 3 kinds they bake. Soft, rich, moist, chewy and yummmmmmm…

Miscellaneous:
There are some seasonal cakes like the honey cake or the plum cake. The honey cake is ok, but the plum cake is so loaded with rum that it can make a teetotaler a little tipsy.

Overall, if you don’t mind spending a lot and are a cake fan like me, then don’t give this place a miss.",4.5,"20 Reviews , 60 Followers",11/3/2017 17:12,10,,"{'food': ['brownies', 'chocolate cakes', 'carrot cake', 'cheesecakes', 'cookies'], 'drink': []}"
Labonel,Aditi Gupta,"#BrownieLove  # BakedWithLove

Classic calm interior. I loved their theme color ""Blue"". Packaging is sober and royal, an excellent house warming present. 

Brownies were soft, chocolaty and yum yum yum. They were simply the best. 
One has to buy a complete box of 15 piece medium sized square brownie. Rs 700 for box of brownie which will last for 4-5 days, per brownie it costs ~50. Good deal for a group of 6-7 people however not so good deal for single person/loner. 
Place an order in advance for assorted box of brownie. 

Suggestion: 
I don't want to go and eat chocoLava in Dominos on cheat day, instead i want to have Brownie here.

It's just walnut kismiss cake with cinnamon flavour and maybe carrot somewhere. And of course cream cheese frosting. There were simply too many kismiss in there. I hated every bit of that cake.
I have had few other chocolate flavour cakes from here and they are an absolute delight. 3.5 rating is because carrot cake has spoiled it all.

So yesterday the occasion was right  and I was in the mood to splurge and enjoy some quality stuff with my SO. Unfortunately, I was utterly disappointed with the service that they had to offer. The staff at Labonel don't know anything about customer service.They were very rude and mean to us. I wanted to check their catalog but the person was behaving as if I was there to steal their products. Very impatient and unwilling to help. And also their phone number never works. Tried calling several times and never got a response. Anyways coming to food. I only ordered assorted collection of cupcakes The price burnt a hole in my  pocket. Only 15 tiny cupcakes for 850rs. The flavors are vanilla, chocolate and red velvet with vanilla and chocolate frosting. I tried the vanilla and chocolate so far and I  can say that chocolate cup cake is just fine, nothing special or out of the world experience like some other reviews claim it to be. Vanilla cupcake was dry and tasteless. Yes it was like eating a sponge(I am not saying that the cupcakes was as soft as a sponge it was as tasteless as a sponge). Nothing but just hype . I have had better cupcakes for a lot less money in small bakeries.

My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste.

Ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception. The moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. They mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. The price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. We were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. The brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. This was one of the best brownies I have had in a long time. We also bought the cup cakes and they were yummilicious as well. Want to try everything in the menu in future. Keep up the great work!!

Very ill professional employees who cannot guide their costumers properly to their place. They have great quality in what they serve but zero in how they serve. My whole party got ruined because of their so called great service. I have given a bulk order and asked if they have home delivery, ofcourse there was none. I was okay with it and said I will collect it from their store. I almost travelled 20 km from my place to collect my @ order and due to heavy traffic, I reached the place exactly 5 min late from their closing time. I kept giving them information about how far I am and that I would reach them in less time. I requested them to wait for 5 minutes as I was travelling from habsiguda which is atleast 20km away from banjara hills. They answered my call at 9:00 when I was near GVKONE. I said I will come in 5 min they said they will wait. But, by the time I reach their place everything was locked. I called them 100 times and their was no response. What an awful service..!

Labonel,Krati Mathur,"Updated review:
Ever since my first visit to Labonel I have already been a sucker for their brownies and now am gonna be for their cup cakes too. This cup cake box has 3 varieties of mini cupcakes: chocolate, vanilla and red velvet. All the three varieties were baked to perfection with extremely soft, airy and moist sponge with this luscious and velvety icing on top. They are definitely at the top of their game right now.
P.S. the icing was a bit sweet for our personal taste.

Previous review:
A class apart, fine baking luxurious bakery in the midst of all the hustle bustle. Labonel holds a very different, sophisticated yet very pleasant aura. All this while I avoided this sweet gem coz I assumed it's hell expensive (considering cost for two stated as 3000) but that's certainly not the case.
Because I was in a hurry and dint have time to try, test and enquire about all the items, I quickly picked up a box of chocolate brownies. Heavenly, decadent, sinful, melt in the mouth, luxurious, delectable, delightful....I can go on and on raving about this piece of art. I do like to clear the air about misconception of Labonel being shockingly expensive coz it is not. A box of 15 brownies with utmost quality for 650 and 15 cupcakes that too with three different flavours for 800 is more than a fair deal, coz once in a while your sweet tooth needs extra pampering ;P

It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit, talk, sip coffee, enjoy the background songs, not a noisy cafe like some other cafes. This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.

But the negative point is that they don’t have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star.

Driven Cafe,Farhad Tarapore,"The first thing that strikes you about the place is the ambience. You have a triumph thunderbird LT on one side with it's massive round headlights and a ducati monster on the other side in a dashing red. There's great music playing and there's riding gear, etc. hanging off the walls with numbers to call in case you want to rent some of it. 
I went in early morning around 8:30. The cleaning lady was still sweeping and it was kinda hot inside (ac switched off probably). There was no one behind the counter. Asked the cleaning lady and she shouted out for someone who came right away and took my order. 

Ordered for a mint mocha and a cinnamon roll. The guy was coughing randomly (hopefully not into my food or drink), but I found this to be an annoyance. I mean, you can have the fanciest of ambience but if the people who serve there aren't trained in basic hygiene and cleanliness, it all goes to waste. 

The mint mocha was superb and the cinnamon roll was ok-ish. As I paid, I got a torn note, so I gave it back (to exchange it of course). Instead the guy just took it and went away. I waited for a while, then called out. Asked for my money and instead of one note, he handed over two. The dude was clearly in his sleep - probably having been through the night shift.

Giving the rating only for ambience and quality of food. 1 point taken away for the serving attendant.

Coming to the food, they don’t have much variety, it’s just pizza, pasta, sandwich and desserts. We had ordered veg pizza- loved it, loaded with cheese and veggies with super thin crust. Four cheese pizza- I didn’t like it that much, made up of four types of cheese with super thin crust. Veg sandwich- nailed it, it was the most yummiest one for me. Paneer sandwich- my friends loved it, I don’t eat paneer so I can’t say that for myself. White sauce pasta- it was good, more veggies to it would have made it perfect for me.
Coming to drinks, I ordered cool blue slush and I loved it taste wise , another reason being, it took too long to sipped up fully.

▪Chocolate bomb - tasted like crushed oreos with butter and meagre amount of chocolate.

▪coffee crunch - it was good because I like chocolate and coffee combo. But for the price, the drink itself not that rich.
Few good points:
▪vegetarian cafe
▪good location
▪good music
▪they buzz you when your food's ready

All I can say is (and I am saying this because I believe that everything can get better if you put effort) Driven Cafe... dont drive us away with your bad food. We dont mind paying a bomb if the food is excellent. And your selling point is NOT the Ambience. You dont have a selling point if your quality of food is so low.

The ambience stands out from all the nearby places, with whole garage theme. If you look closely the tables on first floor are actually made up on car and truck parts as well! Too much innovation and thinking, is just mind blowing. The wall next to stairs full of pictures is most photogenic. The cherry on top is their songs selection.

All the coffees taste great, especially the fact you get it even after midnight. Although my personal favourites are Flat white and Cappuccino. The quite bites available as Paneer Kulcha is recommended as well.

Driven Cafe,ChicLifeByte,"If bikes, cars and coffee are your weaknesses then the Driven Cafe is no less than heaven for you. Their luxurious collection of supercars and bikes includes fantabulous FORD-MUSTANG-5, premium PORSCHE-911 CARRERA-4S0, the Hulk of Bikes TRIUMPH-ROCKET-III, speedy SUZUKI-HAYABUSA and the kinetic KAWASAKI-ZX14R- which is also one of the world’s fastest bike to name a few and guess what one could also rent these amazing creations from their website. At present, their fleet consists of 150 cars, 50 motorcycles and 7 bicycles.

If this doesn’t satisfy the gearhead inside you then there’s some delicious food and coffee for killing your hunger cravings even in those odd hours of the night!

The place is a brilliant amalgamation of a cafe and a bike museum. The ground floor of this establishment is a quaint cafe which sells food and beverages. It is very vintage in feel and decor and you will be treated by a very well spoken staff. The cafe also has a store which sells/rents biking accessories including biking jackets, helmets and other accessories.

Coming to the food now, the first thing we had here was the Chili Cheese Toast which is a cheddar melt on white bloomer with an orange mayo. It was quite filling and really tasty. Next up was the flavourful Apple Pie with ice-cream that totally melted in mouth and tasted heavenly with ice-cream.

This was complemented with a selfie coffee and a regular coffee. The ‘selfie coffee’ has your selfie printed on the coffee foam purely made of edible ink. This is one-of-a-kind experience. You click a selfie and Whatsapp that on a number, they’ll print that particular selfie on the coffee.

Lastly we had the Turkish Baklava Twins which were crunchy, nutty, flaky and really delicious. The place has a lot of variety in terms of coffee which included Colombian Coffee, Death Wish, Illy Monka, Birch Coffee, Araku Tribal Coffee, Organic Decaf Peppermint Mocha and many more.

The place is definitely a must go!

I ordered Reshmi Chicken Kebab Wrap, Cheese Melt Chicken Wrap & Chicken Rice Feast

What was good?

Neatly packed.
They have used reusable container for the rice and recyclable carton box(small) for the wraps
Attractive packaging.

Above all, the Taste. The products tasted real good.

I feel the cheese 🧀 on my mouth when I was having the cheese melt wrap. Chicken was tender and cooked real soft. They are boneless and hence facilitated smooth process of eating them. Wrap was cooked equally good.

Reshmi Chicken Kebab Wrap was awesome. It gave a different taste altogether.

Highlight was the rice though the wraps were equally good. Rice was cooked with real long basmati rice and the masala mix was at the right proportion. It can be had by both - children and elders. They have two differential cooked chicken on the top. Both are boneless and cooked with perfection. Only the ingredients differ.

All of them are amazing but Pizza wrap is just mind blowing.They have multiple options for the bread of the wrap as well - multigrain, crispy bake,lacha Parantha etc.

Pizza wrap has cheese, vegetables and other sauces in it. It gives you a feel of both wrap and pizza and tastes amazing.The size is big and is good enough as a meal for one person

I have also tried chola kulcha and Veg thali from Faasos but in Bangalore,they were also very good.

Pizza Wrap (5/5)
Mac n Cheese wrap (4.5/5)
Cheesy corn Salsa(4/5)
Aloo wrap (3.5/5)
Jumbo Veg wrap(3/5)
Egg wrap (3.5/5)

Faasos,Shashank Vyas,"Zomato has asked me to be polite.. ok.. Faasos is delightfully bad in its food quality... When you order a pizza roll.. they not only bake it like a pizza but they take it to the next level of master culinary skills... They roast it till the end.. just like how your mumma used to make it.. and best part comes next.. Faasos excels in giving surprises and since they handle their own delivery you can never know when your food is going to arrive... It's too much fun to see that status - ""Food is being prepared"" , ""Your food is in the kitchen"".. and they won't update it because the delivery person can come any moment to your doorstep and say Surprise.. In my case they were quick enough to deliver it in only 1 hour 30 minutes... So fast da.. then I remembered food should have been delivered only in 40 minutes... I asked delivery person why so much late da.. He said sir we were cooking your roll property that's why it took time.. open it and try it sir.. you would have never seen such roll.. And he was right.. I never saw the roll only charcoal.. ( attached picture for reference )",1,"2 Reviews , 21 Followers",11/2/2018 2:13,1,,"{'food': ['pizza roll', 'charcoal'], 'drink': []}"

Faasos,Hungry Soul,"Navratri review program~

I ordered sabudana meal and it was super awesome to get the special thali delivered in the navratri season with all the ingredients as needed for the fast. The packaging was good and the order was delivered on time. The thali has sabudana khichdi with loads of potato and peanuts ,curd, sabudana kheer, paneer makhni and a pumpkin chatpata chutney kind of curry. Everything tasted good just that the makhni didn't go with the meal. There could be rotis as well and the portion of khichdi cud be decreased. The taste was no doubt best. Fasoos has been doing great in terms of bringing the festivities and food together. It was a little expensive though but it's worth it.😀 Unique menus are always welcome.

I am unable to attach all the pics though coz i already reviewed the delivery once which somehow got deleted. Deserves a 4.5 😀

Parathas were excessively oily. Paneer and tomato curries tasted awful. Everything tastes candy sweet. I couldn't eat any of it apart from a bite to just taste.

The meal was a complete let down.

Got a chance to review their Navratri special menu and chose their royal navratri meal which came in a neat packaging with Singhada ke aloo parantha,paneer makhanwala,sabudhana ki kheer,green tomato curry and curd. Best part was paneer makhanwala , it was perfect and exactly with no onions and garlic suitable for Navratri and then the rare and filling part was paratha 🎉 The meal is completely fills your stomach after a whole day of fasting! I rated it 4 because of spilling of oil and tomato which is a bit half cooked else everything was perfectly enroute deli ♥️

Cheesy melt paneer wrap was outstanding...Cheese was busting in mouth with each bite..paneer and gravy was really tasty..It has Punjabi flavor with cheese combination..Loved it..

Paneer wrap - It was average in taste as the gravy was little bland and plus it has cheakpea curry which annoyed me a lot.. taste was not good..

I got a cheese paneer roll and a paneer tikka masala roll to review.
If you've to order one among the two go for the paneer tikka masala roll. It had right amount of spices. The cheese paneer roll was too bland. It had just a lot of cheese and paneer but no spices to make it tasty.

The quantity was good enough for one. Would have loved it even more if they would have made cheese and masala as a combination.

Jumbo Veg Wrap - 4.5/5 was quite delectable, it included paneer, onion, potatoes mashed masala, mayonnaise.
Cheese melt paneer wrap - 3/5 had too much of cheese, although sprinkled with the spicy masala it tasted fine, but in comparison to the one above I expected something of equivalent taste to my tongue.

Royal Spicy Restaurant,Devendar Elamarti,"Since my childhood, I've always been a fan of gongura with non veg and when I got to know that this place serves a good Gongura Biryani, thought of having it.

And then comes a day when I finally ordered it and guess what, as soon as you see it, you'll fall in love with the colour of biryani 😍 Hopefully that is not an artificial colour. But coming to taste, it's awesome. Just lyk God is omnipotent, the flavour of Gongura is omnipresent😉 I mean in every rice grain you can sense it. The chicken pieces too were very good. They are soft too as one my friends who has a fence to her teeth😜 could eat those easily 😂
Tagged at a moderate price , quantity is quite sufficient.

If you're a lover of Gongura , then this a must try.

NOTE: I don't have any idea about ambience . My rating confined to Gongura biryani alone as I haven't had anything else from there.

P.S. I still have this doubt how the chef managed to get that color to the biryani 🤔🤔🤔",4,"10 Reviews , 8 Followers",12/16/2018 1:50,0,,

The order was taken over call and rest of the communication like what message is to be written on cake etc was done on whatsapp. When I called the next day to collect the cake, they could not find my order. I had to call multiple times and finally I was told my order is ready. Upon reaching the outlet, the message was not written on the cake and they hurriedly packed a cake and gave me. When I asked them if this is really mocha walnut, they said yes you can see the walnut on the cake. They even had no idea of how much payment is remaining or how much I have already paid. Upon reaching home when the cake was cut, we realised it is not mocha walnut but butterscotch!! The outlet cheated me and so I called them and blasted over phone. I reached the outlet at 10:30 pm at night and slammed the cake in the store and demanded my money back, I was paid back the amount but the experience was terrible and bitter specially because it was a b'day cake. The store management is pathetic and there is no coordination or even an ounce of professionalism in them. Never ever going back and I strictly recommend anyone to go at their own risk.

The place is very chilled out, there was no one at our table to check what we wanted to order despite the place being almost empty.

My husband placed the order for us,a mushroom omelette for me and a roasted mushroom makhani sandwich for him. I'm usually not a coffee person but the weather demanded a hot beverage and filter coffee was the first thing that came to my mind. We ordered 2 filter coffees and 1 bagel with cream cheese. The bagel was amazing with the coffee. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese but my husband is and he loved it. We made a pact to go for breakfast every Saturday mornings after this because I realised what an important meal I was missing due to my laziness :)

Coming to the worst part - the service. In all my visits over the past couple of months, this has been the biggest turn off about this place.

My First impression about this place was that it had a nice decor and relaxed seating areas, both indoor and outdoor. We went there around 1 p.m. and it was very hot, so we opted for sitting indoor.

We tried many cakes, cookies and doughnuts here and I liked most of them but my favorite are:

a) Red Velvet Doughnut [Rs.60] which was freshly baked and was stuffed with gooey cream filling.

b) Salted Nutella Doughnut [Rs.75] which was very soft and stuffed with Nutella.

c) Banana Cake [Rs.155] which was moist, soft and cake like sweet bread.

d) Dark Chocolate Cookie [Rs.50] which was once again very soft but was not too sweet.

Squeeze @ The Lime,Satya Teja,"I was searching for a good Veg place around Gachibowli to host my daughters 1st Bday and ended up with Lime. Dinesh was the manager and he made sure the menu and other arrangements are all taken care off. Over all i was happy with the way it went except for few points to caution. 

My personal fav foods - 
- Welcome drink - Pan shots
- Starters - Yum banana tikki
- Gravys - Malai kofta
- Noodles
- Mango dal
- Chats and Chocolate gulabjamun
What is good :
- Food is great in contrast to what we generally see in party places where the hall is free
- Staff is friendly
- Their roof top gives a different experience than a regular AC hall

Things to keep in mind :
- The Mic system caused issues which spoiled the party mood. They have good mic system, please make sure its in working condition and there is AV operator in stand by through out the party
- This place is strictly for a small group. Statis crowd should not exceed 60 - 65 pax. You can enjoy the place to fullest with 50-60 pax.
- Since it is roof top, summers can be pain ful even with coolers. There is always this tension of rain ;P

With the above exceptions, i loved the place. Their suite rooms are one of the best in the area at a reasonable price. Their ala carte menu also serves the best veg food in this part of the city.",4,"1 Review , 56 Followers",4/11/2019 21:22,0,,"{'food': ['Yum banana tikki', 'Malai kofta', 'Noodles', 'Mango dal', 'Chats and Chocolate gulabjamun'], 'drink': ['Pan shots']}"

We ordered the cake too from them as i wanted a normal cake.
The birthday party was a huge hit with guests raving about the food. The starters were yummiest amongst all. Baby corn chilli garlic is the best. Bajjis were very hot and good. The highlight of the day was SIGNATURE drink from the lime. It was lemonade kind. Guests were
enjoying it alot.
We wanted no onion no garlic items in t
the menu. Dal was very tasty without onions and garlic. Elders were surprised to see that in a restaurant they could get it.
One of my relatives commented that he ate such great spread after 10 years in a restaurant.

We have chosen Squeeze @ The Lime for our Kid's B'Day party as we found it very good when we attended few parties at roof top banquet.

I visited this place for about 6 times with family, friends & colleagues (reunions).  Every time I happened to have a variety to taste....especially the SOUP and the platter is colourful.....the STARTERS. In fact to be precise.....like the ""Death by Chocolate"" in icecreams, their specialty is ""Death by Starters"".....they are just enough for your craving muscles & blends of buds. 

The hospitality is a near very good and courtesy is the topping on the ice.  My 3 cheers and 5 thumbs for this place.

Squeeze @ The Lime,Kshitindra Jain,"Simply the best place in town for hosting a party specially if you are looking for a pure vegetarian authentic north Indian food. I hosted a lunch party for about 40 adults and 15 kids today and what a memorable experience we had!! It was an important personal occasion for me and I wanted it to be a memory for lifetime and Lime staff (specially the manager, Dinesh) made sure that it happens just that way!. Food was excellent. Starters were plenty and each one of them was outclassing the other one in taste. My guest just kept asking for more and more and Lime staff kept serving them without any fuss!. I just loved their Ajwaini Paneer tikka, corn Manchurian and cottage cheese pizza. Pain puri and dahi puri were good too. And yes, the delicious manchow soup that we opted instead of tomato soup they offered by default. Main course was also matching with the high expectations that starters set. All curries were great in taste, rotis and naan were served hot and whenever one wants. Rice item were also good (didn't try one myself but as told by my guests). They served Jalebi with rabadi and chocolate gulabjamoon as desserts and everyone just loved them.

Would also like to specially mention the courtesy and hospitality shown by each and every member of their serving staff. They were actually requesting my guests to taste everything and were treating my guests and their own! What more I could have asked for. At the end special thanks to Lime manager Dinesh who made sure that we have the experience that we had.

Pata soup was no better too.. In main course we ordered Tikka biryani and veg biryani.. And they dint have mirchi ka salan in this.. Tikka biryani was sweet on taste.. It actually tasted like drumstick curry to me.. Such weird analogy but true.. Raita was the only thing I liked of all..

Khaan Saab,Tamal Sarkar,"It was a Thursday night that we decide to go to this Khaan Saab - and get the feeling of being a Royal Guest!

The ambience inside and the interiors were definitely apt to their punch line - it gives you the Royal Feeling

We ordered main course only as we were way too hungry !

Butter Naan
Punjabi Kulcha
Chicken Kurchan
Chicken Khandar

First of all I felt the pricing was a bit expensive but for the ambience and the royalty of the place I would buy it if the food is also that good!

The Butter Naan had loads of Butter to our delight and were very soft and worth it!
The Kulcha had potato filling but we expected it to be a bit more surprising given it was Punjabi Kulcha
Both the side dish had shredded chicken in gravy.
We were 7 people so while ordering when we ordered only two sides the waiter told us that one side dish suffices for only 2 or at max 3 people.
Given the price 380 we were amazed to hear this.
However we ordered only 2 and when the food arrived we understood why the waiter said so in the first place.

So we ordered one side dish later on and enjoyed the food. The taste and the quality was really excellent for all the money.

However there was another thing which stopped me from giving a 5 star rating to the place.
We asked for the bill and everything in it was justified except the charge for water

We had ordered regular water so theu gave 3 500ml Aquafina bottles and later on they gave a 1 litre bottle.

And they charged 150 for that in the bill, quite ironical when the MRP is 10 for these bottles
They charge GST and they charge water at such a idiotic price.

We clicked many pictures near the giant Elephant near the entrance. The whole place was very well decorated and I could easily spend one hour just clicking pictures.",4,"16 Reviews , 60 Followers",11/2/2018 11:20,6,,"{'food': ['Butter Naan', 'Punjabi Kulcha', 'Chicken Kurchan', 'Chicken Khandar'], 'drink': []}"

There was no difference in terms of taste and appearance for Veg Dum Biryani & Veg Pulao.  Both of these dishes were same I don't know how the restaurant makes that difference - still wondering.

In terms of the service, I ordered the food from Zomato at 8.00PM and the time of delivery was shown as 8.55PM.  I ordered it keeping in mind my meeting timing, however the restaurant was able to provide food to the delivery guy only at 9.30 which is like 35 mins late from the slated time.

I would still want to rate the food a 4 even after my bad exp with Biryani & Pualo.

The curry and roti was okay and the biryani they served was tasty. Overall the food was not bad with very reasonable rate.

It feels it will breakdown, except that it doesn't. They tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one. Coming to the food. Its just okay. Nothing outstanding or too bad. Starters and Chicken items are usually good enough. Their tandoori chicken doesn't have breast portion. I couldn't understand the rationale behind it, its just leg, thigh and wings. And yes I don't know why they have downgraded their crockery.

Olive Garden,Dinesh Rajagiri,"We've been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since I am a big fan of starters.
So as soon as we reached the spot, we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the Gachibowli area. The interior was also tiny and seemed confined.
Anyhow we ordered chicken garlic, chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant. The staff were ok, not quick but not rash though. Even though they got our food very late, they somehow tried to convince us with something non-relatable situations.
Forgetting all that, we just wanted to concentrate on our food. As soon as we had our first bite, the first thing that came to our mind was - it's good but not great. The flavour in the Biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices.
Overall, it's a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay/work near Gachibowli. This is not a place to visit from a long distance.

Olive Garden,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),"New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.

Veg white sauce pasta and chettinad chicken biryani for mains.. There was a lotttt of cheese in pasta.. Taste was on another level.. Biryani was spicy.. A little disappointed that the spice level dominated the flavor.. But rest of the items compensated for this..
