Gal Punjab Di,Mitali Agrawal,"Food is good in taste. Specially the rotis are very soft and crispy. Kadhai paneer was okay, as it was not really a Kadhai paneer basically a paneer curry.

Must try: Kadai Paneer, Garlic Naan, Shikari Murgh, Dum Ke Aloo, and Chicken Nachos.

Gal Punjab Di,Nikunj Keshav,"I went to this place for a lunch with my friend. We were the first one to land at the restaurant - sharp @12noon. Yeah! We were actually hungry. I liked the place - decoration was awesome! Cool interior. We ordered Veg Machaow Soup, Masala Papad, butter naan, Paneer Massallam and masala cold drinks. Please do note they give only Masala cold drink and not a regular cold col drink. We liked the food, taste was good. But the cold drink was tasteless - I guess it was already opened one so couldn't get the taste bar that everything was good. Ambiance was actually the best - decoration, the and ample space. But service could have been good and fast.

It comes with a drink(3/5) and dal makhani(3/5). Now I am not a regular paratha eater but occasionally i love my aloo, gobi and mooli ke parathe. I have always ordered and found them to be good but this time i was disappointed. From the looks of the paratha, i am sorry to say this, but it didn't look very punjabi.

Gal Punjab Di,Yash Sheth,"I visited this place with my friend. It is there right in the heart of Gachibowli's Indiranagar, vinayak nagar.

Upon entering, you will definitely feel good and like a family restaurant, which it is. The ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off. There are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight.

Then comes the interaction with the staff. They are quite friendly and hard working too. They do have a quick serving time but thing is their attire was not up to the mark.

Menu had a wide variety of items and at some decent rates. I really liked the way they split between veg and non-veg food.

We ordered quite a lot of stuff but I really liked the dahi kebab. It was good. But with such good starter I had pinned my hopes on Patiala lassi. But that was an anti climax of sorts. They used essence for the lassi. I hope they start making more authentic lassi with a malai on top. That will surely be a game changer.

we opted for 599 unlimited menu. Gosh it has like so many items that you will get confused what to order. Main course was great, the butter chicken and mutton were cooked properly and tasted really amazing. However, the chicken starters were lil salty.

Gal Punjab Di,Leher Sadhnani,"”Nai, They don’t have any punjabi Gal’

First things first, really not happy with their service. Two different groups of people who came after us were served earlier than us and another worst thing was Washrooms din have water supply and that created a big problem for most of the customers.

So finally we got our order after 20-25 min of wait. The lemon coriander soup was quite normal with dense eggy smell. In starters Amrutsari murg was nice with moderate flavours along with malai. This came with grated cheese on top of it which was the only best part. Methi roti was fresh and good which came with 2 pieces. Unlike plain tandoori tasted too bad, it was the flour which got stale over the time may be. Don’t know how they served it. So we ordered Boneless Murg, i guess it was Murg Musalam, this tastes really good just like as i needed less spicy, thick gravy and nice pieces of chicken.

Gal Punjab Di,Praveen Mokkapati,"Food tastes great for a quaint little place snuck in inner lanes of Gachibowli! The place is lively with Punjabi music and the friendly staff.

As vegans that eat food with little oil and spice, three of us had a sumptuous meal that comprised of Tandoori Aloo and Kebab as starters. The initial order of a different kebab was sent back as the chef didn't comply with our little/no spice request. Our order of Aloo Parantha and Veg Kolhapuri came as requested, however the Ajwain Laccha Parantha and Roti came laced with butter/ghee. The bread was replaced in 5 min or so as requested. Aloo Parantha Combo came along with raita and chole. We requested raita to be replaced with another serving of chole, and the staff gladly obliged.

Barring the few delays due to non-compliance of our requests, we found the food to be delightful, tasty and filling for a weekday dinner. The shikanji was great too! The staff are courteous, but definitely could do well with internal communication with the chef(s) to ensure requests are fulfilled.

Nizami handi was very rich, heavy but very tasty. It could have more balanced mix of vegetables and cream gravy. dont go by the photo, taste was good.

Mushroom manchurian is something i have never had before, tasted like manchurian. Personally still prefer good ol manchurian. Can definitively try if you have not eaten before..bit meaty in taste!

Gal Punjab Di,Va Hini,Been to this place a couple of times and enjoyed decent food. But my last visit to this place disappointed me a bit. Tried in starters sheela ka shashlik fish in starters. Little more marination could have enhanced the flavour of dish. Butter chicken which was ordered more didn't meet the taste buds. The chicken seems to be not that fresh and tasted more like paneer.

Gal Punjab Di,Anupam Agarwal,"When you love food and especially north Indian food you crave for the perfect butter chicken that you would probably get up north.

I guess I finally seemed to have found it in Hyderabad.

Having been to the best Indian food joints like Grand Trunk, Norfest I guess the Butter Chicken here ranks at the top... Each one of them are good in their own regard though..

I landed up at this place basis my online food orders not through Zomato but through swiggy ( somehow that's an irony given that both deliver the same distance Zomato doesn't deliver from here to my place)

So probably I will not comment on Ambience and Service.. will update that later once I visit the place but food is something that's outstanding

In the last 20 days I would have ordered 3-4 times that's a lot for me given that I don't get fixated to a place as I m more of a food explorer 🙂.

The food has not disappointed me so far. Items tried so far
Punjabi Butter Chicken - Must Recommend , the best you will find in town
Veg Angara - good
Bhatti kaMurg - must try
Tandoori Momo - can be avoided
Dahi ke kebab - brilliant for vegetarians
Murg Malai Kebab - good
Murg Tikka Masala - must recommend, the best part is that both the gravy's ( of this and butter chicken) are completely different which is hard to find. A person who loves chicken will understand my sentiments
Dal Makhani - must try

Have ordered more than a couple of times from the place and was never disappointed.

Their Dal Makhni is to die for. Great in taste.

I've also tried their Mix parottas and they couldn't have done it any better.

They also have Shikanjis. Do try them.

They charge you for containers and the packing won't disappoint you.

Gal Punjab Di,Kanika Garg,"If you are looking for north Indian food
in Hyderabad then DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE. The waiters will not listen if food is late, Manager is totally uncivilized (Tries to peek into customers wallet and also talks rudely).  

We ordered :

1) Daal Makhani (Not even average)

2) Paneer (SERVERD WITH HAIR IN IT)

3) Biriyani (Below average)

4) Tandoori roti

5) Sweet lassi

After finishing the food, they will serve you finger bowl with food particles already present in it..!!

Food : we had ordered Sava futiya Seekh kabab, Lassuni Chicken tikka & Bhatti da Murgh for starters... Since I had my kids along, had to keep in mind the spice levels. The tikkas were juicy & succulent & extremely delicious.
Stuffing ourselves with the starters, we settled for Dal Makhani with Missi Roti & lachcha parathas, for we couldn't eat in more.

The MENU CARD in itself is very quirky, it actually sparks up a thought of actually tasting those times....

* sava futiya seekh KABAB
*gat gat galaouti

Hitech Bawarchi Food Zone,Srikanth Kuramana,I ordered a chicken biryani at a cost 120rs which is an affordable price to have food for one person. But in this restaurant immediately when the order came I am really frustrated to see the quantity and quality. First talking about quantity it doesn't satisfy the hunger of atleast one person and then talking about quality it was not served hot . Readily packed food and looks like as it was not cooked fresh may be cooked atleast a day before I guess. I suggest my friends and colleagues never select this restaurant and I'll never order from this restaurant. I am even wondered how come this restaurant get 2.6 rating which is too high.

This restaurant is a classic example of how it started on a grand note and ended up being just another restaurant with hygiene issues.

To cut the long chase short, I had purchased 2 items. 1 paneer tikka biryani and Bhimwaram pulav (take aways)

In spite of telling them, both items were very spicy. My wife and I were struggling with the food. Now to top it, I found a flying insect (not a cockroach but something else with wings) that got cooked with the paneer tikka biryani.

I ordered Chicken Malai kebab and Chicken Hara Mirchi kebab. Both the kebabs were juicy and succulent with individual distinct flavors in each of them. I really like it when one kebab doesnt taste like the other and each has its own unique flavor. While the homeminister like the less spicy and creamy flavor of the chicken malai kebab, I preferred the tangyness of the hara mirchi kebab.

Although a bit on the pricier side, given the flavors and the taste, I am definitely waiting for a chance to order their biryani because if the kebabs are to go by anything, the biryani would definitely be flavorsome.

It is located near biodiversity , beside care hospital gachibowli. This place is easily accessible, as it on main road. Its in ground floor of the building. Particular i wanted to this place, to taste some Biryani's, i have been here for dinner with group of friends.
Soon i went in, i was greeted by the friendly staff, and incredible aroma of biryani's from other diner's . We managed to snag our table.

Being settled down, we ordered few Mocktails
Mango lassi, as this is season of mango's❤️ , ginger lemon, ginger cola, lemon soda, sparkling blue. Each of the Mocktails looked picturesque.

Mango lassi and lemon soda were best out of all. Rest other Mocktails were good.

To start with dinner, we had soups👇🏻
Lemon coriander : this is a clear soup, along with some broccoli, carrot. Veggies gave us a delicious taste and it's a healthy soup to start with.
Chicken machow soup: fried noodles were added on top od chicken soup.

Appetizers:
We have order crispy veg, corn 65, apolo fish, tender chicken, bangla kodi, chilli prawns

Crispy veg: all vegetable (onions, potato, carrot) were deep fried.
It tasted average.
It can be better.

Corn 65: corn kernels were mixed with floor , and some ingredients, corn kernels are made in to balls and than deep fried, served with mayo.

Tender chicken, prawns are must try here.

Main course : avakya chicken biryani, afghani Biryani's , veg noodles

Veg noodles: vegetable in it makes the noodle to give crunchy texture, sauces gives us a distinctive flavour. Noodles were soft, somehow i liked the noodles here.
Afghani chicken biryani: it is one exclusive Biryani here, on top of biryani' they serve omlet.

We have ordered some Indian bread, with tomato Cashew, and chicken curry.
Tomato curry with Cashew was best one i had , so in Hyderabad.

One cannot end dinner without desserts:
We have ordered junnu, jamun, kurbani ka meeta. I liked the jamun here, it was soft and tasted yummy.
I had a bad experience with junnu , everyone has a off night now and again, may b on that day junnu was bad.",4,"36 Reviews , 87 Followers",3/9/2019 12:23,9,,"{'food': ['Biryani', 'Chicken Machow Soup', 'Crispy Veg', 'Corn 65', 'Tender Chicken', 'Prawns'], 'drink': ['Mango Lassi', 'Lemon Soda', 'Sparkling Blue']}"
Biryanis And More,Tummyful_hyd,"Just the name of Biryani and Hyderabadis get hunger pangs! And so did we when we heard about Biryanis and more at Gachibowli for a food tasting session! Biryanis and more is a popular name in the food industry with its branches in USA as well, they are trying to spread the love for biryani across the globe with their lipsmacking varieties of biryani! And after a a few outlets in Hyderabad the newest was opened in Gachibowli opposite to Nissan Showroom or opposite to Biodiversity complex! The place is very easy to locate! Though a small outlet but yet incredible! Simple interiors with the place efficiently used for the seating! The staff was really friendly and attentive and a special mention to a staff member Sudhir who took good care of us right from the moment we entered to the time we left! ✌🏻 We being completely unaware of the menu thought that this place would be just about Biryanis...but to Our surprise this place serves variety of other dishes which are really appetizing! We started off with the shakes, we were served the Mango Lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemon, Sparkling blue and Virgin Mojito! And all of them were soo refreshing specially the sparkling blue and the ginger cola! 👌🏻 Next we had the soups, we were served the lemon coriander soup and the chicken manchow soup! They were good! And next came the starters and we had the Apollo fish, Chilli prawns, Tender chicken, Bangla Kodi, Corn 65, and Crispy veg! The best and the must have dish among them was the TENDER CHICKEN! The chicken pieces were really fleshy and juicy which were well marinated and fried with breadcrumbs! It was both Tender and crispy at the same time! Really enjoyed this dish! And the Bangla Kodi, a dish which was very new to us! It was something very unique tasty and spicy! It is made with baked potatoes with chicken filling and then it is deeply fried! You definitely should try this if you haven't! Crispy veg made with the flour batter mixed with different veggies like onion carrots etc tasted yumm! And corn 65 was amazing! Soo delectable and tasty and a completely different kind of experience for a person who have always had chicken 65! 😂The sea food was a little here and there.. Prawns were a little salty and the fish wasn't cooked really well...soo there's a room for improvement when it comes to the sea food! But they have covered it all up with their DELICIOUS BIRYANIS!😍 A complete delight to your eyes and to your taste buds as well! We had the Ulavacharu Chicken Biryani, Chicken Avakai Biryani and Chicken Afghani Biryani! Totally totally worth the money and just the Best ❤ Ulavacharu biryani made of the spices from Horse gram has that khatta meetha taste in it making it soo soo damn awesome! It is said that Ulavacharu gives heat to your body soo don't forget to have some curd, yoghurt or the raita to make it even! And then there was this Chicken Avakai Biryani, yet another mindblowing taste! Avakai means Mango..and this Biryani is made from the spices of Mango...it had the taste of the mango pickle! Never had we imagined that we'd ever be eating chicken biryani with the taste of Mango pickle! 😍😍 Then came the Afghani biryani...it's just the opposite of Ulavacharu and Avakai when it comes to the spicy level! Really flavourful and palatable biryani served with an omelette on top! Believe us if you're a Biryani lover then this place should be definitely be in Your list! I'm gonna go back again for the Biryani! ❤ the other main course included Naan basket with Chicken tikka masala and Chicken chettinadu! As you must be knowing Chicken Chettinadu a popular dish from Tamil Nadu is a very spicy dish and yet very tasty! And here at biryanis and more they have kept up with that level of spicy-ness and also the Taste! Soo the main course here is the real stunner! Next we had the desserts...ever wished to be Ganesh Gaitonde? 😂 You definitely do not want that life! But yes You can enjoy the same dessert which he just LOVES! The Kharvas also called as Junnu is an Indian milk pudding and it is made from the colostrum of the cow! We don't know how the actual taste of the Junnu is as we never had it before but yes here at biryanis and more the taste was Superb! 😍 You ought to have this dessert to get that Gaitonde feels! Next in line were the Gulab Jamun and Qubani ka meetha, the presentation of the desserts isn't really appealing soo the hotel management should definitely look after that and make some changes but the taste was good! 👍🏻
Soo if You love to enjoy a variety in Biryani then Biryanis and more should be Your next stop! 😍 You're going to love it",4,"18 Reviews , 271 Followers",3/8/2019 2:04,9,,"{'food': ['Chicken tikka masala', 'Chicken chettinadu'], 'drink': ['Mango Lassi', 'Ginger cola', 'Ginger lemon', 'Sparkling blue', 'Virgin Mojito']}"

The lovely place is properly situated at the prominent cross roads of Biodiversity, Gachibowli, right opposite to Nissan showroom. The place and its ambiance is quite cozy as the lighting is subtle and ambient which blends in pretty well with the interiors of the restaurant. The staff is exceptionally attentive and a special shout out to Mr. Sudhir for completely taking care us and treating us with an excellent dinner.

As soon as we sat down, we were greeted enthusiastically with mocktails. A group of six food enthusiasts promptly ordered six diverse mocktails namely Sparking blue, Mango lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemons, Virgin mojito, Masala cola. Out of all the mocktails, Masala cola and mango Lassi stood out and were the best. The other mocktails were equally good and refreshing.

Delicious appetizers:

Crispy Veg: A variety of vegetables deep fried and garnished with aromatic flavors was something that wasn’t new that we didn't have, but it tasted excellent!

Corn 65: It tasted absolutely delicious. Corn balls deep fried and then garnished with mayo to give the 65 feel! Thoroughly recommended.

Bangla Kodi: Which was a signature dish of the restaurant, but for us it was a dish that also stood apart.

Chilli prawns: Spicy, stirred fried, It tasted awesome.

Tender chicken: The star of the appetizers. Brest chicken fillets dipped and fried with bread crumb batter. Highly recommended, please don't miss out on this dish.

Apollo fish: So it was a fish. Apart from that about the taste was okays’ish.

Main Course:

Chettinad Chicken: Very Spicy and it went absolutely well with the butter naan.

Kolhapuri Chicken: Mild flavours, the taste was good!

Uluvacharu Chicken Biryani: This was the highlight of the dinner, unique taste and flavors, the restaurant lived up to the name of Biryani, Highly Recommended.

Avakai Chicken biryani: A novel kind of taste for me and I really liked it.

Afghani chicken Biryani: Mild flavor biryani topped with Egg-omelet, It tasted really good.

Desserts:

Qubani ka meetha, Junnu and Gulab Jamun were served to us and we were extremely dissatisfied with the desserts. I earnestly request the effective management to please look into the dessert part. Everything else made it a great evening to hang out with family and friends for good Indian biryani Flavours.

Biryani and more, a new outlet in Gachibowli is fine-dine restaurant.
It has recently opened and serves varieties of biryani and other food dishes.
This restaurant is on the ground floor and can be easily spotted by the crowd passing by the road.
I’ve been here for a dinner session.
The ambience of this place is quite good with bright lights all over the place.
It was a weekend and there was a pretty good amount of crowd at that time.
We started with mocktails.
They had many varieties of mocktails,out which we ordered the sparkling blue,ginger cola,mango lassi,ginger lemon and ginger mojito.
All the mocktails were of different colours making them very appealing for us to drink.
Almost all the mocktails had mint,lemon and ice which was refreshing!
The mango lassi was too sweet.
Then we were served with soups,
Veg lemon coriander soup
Chicken manchow soup
The veg lemon coriander soup was served hot with parboiled broccoli.
The chicken manchow soup was full of flavour and was served with crispy fried noodles,it tasted delicious.
We were then served with starters,
Apollo fish:
The fish was well cooked and soft but had so much of salt in it.
Tender chicken:
This was something very tasty,the chicken was soft,tender and with good amount of spice.
Bangla kodi:
It is one of the most popular dishes,it was crispy,light and was well presented with coriander garnish.
The chilli prawns:
The prawns were juicy,spicy and had great flavour.
Crispy veg and corn 65 were other vegetarian starters which we had.
They also were good but not that great.
Next we were served with main course:
They served us different types of curry’s with Indian breads.
The chicken chetinadu,its a spicy chicken curry which was too good.
The other curry’s were chicken tikka masala,tomato cashew nut and ulvacharu chicken.
The ulvacharu chicken,a chicken curry with horse gram soup was outstanding and finger licking good.

Biryanis:
We were then served biryani.
avakai chicken biryani
Afghani chicken biryani

Avakai chicken biryani is a authentic Andhra dish,it had a wonderful taste still haunting.
Afghani chicken biryani is very different from other biryani,it had unique flavour.
It was served with egg omelet above the biryani .
We ended up our meal with deserts,
Qubani ka meetha,gulab jamun and junnu.
The deserts were not that great and had disappointed me.
Overall the restaurant has good biryani’s and I would suggest everyone to visit this place especially for avakai chicken biryani.

The real problem is that the place is quite congested in the first place. You will have to go quite early to avoid wait time. But that didn’t help us either. I was extremely disappointed with the service. We waited for almost like 1 hour for the food to arrive. By the time the veg food arrived (add on is that the soup came after starters were brought), our non-veg friends were having the main-course. The staff was not apologetic at all.

Diners Pavilion,Raj Yadav,"I went to the Diners Pavilion, Gachibowli on April 14, 2019 at 8:15 PM to attend the birthday party of my friend's child's birthday. I asked security about valet parking and he said, yes there is valet parking, so I gave key to park my car. In fact, that security guy was very unprofessional, and He never told me that there is no valet and he parked my car in a non-parking area. I was shocked when I received a message from traffic police about challan which was issued on 15th Apr 2019 for traffic violation. In fact, it is very impractical, and owner should educate to security not to provide any wrong information. If restaurant does not have valet parking, then the customer has the responsibility to park her or his car.

With situation, I have no choice so I have paid the amount of challan, but would like to share my experience for awareness to others so individual can take care while parking their car based on valet parking.

Diners Pavilion,Urmita Das,"A go-to place in Gachibowli (especially for Team Lunches😃😃 ) since they have an amazing offer running now.
449/- AI for Veg and 549/- AI for Non Veg Buffet.

~Ambience (4.5/5)
The place looks pretty bright with a golden yellow theme Chandeliers and wooden furnitures...gives d place a Royal Feeling ✌️✌️

~Buffet Spread (4/5)
Coming to the buffet spread, I really loved the fresh and soothing welcome drink, probably cranberry juice it was.
As for the starters, there were so many options and service was good too even at the wee hours of a Friday Lunch afternoon.
I really loved the Cheese Broccoli, Crispy Corn and Chilli My among the veg ones.
And in my non veg options, Chicken hariyali Tikka, Fish Tikka were amazing.

Next comes the main course, although I was a little disappointed with so less variety of dishes here, but the starters already filled my hunger pangs and I could only taste some cucumber mayo salad and Some nicely cooked Chicken Dum Biryani with a an okayish Mutton Roganjosh.

Last but not the least, we ended our lunch with Hot Gulab Jamun along with vanilla ice cream. There were some cut fruits and butterscotch pastry too but they weren't that great.
Yet again a disappointment in Desserts Section!!😐😐😒

Diners Pavilion,Varanasi Vivek,"Visited this place for my team lunch, and the experience was pathetic.
PreBooked the tables online, got call back from restaurant asking for some advance money for the lunch. Something new which I didn’t come across in recent times. This somehow got sorted and when we came there for lunch,
They are on 3rd floor, when entered the lift - It was leaking water from its ceiling.
Entered restaurant, look was good, our tables were arranged, we said about number of veg and non veg plates. Starters were served on the table.
Service was very bad, slow and no one was very much bothered about refills, had to request multiple times for refills. Taste was mild, some lacked salt, some lacked spice. Over all starters were ok.
Then comes the main course and main culprit- when we reached for food, most of the bowls were empty. So waited for refill- in the meanwhile my eyes fell on available prawns curry. I got them in a bowl and few roties on my table. Prawns were raw.... yukkkkkkk.... not properly boiled and cooked. I said this to the manager out there, but got a cold response. I didn’t try anything else in main course, but some of my frnds said biryani was ok but others were bad.
Halwa, ice cream and cut fruits were on deserts.

When were were done with our lunch- then manager came and apologised for the prawns and asked me to retry as he got them prepared again for me - it made me feel privileged. Had discussed on other items with the manager, and got my prawns in a bowl. To my surprise this was even pathetic experience. He mixed the older ones with the new curry and made it even worse.

I Would highly not recommend this place.

Diners Pavilion,Sunil Prajapat,"My second visit to this place. Visited this restaurant once, back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed. This visit was better than the last one. Was here for a team lunch with my colleagues, we opted for the buffet.

The ambience of this place is decent. There were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven, there was no salt and pepper on the table, also there were no condiments. Upon requesting, the waiter served us Ketchup and Green chutney. As we sat, the waiters started serving the starters. They included hara bhara kabab, aloo tikki, garlic paneer, tandoori pineapple, crispy corn and Chilly eggs. Tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants. Crispy corn, hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good. The egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average.

Veg Tom Yum soup was decent. The main course was a bit disappointing. Paneer Butter Masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name Kashmiri Pulao wasn't actually Kashmiri Pulao. The two other Veg curries tasted average. The desserts consisted only Vanilla ice cream, Gulab Jamun and Moong dal halwa. This was probably the most distasteful Moong dal halwa I've ever eaten.

The service was prompt. But, this place didn't give me any reason to why I should visit again, at least for a buffet. The only way they're different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks. But I think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back.

I've visited places less than 1Km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food. If they can't increase the varieties, they should start serving different/new food compared to others because I'm not visiting again if I can have similar food (and better) somewhere else.

Food- We had a buffet. Starters were quite good, crispy corn n Apollo fish being the best of them. But really disappointed and dissatisfied with the main course. It was not at all good. Food was cold n tasteless. Same is the case with the desserts.

Service- Service was very good. They knew how to do their job well.

Ambience- it was good but not that lavish as it appears in the zomato pics. Overall it was good

Food- 3/5

Diners Pavilion,Varun R Nair,"Had the “Prawns Phad Thai Noodles” and “Veg Greek Salad”.

RATINGS ::

1. Food Quality : 5/5
One word: Fantabulous!

2. Food Quantity : 4/5
Veg Greek Salad - Medium bowl
Prawns Phad Thai Noodles - Large Bowl (5-6 big prawn chunks, egg chunks, variety of other veggie chunks)

3. Food Packaging : 3.5/5
Decent packaging. Hot on delivery.

4. Value for money : 4/5
Bit pricey on scale. However, the quality is flawless. Worth it!

--------------
1. Prawns Phad Thai Noodles :
Big chunks of prawns (around 5-6) with Thai style noodles. Best part was the additional veggie varieties (cut in style) and egg chunks added to it made it stand out beyond just regular prawn noodles. Veggies were carrot, mushrooms, cucumber, onion etc.
Moderately spicy. A drink like ‘lassi/buttermilk’ would complement well.

2. Veg Greek Salad :
Standard fresh veggie salad containing cucumbers, tomato, black olives, onions etc. with a happy twist of creamy raita. 
The cream and raita accentuated the taste of the salad tenfold. 
True exhibition of healthy yet tasty food.

Diners Pavilion,Devesh Padmey,"The service was disappointing. The servers were in some hot mess - confused how to circulate the starters. We were five members, we got the table promptly as we had prior reservation. We decided to take the buffet. We were told that starters are being served pretty much like some other joints. The sitting arrangement in the restaurant is haphazard, mismatching furniture (probably some kind of interiors they thought to make a different style statement - which is not an issue for me). The welcome drinks were served only for 4 members in the beginning. Had to remind them to serve one more. Only three plates were provided, so after a wait of 5 minutes, the rest two of us got our plates. We told them, almost 3-4 different staff members, that two of us were opting for non-veg and three are vegetarian. They would either serve vegetarian options at a time or non vegetarian and then totally forget our table for 10-15 mins. We had to remind them to serve us more. Plus, they kept bringing the same starter again and again, despite telling us that there are other starters too. For e.g. crispy corns arrived at our table - I lost the count how many times! Some starters arrived only once. Some veg starters were cold !! Almost after 45 mins, the two chicken starters that they told us in the beginning arrived.  Main course was alright. After spending an hour, my appetite was already gone. I still made a selection of prawn curry, it was delicious. I had it with naan and some rice as well. Desserts were also running out of supply by the time we were ready for it. Overall, the whole excitement of having a team lunch at this place was lost, mostly due to poor service.",2,"2 Reviews , 1 Follower",5/31/2018 19:02,0,,"{'food': ['prawn curry', 'naan', 'rice'], 'drink': []}"

Veggies overloaded in noodles and the sweet,sour and spicy flavor in gobi chilli was astounding. It's been 2years in Gachibowli and this turned out to be the best chilli and noodles I have ever had here. The garlic aroma in gobi chilli and the sourness was remarkable.

No way to remove them.

I would recommend this place to non vegetarians. Order veg and get non veg for the price of veg!

While everything seemed and tasted good, Gobi Manchurian missed the spot. Under impression of regular Manchurian balls i ordered this meal box but got regular Gobi dipped in Manchurian sauce. This spoiled the whole taste as at each bite you taste Gobi instead of Manchurian sauce. A new way but not for me.

Asian Meal Box,Saloni Gupta🧁,"#Vegetarian review
Chinese cravings and I found this place to order!! I will now be a frequent customer of this chinese place because i loved my food. I ordered paneer Manchurian with tossed noodles. After discount i got them for 120 bucks which is a decent amount to pay for a meal for one. The quantity was not a lot but yes sufficient enough for one person.

The noodles were perfectly cooked. Rightly chopped veggies in right amount. Right sauces, perfectly sour. I loved the noodles.
The paneer Manchurian was a little on the drier side to go with the noodles, the paneer was a bit stiff too, but the gravy was amazing.

All in all it was a happy meal 😃 Must try!!!

4) You guys charged me for the ketchup which was never found in the package.

Went to buy their sourdough bread.ended up having their mushroom soup, death by chocolate cake and key lime tart.

The bread itself we ended up using as garlic bread with our pasta at home which was really good. The bread is something we will go again to buy.

Lime tart Was better than expectation . The cream was way too much.

Death by chocolate was delicious, rich chocolate. Was not able to finish in one go, will have to get on it tomorrow again.

We ordered Basque Chicken Sandwich and Very Cheesy Panini accompanies with an Iced Latte. 

The chicken sandwich was delicious with crispy sourdough bread and juicy chicken inside. The bread tasted fresh and the sourness was accentuating the flavors. Served with crispy potato wedges and a coleslaw, the whole meal is quite filling.

The very cheesy panini was prepared with wholewheat bread and had a distinct cheese flavor to it. It could have worked with a little more spice but that doesnt meant the flavors were any less. 

Both the sandwiches were gulped down with the iced latte served in a tall glass.

Service was quick and the ambiance was pleasant with good music on play. 

Althought a bit on the pricier side, the menu offers a lot of variety and the place is recommended for their signature sandwiches prepared with their home baked bread.

I loved the ambience, food and service.

We ordered a Chicken Sausage Roll, English Lamb Panini and Spanish Omelette with Hash Browns.
We also had a Roasted Pineapple Yogurt Smoothie.

The Sausage was lovely, and I loved the dressing on the salad. The meat in the panini was extremely well cooked.

The Smoothie had a zing, and was very refreshing.

If you are looking for a doughnut, please move away from those factory line produced, dense, overtly sweet and miserly filled ones. (It's about time they dunk themselves in a pot of acid.) Eclat's doughnuts are exactly what the deep fried yet fluffy bites of joy should be. The Berliners are generously filled and are light enough not to stick to your teeth.

The New York Cheesecake is one of the best I've had in terms of texture. It's rich and flaky when the fork hits it and absolutely melts as soon as it touches your tongue. I do recommend cutting back on the cinnamon a tad bit to ensure it allows the flavours of the cheese to shine through.

The chocolate cake is decadent and comfortably ranks one among the best in the city. The key lime tart is full of flavour with the right balance of tang and sweet.

Old review:
                         This place was on my bookmark list for a while and I was excited to visit it on Saturday. We ordered a mushroom quiche, a primavera pizza and a grilled vegetable panini.The mushroom quiche was alright but what knocked me out was the price. It was a relatively small piece with a spoon of caramalized onions and a small amount of onions and salad and they charge 150 rupees for that. The pizza was about 9 inches and tasted alright. But its a whopping 500 rupees. The grilled panini is pretty much the same.I know the restaurant is all about european cuisine but they dont have to make their prices european as well. I had pizzas or quiche that tasted a lot better at a cheaper price. Dont get me wrong the food isnt horrible but its alright.

For starters ordered - Chicken Broccoli Melt and Stuffed Bell Peppers. 

Chicken Broccoli Melt is basically garlic bread with a mixture of chicken, broccoli and cheese on top. The plate served to us is cold, we were told it is in fact properly cooked but broccoli tasted raw. Luckily the chicken is not raw! Bread is very hard and difficult to eat. Overall not worth ordering. 

Stuffed Bell Peppers - Tasted just ok. But loads of spinach used as stuffing and it kind of brought down the taste as a whole. 

Aglio E Olio - No complaints about this one. Tasted fine. 

Cabonara Chicken Pasta - So bland and tasteless we were not able to complete this. 

Quattro Formaggi Pizza - It is very difficult to spoil a pizza these days and even small road side establishments are churning out pizzas that taste good. So much for the authentic 4 types of european cheese used for this one but the taste is very weird and the after taste is really bad.

The preparation is rich, fresh and gives a good after feeling once you've eaten it. I'd specifically mention the croissants that just melt in your mouth. The Almond Croissant, Pain Au Chocolat are must try. Tomato and Cheddar Cheese Croissant too is something that was different and relishing. The hot chocolate beverage too was consistent and wasn't too sweet or bitter, it was just apt.

I'd certainly go to this place repeatedly and try the other items too.

Cafe Eclat,Divya Iyer,"The first time I had something from Cafe Eclat was when we ordered Snack-boxes for a work event. Though a tad pricey, everything in that box was fresh and delicious - especially the complimentary brownie they had added.

We then went to to try out breakfast at this place. They have all the items that make a good continental breakfast, and also a variety of Omelettes. We ordered the Omelette meal, and the spinach and broccoli Omelette. We also ordered one of the pancakes for my daughter. Everything arrived fresh and hot, and tasted great. In fact, I am wondering how I let go of the Belgian waffles on their menu. The portion sizes were perfect and made for an indulgent start to the day.

The next I visited was for a midnight dessert run, and tried the Rocher Caramel - which is basically chocolate mousse encrusted in a nutty rocher, much like your Ferrero Rocher, only larger. Man, that was huge and filled me up completely, but was worth every penny. 

So yes, the place is definitely pricey, but I have to say that they serve you the price's worth in taste and quality. Great place with many options, so must try!",4,"13 Reviews , 50 Followers",5/10/2018 18:16,0,,"{'food': ['Snack-boxes', 'Omelette meal', 'Pancakes', 'Rocher Caramel'], 'drink': []}"

Cafe Eclat,Aditi Upadhyay,"The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.

Salads, Chat, North Indian, Continental to South Indian, this place tends to fulfil the cravings of each category. There was a huge section of Salads out of which Bacon salad being the pick of the lot. The Starters spread included Hummus varieties with dry and soft pita breads, Farm fresh cheese varieties which were a delight, Live chat and Pasta counters, Tawa fish, Fish fry, Chicken starters, Pork pepperoni, Sauted mushrooms, Chicken Salami, Bacon, Sausages etc.  

The Main course had Chicken Haleem which was okaish, Chicken Biryani which was good, Mutton curry where I felt the pieces were undercooked, Mirchi ka salan, Veg Biryani and some veg curries. The main course could have been better in terms of the standard of taste set by the starters. Prawns and Crab items were missing which could have furthermore enhanced the visit experience. The desserts section was an absolute joy for sweeth tooth. They had a humungous spread of sweets which included Chocolate burfi sandwich, mud pudding, motichoor laddu, Barfis, Moong dal Halwa, Phirni, Fruit kheer etc. The pastries section had a lot to offer in terms of various flavours and varieties.

Feast is one of the biggest spreads I saw in a buffet.. It has continental, Chinese and Indian cuisine and chats with a huge variety.. The ambiance is decent.. But Probably it could be improved..

I would like first start with the desserts section.. There are many.. The very sight can be deadly to a diabetic patient.. Perfect place for ppl with a sweet tooth.. A big selection of pastries, cheese cakes along with many Indian specialties..

There was chicken, fish and mutton for starters.. I couldn't see prawns.. Chicken popcorn was so crispy on the outside and the chicken soft in the inside.. The best starter of all.. The other starters are okeyish..

In the main course, chciekn biryani and Lal Maas were the best.. Overall a very good experience.. 👍

We started the food but soon we realized that we have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection. We opted to go with Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food was cold, not even warm. I did not like the food much. It was not even okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Only real-time cooked food was hot like pasta, roti. Anyway, we finished our food and came back. Now in the night, my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest water as well. The whole night he was vomiting. And, in the morning my wife stared do vomiting. We rushed to the hospital [Continatal] and the doctor clearly said it is food poising. We went to flashback and realized my wife and younger son had come vegetable team, which may have caused the vomiting. Eldor son had pasta so he was good.

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Shivam,"With the name you definitely expect and hope a lot but when it comes to reality, everything fails.

I had a vegetarian buffet and the spread was limited. There was no paneer in starters which is any vegetarians heart. And when i asked if they can prepare (with the huge cost of ₹1750 involved) they couldn't.

Also the taste of other items is not upto the mark.

The only good thing i can remember is Aaloo tiki chaat.

I would recommend you to plan somewhere, even if it's a team dinner, though mine was not!

It's not even worth ₹ 500 and i am definitely not going to Sheraton again!",1,"19 Reviews , 39 Followers",2/11/2019 17:11,0,,"{'food': ['paneer', 'Aaloo tiki chaat'], 'drink': []}"

Shakes are good, chilly and refreshing.
My personal favorite being Oreo Shake.

Ambience-(3.5/5) The place is cool, can hangout and can have quality talk, as it is mostly empty and most orders generally are take aways.

One thing, they should at least keep the tables CLEAN. There were so many dead flies and insects on the tables which would bring disgust.

Service-(4/5) They know their work, prepare the shakes well. One suggestion is to provide water to the customers, as it seems ridiculous that you deny with the fact that you guys don't have water.

The shakes are categorized into premium and classic and each category has lots of flavors to choose from and the taste is amazing. They have all flavors of premium chocolates like lindt, toblerone to local chocolates of India. The containers that shakes are given in could have been of better quality.
There are only two snack items available French Fries and Potato wedges and I feel being such a franchise they should have added more options. But the variety of toppings given makes good sense.

New menu is interesting. Happy to see savoury items on the menu as well.

Tried Coffee hazelnut shake - must say the coffee is neither mild nor overpowering, just the right amount and was good. It's loaded with whipped cream topped with choco chips.

Caramel Brownie shake--- now this is a stealer. Would give a 5 just for this. Probably the best caramel shake I ever had. Total yumminess. Even the colour is drool worthy. A must try here. Yes the sugar content is high and too sweet. Some pampering for your sweet tooth.

Peri peri fries - how interesting is it to get options for your fries, when you even love them as such. I opted for peri peri spice and it tasted good and is for someone who really like their fries spicy

Tempteys,Asad Rana,"Sunday afternoon we visited this place with the bunch of foodies to experience their new menu which has been added recently. Small outlet with around 15 people can be accommodated at a time.

Coming to the delicacy,
Classic shakes - Poppy cherry and merry cherry were the two shakes which have tried. Poppy cherry was just like butter popcorn shake was decent. Merry cherry was simply outstanding and loved it.
Premium shakes - Cruncy blue berry & Caramel brownie were my favorites. These are the must tried shakes at this place.
Exclusive shake - Coffee hazlenut and cookie feast were delicious too. Cheesecake was decent nothing that great.
Crushers - Orange bright, Poppy corn, mint cucumber are some of the crushers which we tried but all were ok.
Fries - Peri Peri Fries and Cajun spice fries were really outstanding and loved it.
Potato wedges - this one was decent with Jamaican dips.

Overall there new menu is quite a hit and have some amazing exclusive and premium shake which is not too heavy on the pocket and tasty at the same time. As we were invited here by management for the new menu session but will visit again for sure in future to taste other shakes and delicacies.

Tempteys,Neha Patnaik,"A Sunday afternoon and desserts, definitely makes an awesome combination added to which I had piri piri flavoured Potato wedges and french fries. All under one roof which makes Temptys different from rest.

I in a group of 8 landed this Sunday afternoon to relish their newly added shakes and flavoured snacks.

We were served with Poppy Corn & Merry Cherry as a part of their classic shakes, Caramel Brownie, Crunchy Blue & Berry, Mint o fruit from their premium shakes, Coffee Hazelnut & Cookie feast from their Exclusive shakes and Minty Cucumber, poppycorn and blue and berry from their slush sections.

The perfect shakes were: Poppy Corn, Caramel Brownie and Crunchy Blue & Berry. Poppy corn just took my heartaway. The perfect aroma of corn and it was an add on to this autumn. Caramel Brownie will definitely be favourites to all the chocolate and brownie lovers. Honestly, blue berry flavoured desserts have become my one of the favourite pick in desserts lately.

These are must trial from here. I have never come across any shake which such an amazing variety flavoured taste.

The snacks behaves cherry on the top with piri piri flavour. Someone once said you eat food first with your eyes then with nose and finally you get to taste it. These snacks surpasses everything. The potato wedges and french fries were crispy and had the exemplary colour.

Worth a visit for their special add ons in the menu.

Tempteys,Sugandha Saxena,"Tempteys recently revamped their menu, and we got a chance to try the additions at their Gachibowli outlet. This outlet is a mere walking distance away from DLF, and easily locatable in the building next to Vijaya Bank.

All their shakes come with the options of 2 bases Gelato (icecream) and Avalanche (yoghurt). Here's a list of the new ones, and how they fared.

Poppy corn: It looks quite plain, but one sip, and you'll be amazed at the smoky flavour of popcorn hitting you from the sweet shake.
Merry cherry and Crunchy Forest Berry are for those who love the berries.
If you're a Mint enthusiast, do try the Mint o Fruit shake.
For those who can't get enough of cookie shakes, Cookie Feast comes in with Oreo and Little Hearts stacked on the top.
Coffee addicts can try the very appealing Coffee Hazelnut, which was absolutely a pretty sight too!
My personal favourite, though, was Caramel Brownie. The flavour of caramel, with chewy chunks of brownie, and a topping of whipped cream 😍 heavenly!
Another good one was the Cheese Cake shake. It felt like a fruit cake, blended into a shake, and is good if you enjoy that flavour.
There's a whole set of flavours of slushies as well.

Just in case, it gets too sweet, they have French Fries and Potato Wedges, available in a total of 8 flavours. They come in cute little boxes, that you can probably carry away too! We tried and absolutely loved the Chilli Garlic, Real White cheese, and Cajun Spice flavours.
At 89 bucks, they're quite good to be honest.
Do give them a try whenever you're around!

Tempteys,Forever_fooodie,"What I love about their shakes are they are not very high in sugar. So sugars don't kill the flavors expected in that shake...!!!

Tried:

poppy corn: Absolutely loved the flavor. You could get a clear flavor of popcorns. Would recommend to try if you love popcorns.

old granola (honey loops) Again amazing. One of the must tries.

berry cherry: Good amount of berries, great flavor. Recommended.
caramel Brownie: This was also pretty good. I am. personally not a caramel flavor lover, so not my fav.

coffee hazel nut: This was just WOW. must have for coffee lovers. They were really generous in putting the coffee in the shake :D. It had a strong coffee flavor. So if you are a true coffee lover you'll like it. ;)
Cheesecake (tuti fruity) : It had exactly tuti fruity flavor. Didn't like it much.
oreo and little hearts (cookie feast): Oreo shake never fails.. :) It was good.
Blueberry slush: I didn't like the slush though. it only seemed to have color but no taste.

Mint o fruit: I don't like mint flavors at all. And was ofc Minty. So not my fav. If you like mint flavors it's for you.

They have different toppings for french fries and potato wedges and they are all just soooo amazing... Must Try.

It has got a nice decor and the seating was very comfortable and relaxed. We were the only customers inside this place during our one hour stay.

I ordered a Coffee Latey Shake [Rs.169] and my friend ordered a Coffee Caramelo Shake [Rs.169]. Both the shakes were really nice and thick. They are made with a blend of lots of ice cream, caramel, coffee and topped with whipping cream.

On my second visit to this place I tried it's Go Guava Shake [Rs.145] and it is my favorite. It tasted awesome with plenty of ice cream blended with guava and topped with Guava crush.

Presentation- Looked lovely and the gum paste flowers on it just made our mouths to water. The colour was sharp and had the perfect blend of black and white. The presentation was superb. 4/5

Delivery- Got everything delivered on time. Nothing outstanding. 3.5/5

Cake- Now this is what was actually not good enough. The black forest tasted much different than any other black forest.

Black Forest Cake- A really huge cake for a good number of people. It tasted exactly like elaichi and nowhere like black forest. A damp squib. 1/5
