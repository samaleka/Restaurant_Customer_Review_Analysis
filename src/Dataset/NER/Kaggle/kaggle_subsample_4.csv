Pot Pourri,Chandrasekhar Dasika,"*IF YOU ARE READING THIS, AND SITLL GOING TO THIS PLACE - EITHER YOU WORK THERE OR YOU ARE DU#B*
*I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE FAMILIES WITH KIDS FROM VISITING THIS PLACE*

*WRITING THIS REVIEW WITHIN 10 HOURS OF VISITING THIS PLACE*

Wish I could give a negative rating. This place is ridiculously lazy. No this review is not about food, cost or ambience. This is about people and their mindset.

810pm: four of us including two kids aged kids aged 2 and 7 step in

815pm: another large party and a couple of other families check-in

820pm: menu card was give to us

830pm: someone walked over to take the order but not before taking orders for other two parties (thug life!). We order Veg Biriyani, two rotis and Kadai Paneer

845pm: remind them about the order; said we need a couple of minutes

845pm: other groups already served food

850pm: remind them about the order; informed it will take another couple of minutes. My two year old son already started crying for food; elder daughter clearly getting irritated

855pm: again informed it will take a couple of minutes. i said I will walk out if food doesnt come in 30s.

856pm: our family walks out in front of the staff. Staff doesnt make the slightest attempt to stop us

The last part obviously indicates they havent started the preparation yet. So no loss in letting us leave.

The sheer apathy of staff was quite overwhelming. I can understand being profit centric and your obvious need to serve a bigger party. But with two hungry kids kept waiting for more than 45 min at your place without any food being offered smacks of apathy and insensitivity (after being reminded about it). And in this time and age of digital pervasiveness, beign careless about it is inviting trouble.",1,"5 Reviews , 29 Followers",5/13/2019 12:48,0,,"{'food': ['Veg Biriyani', 'two rotis', 'Kadai Paneer'], 'drink': []}"
Pot Pourri,Saikrishna Javvaji,"went for A-LA-Carte here.. Heard a lot about this previously. went with full of excitement. I wanna rate this restaurant in 3 aspects. 1. Ambience: I should say it is just OK. they could have done it much better. Looks like they have spent a lot on establishment but no aww factor. 2.Taste: The food tastes good here. Almost every main course and starter were good except the dessert - Carrot Halwa and Mango Juice(Welcome Drink). They both didn't taste good. 3.Hospitality: The Hospitality is quite good.

Pot Pourri,Prasant Kumar,"All Star to the Food, Service and ambience... We were looking for a good banquet or Restaurant in Gachibowli area to celebrate our 10th Marriage anniversary. As the moment was special we were looking for a place where we can enjoy the time with family and friends. Searched almost 5-6 locations but bottomed down to Pot Pourri. Were little concerened if made the right choice...but VOILA.. on the event day we were very very happy to see the below specific observations:
1.Quality of Food - We have given few instructions on the buffet spread and also asked for North Indian taste in food. The instructions that we have given was executed line by line...not an inch of difference... Food was great...I got lot of enquires from guests that how did I locate this place... Very Very satisfied... Must taste from my side- Bengal fish curry and Nizami Handi..

The starters typically was in taking terms among the guests... Awsome..

2. Service- The staff was courtious and they took care of each guests personally.. It was no less than a private party, though we havn't booked the restaurant fully...but seeing the service we  were very happy... 

3. Ambience- The restaurant is cleanly decorated..not so much noise in decor... As we want a special moment and we were in doubt how to setup the environment with some personal touch, the staff themselves took the lead and asked for few items in the morning...and when we entered in the evenning we were quite surprised to see the decoration just the right.. this is called the owning of stuff... 

Kudos to the staff and management for taking our request and customizing every bit of the arrangements as per the need of the event... VERY HAPPY...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...ALL STARS...",5,"1 Review , 1 Follower",4/29/2019 8:51,0,,"{'food': ['Bengal fish curry', 'Nizami Handi'], 'drink': []}"

We went in for the √Ä la carte. The service was a bit slow, they need to speed up on that. We ordered crispy baby corn. Usually not a fan of corn, but loved this one. Also, the masala papad was a good one. We went ahead with the main course. The kadai paneer and rumali roti were good. Would give it a 3.5/5.

Pot Pourri,Parijat Ray,"We visited this restaurant recently. We have ordered Potpourri Royyala Vepudu, Gongura Mamsam ( not there in the menu, they have made it on our request ) and plain rice.

Potpourri Royyala Vepudu: A south Indian style prawn ( medium sized ) starter (dry). This dish had at least 15-20 prawns. The prawns were coated and cooked in spices. The prawns were little chewy in texture but was very tasty.

Gongura Mamsam: Small pieces of mutton cooked in a gongura based gravy. We found this dish too sour ( I guess they have added tamarind too ) compared to our previous experience with Gongura based gravy.

Overall experience was nice. The service was good.",3,"146 Reviews , 333 Followers",4/8/2019 19:20,2,,"{'food': ['Potpourri Royyala Vepudu', 'Gongura Mamsam'], 'drink': []}"

Pot Pourri,Akarsh Prabhu,"Had been here to taste authentic andhra/telangana Cuisine. 
Tried the Cashew chicken starter and the Prawn biriyani. 

The starter was nothing but boneless chicken fried in some bland batter with fried cashew stuck to it. It looked like some home made beginner dish. It was really dry. The server even forgot to give me chutney with it. 

The only thing andhra about the biriyani was the spice level. It was above normal levels. Otherwise no special flavour. The dish didnt have enough salt , which we added later, OURSELF. 
There was some birthday party going on, because of which each dish took an hour to get to us. 

After all this hassle, they give  us complimentary gulab jamun from the buffet which was nowhere a compensation for the bad experience or for the price we paid. 

I am just hoping this isnt the real telangana cuisine which it is famous for and I was just at the wrong place.",2,"5 Reviews , 69 Followers",4/3/2019 17:03,0,,"{'food': ['Cashew chicken starter', 'Prawn biriyani'], 'drink': []}"
Pot Pourri,Afreen Jahan,"*Writing this review as soon as I got out of the restaurant*
From the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience. Left right after starters. I wouldn't even care to rate it one star. One of worst restaurants to dine-in. I think it'll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more theüí∞üí∞üí∞
After reaching at 2 PM there was no receptionist. After the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people. It was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged. That's it. A piece of advise to y'all: if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there. Neither proper AC chambers nor proper cooling. It was HOT. Thanks POT POURRI for understanding and making our dining uncomfortableüòí. After we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we're opting for veg or non-veg. By this time I was already wondering if they thought we're idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want, I just realised that it was true.
After soup and buttermilk starters were served PAINFULLY SLOW. It took MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR THEM TO FINISH SERVING JUST 6 STARTERS. Were they kidding me?? They wasted my precious time and this isn't what a customer wants. If you can't give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere. We had to school the waiters regarding their service, then we spoke to their leader(I guess) and he also gave the same old typical answer ""sorry. I'll just get that served for you"". We don't want no sorry. You can't placate us with sorry for our time, hard work and money spent. After seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to ""sorrys"". I decided to leave the restaurant. After all this HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE US THE COMPLETE BILL. It was 1100. It wasn't even worth it even if we had the whole menu. After arguing he decided to give 10% discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we hadüòí. Wouldn't suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant.
Starters: I found the starters to be normal good in quality. Not very impressive nor was menu standing out. If you pay 100-200 more you'll be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food.
1. Soup: we were served chicken soup. It wasn't impressive. It was fine.
2. Buttermilk under drinks: it was tasty.
3. Chicken tikka: it was ok. It was hard, sometimes soft.
4. Ajwani paneer tikka: it was very good in taste.
5. Kodi vepudu: it was chicken with common known marination. I mean it felt like typical Indian curry. It was just good.
6. Fried veg green chilli: it was just ok in taste. Couldn't make out if it's actually chilly.
7. Corn fried fish: it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste. Probably this is the only best thing there.
8. Crispy corn: corn was crispy as expected and tasted good.
Main course: I found it to be typically common. Nothing new if you've been to buffets before.
Accompaniments were regular papad, curd, naan, roti.
Desserts: not much varieties. What's there is menu is served.
Ambience: I don't care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience isn't tested.",1,"60 Reviews , 16 Followers",3/29/2019 16:49,15,,

Pot Pourri,Sreekanth Koppula,I have been to this place for my team lunch on 22nd Feb. We opted for buffet. Just to serve the soup they took 20 mins and starters for another 15 mins. Apparently they didn‚Äôt serve the soup to all my team members and when we tried talking to the manager he was not available neither the servers.

Have tried multiple dishes from this place so this is kind of a general review. 

The chicken biryani is their specialility. Large fragrant rice which are flaky and yet not oily provide a perfect blend with juicy chicken pieces. Only note is that they serve with one giant chicken piece in the biryani. Smaller pieces would make the biryani more manageable. The quantity is definitely something where even 4 people can easily enjoy a meal.

We tried their haleem too in this Ramzan and it was delicious. Creamy texture with generous chunks of mutton and a small spicy kick to the taste, something which I really prefer in my haleem. 

Avoid going for a dine-in given the crowd but for home delivery, this is a place where you can order anything with eyes closed.

Hello Peeps;
People Around Us Say Pista House , Pista House During Ramzan Just Because They Prepare Haleem well.

I Was literally Waiting For A Free Time To Go & Have Haleem .
Then Seeing The Very Big Queue Outside The Pista House I Decided To Go Home & Order.

I Ordered Mutton Haleem , Naan & Paneer Butter Masala.
Naan & Paneer Butter Masala Were Mouth Watering To Look At & Even Tasted Soooo Good!!!

Haleem Wasn't that excellent. It Was Ok Ok Because They Added A Lotss Of Spices Like Black Pepper & Cloves.

üëâüëâIt's Irritating When You Chew Haleem & Get Lots Of Cloves In Between When You Chew ( I hope You Understood, Lol)

Paneer Butter Masala : Quantity Was Sufficient For 5 Naans. I Would Rate 5 For The Taste. But I would Rate this Restaurant Upon Haleem Only.

Haleem Taste : As I Said , Not As Expected. It Was Just Ok. Cloves Spoiled My Cup Of Haleem.

We had ordered for 2 Egg biriyani,  there was no Flavour, gravy or taste in that, it is just a coloured biriyani rice with Fried Boiled Eggs. See the Photo.

Two of us dont eat chicken or meat and it was served on our plates.  

We ended up not eating that second bowl of biriyani except for few spoonful, we were charged for that biriyani, after some discussion they reduced the  price of 1 biriyani from our bill.

Pista House,Girish Reddy,"Went for a team lunch. The place is opposite Care Hospital.

Ambiance

This place has normal ambiance as all the other Irani hotels. The problem is that there are a lot of Swiggy delivery boys and they waiting outside the door to collect their parcels. We felt bad sitting there while they were peering inside in the hot sun and us eating there.

Food quality

We ordered three items

1. Devils Chicken
: Chewy chicken coated. This was the best dish of the lot

2. Tandoori Chicken
: fully burnt, coated with ghee to hide the bad quality

3. Premium Biryani: This was really bad. When people go to a Irani style hotel, there are some expectations. We like Biriyani dum cooked. This particular Biriyani costed 650 and came in a slightly large bowl. Please be careful as this can only serve 3 people. The Rice was passable and the Biriyani was fully mixed..... Not the layering like it is supposed to be. It textured like a pulao with the masala . The chicken manchuri in it was cold and the coating had fallen off... You can tell that is was stale. The Chicken pieces were only bones. the mutton pieces were not existent.

This looks like a outlet which is run by fake people.

Biryani and food items in traditional hotels like Paradise, Shah Ghouse, Mehfil, Shahdab, Bawarchi are really good. The tandoori chicken will normally be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.

The service took a long time in coming. It looks like they are short of staff. People will go there by the name and feel bad. I feel the Pista house owners should look into quality and quantity issues.

Pista House,Piyush Das,"I am so disappointed with what I just had today from Pista House, Gachibowli, that I don't think it would be sensible on my part to even award a single star rating, but unfortunately, zomato is not allowing me to publish the review without rating , hence this 1 star.

I have had Mutton Kheema Biriyani earlier from Pista House - Kondapur & Nizampet, both of which were awesome and of the same taste & make, however, the same didn't turn true for Kheema biriyani from the Gachibowli outlet.  All my friends who had the biriyani today shares the same opinion, so, I am not being overly critical at all. I don't understand, how such reputed brands/chain do not maintains consistency of taste & recipe across all the outlets, they do maintain consistency with the prices though..

Not sure, if Pista House would be be even interested to take this comment seriously OR act upon it to get things better for next time, but, at least I request that they don't cheat on their customer's expectations.

What was bad with the biriyani -

1. It was all rice and no kheema
2. This is NOT at all the same recipe that is being served in other outlets (Nizampet & Kondapur)
3. Trivial though - but the packaging is also inconsistent as compared to other outlets ( while other outlets packs in Container , Pista House - Gachibowli deliver in foil packet )

Moving on to the good part, the food was cleaner than most non veg places in Hyderabad with the Chicken having a little less oil than most places. The desserts looked sumptuous (even though I was full for them, I manged to take some pictures of them)

Marsala Food Company,Jayson J Jariwala,"Yesterday we visited this place at 8:30pm. We are 10 people. There was not that much rush in restaurant. If you are going with Zomato gold offer, they will treat as beggar who came to eat without paying any money. Overall very worst experience. Tomato soup with weird smell. We ordered Kung Pao Mahroom as a starter but I can't feel Kunng pao taste in mashroom starter at all. it feels like mashroom chilli. We ordered Baby Corn Masala*2 and Paneer lababadar*2 as Main course and we observed that they served very less quantity compare to other tables as we have zomato gold. They added Baby corn and Paneer pieces which we can easily count. There is more gravy then vegetables, paneer and baby corns as like roadside restaurant usually serve. Even Service is really slow on regular days. I don't know how they manage on weekend. Waiters are very lazy and behaving like they are customers. Best thing is only ambiance.

When the ambience is good, it already makes half the things right

All of them tasted heaven, but our personal fav was Paneer Papdi Kabab, Chicken Lahori and Golden Fried Babycorn üíØ

Marsala Food Company,Hayavadan Rao / The DeccanFoodie,"I visited this place with my fellow bloggers. We had all come here for lunch. A place which has been always highly rated and this visit was pending for quite some time. We all came here with a lot of expectations and Marsala Food company didn't dissapoint us at all. We tasted a lot of items on the menu. The best and my personal favorite was the kit Kat shake. It was even better than the ones you get at the other shake outlets. The lemon Coriander soup was too lemony and was a bit sour and the veg Wonton Soup was good. It is not a must try and can be avoided ! Nothing special about it ! This was the only item that wasn't very good .Deep fried panner with a lot of masala ! Undoubtedly one of the best on the menu It is a must try and the special dish of the restaurant was the fried rice . the rice is topped with few Manchuria pieces and a lot of chopped vegetables. A treat for the mouth! We also ordered the veg curry and few rotis. We were all happy with the curry and rotis . The gulab jamun and the other deserts such as the kaddu ka kher and the double ka meetha were the stars of the day. Especially the gulab jamun !
Fresh and juicy dipped in the right quantity of sugar solution ! Even the people who don't have a sweet tooth will love it!

Marsala Food Company,Rameez Siddiqui,"Visited this place recently as it has become the talk of the town .
We started off with Paneer Papdi Kebab and Chilly Paneer with Crispy Corn and Veg Sheek kebab from the Veg starters. Extremely Delicious and my favorite was the Chilly Paneer.
The Non veg starters were haryali Fish Tikka ,Chilly Basil Prawns and Lahori Chicken Kebab.
The Chilly Basil Prawns were really good and perfect in every way.
The showstoppers were the Mutton Juicy Mandi and the Fish Mandi! Such a perfect taste of the Mandi rice. Can easily compete with Barkas Mandi Houses.
The Desserts, well we tried them all like the Apricot Delight , Shahi Tukda, kaddu ki kheer and my personal favourite Gulab Jamun.
The Awesome dish unknown to people who visit this place is the Kitkat Shake. Really Do try the Kitkat Shake.

Marsala Food Company,Meha Gupta,"Visited this place for the first time (team of 7 people) after checking out the rating and reviews. Not at all happy with the management and the staff.

1. Added few items in between for which we were made to wait for more than 30min with no response whenever asked for. We cancelled the order finally and also were made to pay for the cancelled items (INR 500 extra for the items cancelled).
Reason stated by the staff - if you won‚Äôt pay, it will be deducted from our salary.
2. When asked for salad (thrice), no one served. Ultimately, one of us, went to the buffet section and got the onions. Even this wasn‚Äôt noticed by anyone.
3. Not happy with the quality of food. Ordered ‚Äúpapdi paneer kebab‚Äù as per the staff recommendation. It was dry and not good. We told the guy who served and got no response for our concern.
4. There are many staff members but lack of management.

The ambience was nice and it was very spacious with good seating arrangement. The staff is very friendly and courteous. The service is also quite fast.
We first started off with Arabian chicken soup and a Veg soup.

Then we tried their starters Paneer papdi kebab, Veg sheekh kebab, Lahori chicken kebab, Golden fried babycorn, Fish hariyali, Chilli basil prawn, Chilli paneer and Crispy corn chilli pepper.

For the maincourse we first tried Grilled fish mandi and Mutton juicy mandi. I wished mandi was more flavourful but the grilled fish which was served with mandi saved the day.
Then we tried Special fried rice with veg manchurian, Special chicken noodles with chickeb manchurian and also Veg kolhari curry and butter chicken with few breads.

We also tried few mocktails Virgin mojito, Kotkat milkshake and Chocolate milkshkae.

We finally ended our meal with few desserts Gulab jamun, Apricol delight, Double ka meetha and Kheer",5,"75 Reviews , 174 Followers",3/28/2019 12:39,26,,"{'food': ['Arabian chicken soup', 'Paneer papdi kebab', 'Veg sheekh kebab', 'Lahori chicken kebab', 'Golden fried babycorn', 'Fish hariyali', 'Chilli basil prawn', 'Chilli paneer', 'Crispy corn chilli pepper', 'Grilled fish mandi', 'Mutton juicy mandi', 'Special fried rice with veg manchurian', 'Special chicken noodles with chickeb manchurian', 'Veg kolhari curry', 'Butter chicken with few breads', 'Virgin mojito', 'Kotkat milkshake', 'Chocolate milkshake'], 'drink': ['Virgin mojito', 'Kotkat milkshake', 'Chocolate milkshake']}"
Marsala Food Company,Syeda @food__vampire,"It was a lunch and was very hungry thought to head towards this place.
.
.

The place is quite good with spacious sitting area and decent ambience.
.
.
There are many varities available to eat where its mojitos, soups, starters, maincourse and the desserts not to forget the softdrinks the most important thing.
.
.
Had started with the lemon corriander souo and the arabian chicken soup....the best liked by me us the lemon corriander where the flavour of each ingeredient used to make the soup was felt in each sip.
..
..
Then the best to go with is the starters which includes the variety of eatables like fish hariyali, paneer papdi kabab which was good but less salt, lahori chicken kabab which was just awesom to have the tastiest one I had in a very long time, then comes the marg achari tikka which is again can stand against lahori kabab, then fish 65 was good , the golden fried babycorn which was so srumptious and welked fried ,then the veg sheek kabab which was the worst thing I tried honestly was not at all cooked properly no salt no chilli just wet piece of vegetables felt in mouth could not even eat that.
..
..
Then went ahead with prawns which was good ,then comes the crispy corn chilli pepper which was again a good one to go with.
..
..
The main course had the mouth waterting fish and mutton mandi which was really good but can be more organised if served more hot...the fish and mutton were cooked perefectly with soft texture felt......and not to forget the veg fried rice with manchuria again makes it fit to eat
..
..
Then had the virgin mojito and the kitkat shake which were perfectly made.
..
..
The most awaited and favourite part the dessert section
Which had the gulab jamun
The shahi tukda
The kuddi ki kheer
The khubani ka mittha.
...
...
Was happy and fulled after having this many varities of dishes.
..
..
Must visit this place to have a good experience of varities of different hyderabadi eatables.

Marsala Food Company,Tummyful_hyd,"Recently we were invited for a food tasting session here at Marsala Food Company! We had heard mixed reviews about this place soo wanted to check out how it actually is! Well to start with, as soon as we entered we were quite impressed by their interiors and their seating arrangement! They have the Arabian style of seating i.e sitting down on with the food placed on stools and also they have the normal high table seating for people who don't wish to sit down! The place is dimly lit and very calm! You can enjoy the food with an overview of the traffic passing from infront of the DLF gate no 3, opposite to which is this place Marsala Food Company! So after we settled down they brought in the soups, we had the Arabian Chicken soup and the Lemon coriander soup! We just loved the Arabian Chicken Soup, it was really tasty and the chicken pieces were very tender! Whereas the lemon coriander soup was a bit spicy which is quite unexpected and also we felt it could be a little more improved! Next came vast spread of starters including both veg and non veg! The starters included Chicken pahadi, Paneer papdi, kung pao mushroom, Dragon chicken, Haryali fish tikka, Golden fried prawns, Golden fried babycorn, chilli paneer, lahori chicken kebab and mushroom moti tikka! Starters were really good in taste! Specially the non veg and seafood starters! Chicken pahadi, a dish prepared by marinating the boneless pieces in fresh mint, coriander, ginger and garlic paste and yoghurt, had a very refreshing and delectable taste! The chicken pieces were really tender and very properly cooked! The dragon chicken was a bit spicy and juicy but really good in taste! The golden fried prawns and babycorn are prepared by marinating them in the battered paste! These are really crispy and amazingly tasty! You definitely are going to love the starters here! ‚ù§ Next they brought their famous Mandis on our table which included Mutton Juicy Marg Mandi, Grilled chicken Mandi and Fish Fried Mandi! Although all of them were good enough the one that stood apart was the Grilled Chicken Mandi! The rice in the mandi is very flavorful and yummy! And the chicken is grilled to perfection making it juicy and tender! The quantity was also ample...it can serve 4! In between all the starters and the mandis they also served us their milkshakes which had kitkat milkshake, Butterscotch milkshake and strawberry delight! Strawberry was our favourite! Made of fresh strawberries this shake gives you a refreshing taste and also You will order for another one üòâ And at the end of it all, we were served the desserts...the desserts which You commonly see in the Hyderabadi functions! They had the Qubani ka meetha, Double ka meetha, Kaddu ki kheer and Gulab Jamun! We strongly feel that they should improve on their desserts! They were just okay-ish! Dessert is the way to Man's Heart...soo it shouldn't be taken lightly! But overall it was a good experience here at Marsala, the staff was really nice and friendly and the food except for the desserts was really amazing! Do try this place...specially for their starters and the grilled chicken Mandi! üòç",5,"18 Reviews , 271 Followers",3/22/2019 19:09,7,,"{'food': ['Chicken pahadi', 'Dragon chicken', 'Golden fried prawns', 'Golden fried babycorn', 'Mutton Juicy Marg Mandi', 'Grilled chicken Mandi'], 'drink': ['Kitkat milkshake', 'Butterscotch milkshake', 'Strawberry delight']}"

The staff doesn‚Äôt know how to treat with customers they were unnecessarily speaking and poking nose in our personal conversation and behaving miserably with the people there pretending that is ‚Äúcool‚Äù behaviour.

Marsala Food Company,Tania Sahu(Mrsfoodieglobetrotter),"Went there for dinner. Tried Chicken Mandi and double ka meetha. Quantity of Mandi was good for two. Double ka meetha was average. Ambience and service was ok but could have given 4 stars if the AC could have been a little high and service a little fast. I also feel they should also take care of the taste of dishes as there are so many good competitors around.

Marsala Food Company,Karna Nair,"Today I visited this place along with a few friends.Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location.The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.The ambience is good.The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit.",5,"30 Reviews , 63 Followers",3/16/2019 22:08,27,,"{'food': ['Arabian Chicken Soup', 'Lemon Corriander Soup', 'Chicken Pahadi', 'Paneer Papdi Kebab', 'Kung Pao Mushroom', 'Dragon Chicken', 'Hariyali Fish Tikka', 'Golden Fried Prawns', 'Golden Fried Baby Corn', 'Chilli Paneer', 'Lahori Chicken Kabab', 'Mushroom Moti Tikki', 'Mushroom Mandi', 'Chicken Mandi', 'Fish Mandi'], 'drink': ['KitKat Milkshake', 'Butterscotch Milkshake', 'Strawberry Milkshake']}"

I ordered Chicken dum biryani from here, relying on their ratings but the very first experience itself was really bad. The chicken tasted horrible and was stale. I had to throw away the biryani. You guys should check the food before delivering it to the customers as delivery of this kind of food does not only affect the ratings but also can cause serious health issues. I value food which is worth the money spent and I feel betrayed here. I contacted zomato regarding the issue and they just assured me that this won't happen again and conveyed that they have shared feedback with the restaurant. They should have issued a proper refund here.

Marsala Food Company,Rakesh ( TripAnzo ),"Sharing my experience at marsala food company as soon as you enter just have a look at the the roof decor it's just amazing and when you get in further to the seating area you'll find the regular dinning tables and chairs and then you'll also find couches and tables well as this place serves Arabian food specifically for Mandi ppl some ppl prefer seating on the couches and making themselves comfortable while enjoying their meal the decor is decent and the service was also good let me start with the food review now so I had Arabian Chicken soup which was so rich and creamy next

I got my hands on their starters like

Chicken Pahadi kKebab
Chicken Banjara Kebab
Kung Pao Mushroom
Paneer Papdi Kebab
veg seekh kebab
dragon Chicken lahori Chicken kebab all the kebabs were fine what I liked the most among the starters were Kung Pao Mushroom dragon Chicken and banjara kebab and I felt that the veg seekh kebab was a bit dry and had no flavours apart from that everything was really delicious

Getting into the main course now I tried Mutton Juicy Mandi chicken Tangdi Mandi and grilled fish Mandi I personally liked chicken Tangdi Mandi as the chicken was well marinated and spicy as I love spicy food

Treating myself with the milkshakes and Desserts now in milkshakes I tried chocolate, butterscotch and KitKat I liked the KitKat one it was so deliciously topped with a scoop of ice-cream and then KitKat as a cherry on the top and in desserts I had gajar Ka Halwa double Ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer I liked kaddu ki kheer the most there was no major difference between gajar Ka Halwa and double Ka meetha my overall experience was good the staff were friendly and cooperative all I would like to say is its a good place to hangout with your friends for a proper Arabian meal !!",5,"58 Reviews , 564 Followers",3/16/2019 1:33,19,,"{'food': ['Chicken Pahadi kKebab', 'Chicken Banjara Kebab', 'Kung Pao Mushroom', 'Paneer Papdi Kebab', 'veg seekh kebab', 'dragon Chicken lahori Chicken kebab', 'banjara kebab'], 'drink': []}"

We ordered for chicken kebabs for starter which was perfectly cooked with awesome taste and after that we ordered chicken biryani which was came up with nice quality and superb taste with good enough quantity.

Marsala Food Company,Chaithanya Guptha Gollapalli,"Soups: Had tomato soup and sweet corn veg soup, both especially the tomato soup along with tiny breadsticks was delicious.

Starters: Ordered crispy corn chilli pepper and Paneer papdi kebab. Was very much disappointed with the quantity they gave. We only get 4 pieces of paneer papdi kebab. It was crispy and tasty but could've used a little more spice. The crispy corn being crispy corn tasted wonderful! 

Main Course: Ordered Paneer Tikka Biryani, and Butter Naan along with Kaju Paneer. The butter naan and the curry were decent but the paneer tikka biryani was the best paneer biryani I've ever tasted. The paneer pieces were soft and creamy and the rice had a rich taste to it. Though the biryani could've used a little more spice, it tasted great! 

Ambiance & Service: This is an evening place for sure and we visited there for lunch. So couldn't really comment on that but whatever we could see looked very good. One complaint was that our seats were directly beside a bare glass and we got scorched in the sun for 40 mins before we could get a table away from it. Avoid the seats beside the glass during afternoon hours. The service was a little late but the staff was friendly. Kudos to that!

Marsala Food Company,Vinay,"I gotta tell you this is the best place in gachibowli with a pocket friendly collection. Went here for lunch and unfortunately some part of this store is not really having shades which resulted in sunlight falling on us while lunch. Did not feel comfortable while seating there, later we moved on to different table.

        Ambiance pretty normal not so catchy but i would say evenings are the best time to visit this place. Service is good, quite descent number of servers. Impressed with their work polite, calm and patient. having enough said about the service and ambiance let's skip into the food!

Veg corn soup: Touch of the sweet corn along with the hot sour soup, the veg soup tasted extremely well.

Tomato : Crispy bread crums soaked in the sweet tomato soup gives you a mouth watering feeling right when it gets to your table.

chicken soup: I would say this is the best chicken soup i ever had. Minced chicken along with the soup can give you the best taste.

Mutton shorba: Well, this is also a mouth watering dish over here, loved the taste of shorba. The hot soup served with the piece of mutton, can really make your day!!

  
Crispy Corn : Spicy enough as well as crispy enough this starter really gave us a boost! 

Chicken Spring Roll: This is where i was pretty disappointed because they failed to impress us. not really tasty though. 

Loose Prawns : Neatly washed and perfectly grilled the loose prawns were delicious resulting in craving for more.

Chicken Chettinad : well cooked well marinated with enough spices the chettinad curry really satisfied our need. 

chicken mughlai : Spicy enough, delicious enough just satisfying the need for spicy indian food, this dish never dissapoints you. 

Panner Biryani : wasn't really impressed with panner biryani though, it could do better. 

chicken Biryani: Since i am not a fan of cardamom the usage of cardamom in biryani makes me go crazy but this place and moderately put up cardamom in biryani adding it a slight flavour. I suggest it's better to ask before preparing the food.

Club Rogue,Neha Choudhary,"Whole club is a friendly place for smokers which becomes a problem for people who don't smoke.

I went to this club with my friends around 8. It was fine then but slowly the suffocation started. There is no proper ventilation, guessing based on the experience I had. Whichever club, I have been to, there is a separate outdoor place dedicated for smoking. The restaurant or a pub or a club will have outdoor dinning area to address this issue. But here at this place, i couldn't see an open window. It was all dark! I think they really took ""Rogue"" word to another level.
I couldn't enjoy at all, came from there when it was too much for me, now i have got this itching in my throat and cold just because of all that cigarette smoke.

Club Rogue,Sravanthi Kumsi,"Been to Club Rogue last Saturday I.e. 13th April 2019. We chose this place as it was a Bollywood night. Lot of things to get told about this place.
First, coming to the ambience. It's a nice big place. The pricing is reasonable. We were given a place of our liking after a little followup.
Now coming to the attitude & rules of the club. The entrance has a prominent display which says, only couple allowed in after 7pm. Easily 10 bounces at the entrance, but inside- NIL! In spite of the display board saying only couples, they have allowed stags in. The dance floor was unchecked. Anyone could dance, feel you or ogle at you and not one single staff to monitor anything.
The Bollywood songs started at 11.10pm! I don't know what were they waiting for till so late to start playing Bollywood music.
Overall, a nice place but definitely enter this place with caution & at your risk & evaluate your need to visit this place.

Club Rogue,Santosh Kumar Kabra,"Recently been to this place. Good food and economically priced. Service was also good.
Most disappointing part is their crowd management. When they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. No bouncers to check what is going on floor. Stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. Just for their business they r letting everyone in.
I will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. As there is no security for them. One should enjoy the party but with some limits.
The management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a Rouge place. Lot of cheap crowd on Saturday night better to avoid.",2,"1 Review , 22 Followers",4/15/2019 13:47,0,,"{'food': ['Good food'], 'drink': []}"

Really bad service.

This place has a quiet weird rule. If you show your office ID card they‚Äôll not be charging a cover amount. Else you‚Äôll have to pay a cover charge.

The bar attenders are so ill mannered, I was almost about to slap one.
If you can‚Äôt talk to a customer politely, then maybe you should not work at a bar!
I‚Äôve asked for a Budweiser but he gave me a kingfisher and then insisted that I ordered kingfisher. (I‚Äôm okay with the argument part but he said drink it or get out which made me furious).

Food was average and served medium hot (I think I was served someone else‚Äôs cancelled order item)

Music was terrible! There was some desi dj who was playing songs out of YouTube and there was no quality mixing.

This is for the manager who was outside at the gate. 23rd March, 2019. We were three friends, and the bouncer at the gate asked for company ID, as we were stags. One of my friend called another, who was on the way, whether he was carrying his ID proof.
In the mean time that Manager appeared at the gate.
We went to the gate and showed the ID, but he looked at us head to toe, and made a disgusting face and asked for 2k cover charge. Without any reason.
Some other stag groups were entering; just showing company ID.
But this manager asked 2k cover charge from us, and we saw, he did same with another three guys group.
We didn‚Äôt make any nuisance there, and silently left the place.

The service was the worst.. All of my friends went to the dance floor and I was stopped by the staff who asked not to leave the table and asked me to deposit my id card. This was pretty humiliating. This place probably sees too many dine & dash incidents given the kind of crowd it caters to.
The food was average at best.

Club Rogue,Sheetal Adapa,"I am thinking where to start, there were so many bad experiences at this place in just 2-3 hours of time we spent there. We were a group of 8, we decided upon this place after looking at the reviews and on recommendation of someone who had visited a few months before us.
To start with, the place does not have well groomed and professional staff, they hardly understand what you speak.
The first bad experience was when we entered and got ourselves seated on a large table meant for 10, we were 6 at that time and 2 more expected to join us. As soon as we got seated, a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people, we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly, but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming, it was not even 6 PM then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us. We told him that incase more crowd comes we will move.
Secondly, we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses, when we asked for glass ones the waiter they don't have any. We had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly.
The service was slow, we had to keep looking for waiters.
We were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 PM, but the waiters stopped taking orders at 6.50 PM saying by they serve it would cross 7 PM. Doesn't that sound ridiculous?
Again they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones, when the argument was not stopping I suggested my friends that we should go to 10D, to which the waiter present said we should go to 10D they use glass tumblers, after he said that we demanded meeting the Manager.
The Manager came and he was a nightmare, he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us, when we said we will give bad rating/ review the Manager said ""Ok Sir, we are also dangerous people"" we were shocked at this.
Our evening was spoilt already, so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere.
This place is not at all professional, the staff and their business ethics are horrible, will never visit ever.",1,"24 Reviews , 43 Followers",2/19/2019 15:59,0,,"{'food': [], 'drink': []}"

The place is overcrowded during weekends and there is no proper crowd management of any sort. Then the waiters say that because it is overcrowded, orders can't be processed properly. Despite all that inconvenience and bad service, they force you for paying the tip and even argue over how much you want to pay. Crowd is very indecent and sometimes vulgar and there is no provision for crowd control given that the place is overcrowded. Music and DJ is good with cheap food and drinks, which is a crowd puller.

Food : decently priced, huge helpings. One dish likely to suffice for two. Unless, of course... ;)
Drinks : large+ rum and hot water punched with lemon and spice for under 200. What else could one ask for? Unless, one finds better pleasure in other drinks... ;) Beer bucket prices ~900. So... Yeah good place to get the buzz.
Dance : the heart and soul of the place. DJs do a great job, generally. It's EDM untill 10pm-ish, and right mix of Punjabi, Bollywood and popular English. If you come here 2-3 days you'll figure out the pattern of songs the DJ plays. But every other day, he/she does surprise you.

Fridays and Saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor. Couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table... (Just saying)

When we were placing orders at 6:50pm, they said, it wasn't counted under happy hours. No explanation given. Shady ambience and very diluted drinks Food was OK. The worst part is that they were serving the drinks in plastic glasses, real shabby ones. We asked for proper glasses and they told us to go to 10D.. I mean.. Really?? Asking 9 customers to get lost?? We were unhappy with the server's response, and wanted to talk to the manager, who was even worse.

What surprised me the most was that they were serving everything in plastic glasses? Like seriously? Serve drinks in a plastic glass? When speaking to the waiter he said - go to 10D they serve drinks in glasses and not plastic, it was so rude for him to say that. I asked him to call his manager and told him the story to which he says his boss asked to serve in plastic glasses and kept explaining that it was his boss's order, he was just not able to understand what I was explaining to him - I bigger issue was about the way the waiter had spoken to me and when even after sometime I realised he was not interested in what I was saying, I was furious and used F word to which he said you can use F word but we are also very dangerous people? Like what dangerous? He was absolutely okay with me writing this review as they felt they didn't have any obligation towards customer service. It was not something they were giving me for free and to compensate he was willing to give me discount and also call the waiter to apologies to me - I didn't need someone's apology - what matters the most is their service and looks like it does not appear anywhere on their list of how to sustain in the business.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Priyanka Naidu,"This review has been long overdue and i have finally managed to get some time out to do so.

So 4 of us visited Mazzo on the 14th of Feb and chose the Veg & Non-Veg options accordingly from their menu, pre-decided. At 2500 INR plus taxes per head we expected the basics, quality service & excellent food.

Imagine our shock when we received exactly the opposite. 

1. The linen on the table we were seated at had cigarette holes in it. 
2. The livery was stained.
3. The restaurant hadn't set up yet even though it was 2130 hrs by the time we arrived.
4. Instead of being given comfortable seating, we were given plastic chairs with white wraps on them.
5. The Cream of Asparagus soup was like toilet water. So was the Avocado Chicken Corn Chowder Soup. They refused to give us extra croutons because we've already eaten too many. What else is one supposed to do when you are served such bad tasting soup?
6. The Bharwab Subz Kebab was dry like dried meat, the Grilled Buffalo Chicken was terrible smelling only - How to eat?, the Lamb Galouti was decent and the Vegetable Lumpia was oily and tiny. - All in All the appetizers were equally useless.
7. Moving onto the Main course now - For the Vegetarian Me, i was given a choice between the Anjeer Kesar Kofte and Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli. I obviously chose the latter D-uh. Big Mistake. When i asked the server why the ravioli was so dry, i was told that the halogen lamp made it so. Then why keep it under the lamp for so long? And the former you ask, it was so sweet, it was like drinking Chaasni - the sugar water from the Rasgulla or Gulab Jamun dabba.
8. Not like the Non-Vegetarians had it any better. 6 Hours Braised Lamb Shank OR Nalli Nihari OR Murgh Methi. 
Lamb - It was more bones than lamb and also, baby lamb Such a tiny piece that my husband had to eat another dinner after we got home.
Nalli Nihari - More like Nal ka Paani. No taste no Nihari.
Murgh Methi - WhyWhyWhy so many bones in a dosh which one assumes is boneless and that too in a 5 star hotel. Roti you ask? - Please DO NOT.
9. And last but not the least, Dessert.
Vanilla Bean Pannacotta - I make better Pannacotta and i just wanted to cry. The coulis was just sugar water with some red colouring.
Kesar Malai Kulfi - This was bought from Scoops. The server told us also. The only thing on the menu that tasted fantastic.

On the 13tb floor next to pool having drinks and food with your close friends was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this place to all. Food was very tasty and filling. After ages I must have had so tasty and upto the mark Rogan Ghosh. I would be visiting again with my wife to this place and would like to spend some quality time. The only 1 part I would suggest as improvement will be the wait area for giving the order and receiving the food on the table...rest it was a beautiful experience.,5,"5 Reviews , 23 Followers",5/6/2019 18:06,3,,"{'food': ['Rogan Ghosh'], 'drink': []}"

It is ultimate place if you want to have romantic date with your loved one at poolside.. Basically this is rooftop place with outdoor seating arrangement on poolside with live IPL and indoor seating arrangement with some light music.loved their ambiance..

My review is based on session invite..

Soup - coconut Thai soup which was amazing..It has creamy consistency and that coconut flavor and Thai spices were enhancing it's taste to the next level..

In starter, We tried beetroot paneer Tikka which was damn good..Paneer was marinated in beetroot gravy and they barbeque it and served it with green chutney .Taste wise it was good..

Sikampuri kebab - This was show stealer dish of the day..It was stuffed with many ingredients like casher,potato, capsicum,green peas, onion, khoya, kismis and the list goes on..It was luscious..MUST TRY

Mocktails,
Mango mint - It was one of the show stealer Mocktail..The hint of mint and mango flavor was refreshing...

Apple cooler - it was sundowner Mocktail..Very refreshing..Apple chunks and mint leaves were giving fresh punch to the drink.

In main course,

Stuffed capsicum - This is one of my favorite dish from childhood but trust me nobody can beat this taste.. .. Capsicum was cooked and soft enough from outside and the consistency of stuffing was adequate.. Loved it and I would like to day plating was damn attractive..

Malai kofta - lt was presented in a big pate with small modak shape kofta with creamy and luscious gravy..Kofta was stuffed with paneer, khoya and some spices and to balance the taste gravy was little son sweet side..It lip smacking good..

In Desserts we tried hot brownie with vanilla ice cream. brownie was soft enough and sweetness was balanced..It was heavenly good .

My overall experience was amazing..chef Bhuvnesh was helpful us through out our dinning time.Mr.Nitin made our dinning experiences comfortable and memorable... I would like to mention that every staff member was so friendly and helpful too... Loved their hospitality..

I would definitely recommend this place to have a one of the best experience with food and Ambiance..",5,"151 Reviews , 2116 Followers",5/1/2019 15:44,7,,"{'food': ['beetroot paneer Tikka', 'stuffed capsicum', 'malai kofta'], 'drink': ['mango mint', 'apple cooler']}"

Looking for a romantic dinner? I would say this is one of the best place in Hyderabad. Amazing ambience along the poolside. My review is based on the session invite.

We started our dinner with Thai coconut soup. Perfectly cooked veggies like carrot, broccoli, zucchini dipped into the coconut milk. It was very tasty.

In starters, we were served Beetroot paneer Tikka and Sikampuri kebab. Plating was very tempting. Paneer Tikka goes really well with the chutney they served with it. And the kebab, it was the best Sikampuri kebab I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and moist inside.

In mocktails, they suggested their best sellers which were apple cooler and minty mango. Apple cooler was little tangy and minty mango was on sweeter side. I just loved the latter one. It was very refreshing.

Then comes the main course. We had Malai kofta - modak shaped kofta layered with cashew curry. Sweetness was balanced and delicious in taste. Must try with their herb paratha. We also had Stuffed capsicum - one of the famous and ultimate dish in India. If you have only curry, you may find it salty, but have it with capsicum and you will feel it like a heaven.

In dessert, I had brownie with vanilla ice cream. Brownie was nice, soft, crispy outside and moist inside.

Overall, my experience was amazing with Mazzo. Bhuvnesh - the main chef is very humble person and his suggestions were really helpful while having a dinner. I also enjoyed the service from their courteous staff.",5,"100 Reviews , 1224 Followers",4/27/2019 14:50,10,,"{'food': ['Thai coconut soup', 'Beetroot paneer Tikka', 'Sikampuri kebab', 'Malai kofta', 'Stuffed capsicum', 'Brownie'], 'drink': ['Apple cooler', 'Minty mango', 'Vanilla ice cream']}"

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Akshay Krishna,"As the name suggests, its supposed to be a Marriott and that's what you expect. The reality is very different.

Let's start with my experience even before reaching. I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool. And so I did.
I was denied reservation saying that it's really ""full"" but they finally said they can get me one table. I was happy.

It has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it's own parking and valet which is real comfortable.
Now let's talk real business.

Upon Reaching I see the place completely empty. Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty. I didn't understand why they had to do play so hard to get. Even by the time we left, the place was hardly even half full. The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside.

Ambience : the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest. It's very mediocre.

Staff: THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them. I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come. There is an inside seating and outside, we took the inside because it was too noisy out.

I asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me ""Andar koi nahi baithta"" (No one sits inside)
If you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open?

There was a buffet and we went for it, now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there. We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them, they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to.

Being a Marriott, you'd expect some decent service they said if I'm paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there. Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel.

Food: There was hair in the food. Starters were okay but main course was very bad. And let me make special note of the dessert.

If I'm coming for a buffet in such a place, I'd expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop. They bought kaaju kathli, Rasgulla, Some barfi among some cake etc. And no spoons to take them, had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert.

Next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view. I've attached pictures

After paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went. When we tried to Express our grief, that waiter/manager just blatantly shut me off. I'm not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place.

It was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad. Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property. I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here.",1,"144 Reviews , 911 Followers",4/10/2019 12:31,2,,"{'food': ['hair in the food', 'main course was very bad'], 'drink': []}"

An hour later a guy comes and tells us to leave because they‚Äôve reservations. I informed him that we made a reservation too but they denied to let us continue. However, we all agreed to leave and asked for bill. Here is the twist, the bill comes 30 mins later and there was no one to collect cash/card from us. They made us wait for more than 1.5 hours and all this while, no table was occupied. It was all EMPTY!

Visited this place for a rather late lunch, say somewhere around 3/4.

Ambience - Simply classic and sufficiently spacious (at least,we felt so because we were the only customers in the restaurant.) This place reeks of class & elegance from the moment you step inside the elevator. The place is brightly lit and relaxing. Though the rooftop view is breathtaking coupled with sitting by the poolside, we preferred sitting indoors.

Service - Gopal was our server for the day. Courteous and meticulous, he helped us with suggestions for dishes more suitable for our tastes. The staff overall seemed to be attentive and polite.

Food - We ordered two drinks(I can't recollect the names, sorry for that) and they arrived promptly at our table within no time. Ordered Caprese Bruschetta and Creamy Pesto Penne Pasta.
I've tried Bruschetta at other places but never savoured it the way I did here. The freshness of toppings was evident. The pasta was sufficient for two and that again, was a delight to eat. Had to rush,hence couldn't try the desserts.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Debangana Tarafdar,"Mazzo, located on top of SLN Terminus, is the dining wing, for Marriott‚Äôs modern extended-stay apartment hotel.
Marriott is known for it‚Äôs hospitality, and you will experience that, here at Mazzo.

I went to Mazzo, for lunch on a sultry afternoon. The view by the pool was spectacular, and breathtaking.
I could totally see, how this can be the most perfect date place.

I had a continental meal, and boy was it amazing! I had a few dishes out of the menu, and complements to the chef, Amit, for getting everything so right.

I had Indian Shorba and Fish n Chips for starters; Pork Chops and Spaghetti Carbonara for my main course; and a Brownie with icecream for desert.

Every dish was fantastic. But the Fish n Chips and Pork Chops blew my mind.

The fish was delicious, and the batter was perfect.

The Pork Chops were extremely juicy, and cooked to perfection. The mashed potato was oh so buttery and dreamy. And, how can I forget that demi-glace sauce. Beautiful!

The spaghetti carbonara with bacon was love.

Plating was just so Marriot! Elegant yet simple.

And, all of this, while sitting in one of the most beautiful places in the city.

A heartfelt thank you to the team at Mazzo, for putting together such a beautiful meal.",5,"117 Reviews , 980 Followers",2/27/2019 23:31,8,,"{'food': ['Indian Shorba', 'Fish n Chips', 'Pork Chops', 'Spaghetti Carbonara', 'Brownie with icecream'], 'drink': []}"

We had made the night special and Marriott in turn surprised us with their lip smacking dishes too. We had our hands on few cocktails namely Eye of the tiger and Bull frog which kept the mood flowing for the night.
The Chicken and Thyme pasta that night was absolutely delicious as the cheese has melted really well as could really enjoy the real taste. Hands on this was the best compared to any pasta I tried in restaurants at Hyderabad. Absolutely wonderful.
Wok tossed Hakka noodles too surprised as it lived upto the name of why it‚Äôs called a Hakka. It purely means an explosion of different flavours in a noodles and it really was. At above ‚Çπ400 both dishes really is worth the money further considering the hospitality and the ambience of the hotel.

The Macrail and pork were the best starters of the lot. Chef Aritra was courteous enough to come and check for the taste of food. He also ensured that my son gets to taste the non spicy foods such as Japanese noodles and Murtabak. The cocktails served were also as per expectation.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Susmitha Yenugula,"I will start off with what impressed me the most and go from there:

Service (5/5)
I worked with Nitin to host a wedding shower for my sister and brother in law, with a guest list of 30 people. Nitin was so easy to talk to and tried his best to accommodate all my requests. His staff was very courteous and even helped me when the decor team came to setup. At the party, they were attentive to all my guests and followed instructions well. Nitin even provided me with a speaker so I could play songs during the party. There are a lot of things that could stress someone out when hosting a party, but the location and the staff were not on that list. It is a genuine relief that I had Nitin and his team to help me.

Ambience (5/5)
The location is PERFECT if you want to host a party, take someone out on a date or just relax with your friends on a Friday evening after work. Good aesthetics along with attention to detail makes this place what it is - the rooftop, the pool, the bar, the lounge chairs by the pool, the lighting at night, the city views. 

Food (4/5)
I created the food and drinks menu for my guests with help from Nitin. Mazzo has a HUGE menu you can choose from if you're hosting a party. I for one was confused with all the choices but Nitin's suggestions were well received. Appetizers were amazing and main course was pretty good. They even have the option of live stations - pasta, Mongolian, chaat etc. Overall, diverse options.",5,"1 Review , 1 Follower",2/20/2019 2:46,0,,"{'food': ['appetizers', 'main course', 'live stations'], 'drink': []}"

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sidhant Dhirsamant,"Revised Review:

It was an absolute delight to be at Mazzo. The view is something worth looking forward to. It‚Äôs probably among the best views at a restaurant that you can get in Hyderabad. After a not so pleasant first encounter, I decided to give it another attempt. And boy, this time, it was definitely worth.

We were welcomed warmly and the chef greeted us and carefully noted our preferences in food and taste. Soon after we were served with Fried Papad to nibble on and Cranberry Base Mocktail to give some company. The poolside table with that view is sure to make your evening.

A little later, the Hot and sour soup arrived. It was a tad bit spicy but it sure opened up all the taste senses to enjoy the dishes coming in later. For starters, we had Veg Manchurian and Paneer 65 served with the green chutney dip. The Veg Manchurian was a little more spicy, but tasted good anyway. And the Paneer 65 was absolute perfection, with the soft Paneer cooked in real balanced masala.

We, then got in Veg Lasagne and Veg Biryani for main course. The lasagne was cooked very differently from the ones that I had earlier. This had a very different taste, I‚Äôm not comparing in terms of better or worse, just a very different taste. And it was a delight not just to the taste buds but also to the eyes *winks*. The Biryani, as usual, was good. Accompanied with this was the Apple mint mojito which left a tingling sweet taste every time I had a sip.

The best was saved for the last. Although, we were full to the brim, I couldn‚Äôt leave the beautiful Rasmalai untouched. And of course, there‚Äôs always a separate stomach for desserts, so. 

Overall, I had a lovely evening with my sister, that day. And I recommend it for dates or business dinners, maybe even hangout with a friend or two, you‚Äôd have a sublime time, regardless of who you‚Äôre with.

Old Review:

Overall Rating - 3/5

Such a serene ambience, if only it was accompanied by some good food. Me and my sister dropped by this place one evening. I was struck with the beautiful view this place has at nights. We asked for the menu, a couple times, after which we finally got it. The menu has limited options and if you are looking for vegetarian items (like me), you hardly have a choice. We ordered in a Subz Shammi Kebab to start with. The staff took their own sweet time to serve it, but it was toothsome, which compensated for the delayed service (I guess). Due to lack of options for drinks, we settled for a Salted Lassi and a Hot Chocolate. I don't want to go into much depth, but well, they weren't great. Both the drinks had thin consistency. We then went ahead with the Vegetable Biryani, it was definitely appetizing along with the salan and the raita, but the quantity was less. 

I'm not sure if the poor service was because it was late when we arrived or some other reason. But, to be perfectly candid, I don't think I would spend the amount just to have a good view with standard food. Definitely, not worthy enough.",5,"137 Reviews , 813 Followers",1/14/2019 15:17,8,,"{'food': ['Subz Shammi Kebab', 'Vegetable Biryani', 'Salan', 'Raita'], 'drink': ['Salted Lassi', 'Hot Chocolate']}"

They checked with us every 20 minutes to make sure we had a good time and TASTY food. Lastly they bought a cake for my wife to celebrate her birthday.

Food : 3.5/5 The starters were just OK, main course was a little better. For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case. What disappointed most was the drinks, even a classic margarita was not properly made. It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK. 

Ambiance : 5/5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance. Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome. One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants.

Service : 2/5 This is where it is most disappointing, you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you. And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive. Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city.

Price :  3/5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants. But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved.

Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Furious Abbadi,"Green bawarchi is a most familiar restaurant in Hyderabad. They spread over Hyderabad. You will find any green bawarchi near your area.

Coming to this like all green bawarchi restaurants, they have crowd for taken away customers. We had take many times.

Coming to dine here. It's like any normal restaurant with basic interiors. We have to wait 25-30mins after order something. We had grilled chicken, butter chicken, butter naan, rumali roti and chicken biryani. I like their chutney which comes with chicken. Biryani was nice but little spicy. Roti and butter naan both were fine.

Pocket friendly. We can go with family and friends.

Two people could share it easily. The taste was first class. I for one can handle briyani as much as you think, but I was stunned.

Food here was good, only hoping for better choices.
I understand that providing buffet becomes a tedious task when everything has to be covered up under one roof so not complaining much.
Ambience wise the place doesn't have much to offer. But the staff was the sweetest.
There was this lady whose name I can't recall but she when I asked if I can get some gulab jamuns even after it was over, she made them especially for me and delivered on table.
That gesture made me like the restaurant better.

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,The Greedy Hippo,"This outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the Kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd.

The ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space. It was well lit but could really deck up a few notches. It was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant.

Upon arrival, were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation. We were asked if we are here for buffet. The restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet. I had a look at the menu and it didn't interest me.

The manager at this place was a nice fellow. Who carefully took our order of dragon chicken, punjabi chicken curry, and garlic naan. After a fair bit of waiting time, we're served with dragon chicken.

I would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry, so that the flavours stick to the chicken. It was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation.

The servers need to be taught a little bit about serving. They were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers.

Then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan. Simply put, it was a disaster. The curry was as bland as it could be. Most restaurants in this part of India assume that all dishes of Punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief. We could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own. It was just sitting there doing nothing. Neither it was spicy, not it was tangy. It was going nowhere.

The problem here doesn't lie with the chefs. It lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do. They say they are multi cuisine, but multi cuisine doesn't mean, you can make disaster dishes and pass them off. I am not a fan of multi cuisine. When you have such a title, you should at least try to make it work for you. The restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant North Indian population or the traditional South Indian population.

One thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their Buffet menu. They tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion.

Had the restaurant, been a traditional southern one, I would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content.

The restaurant needs to find its footing. The owners need to decide which way they want to go. Maybe hire some traditional North Indian guys for North cuisine.

While going healthy and done with enough of biryanis it was time for Ragi muda. Ordered one ragi muda, the quantity was good, properly boiled and happy to satisfy me. Have gone with many orders from this place.

Also visited their restaurant in madhapur branch and must say am very happy with the service, food and ambiance.

They have given it a old town look. Butter and Tandoori naan were amazing with the butavankay curry thick and 3 pieces of brinjal in it. Little spicy but absolutely homely food is what i can say about this place.

The Glass Onion,Arjun,"The Glass Onion is located at a calm and a quiet place. Despite being around a km behind Infosys, the place gives it an advantage of switching away from city chaos and you needn't be bothered about finding a place for parking. While the restaurant does offer valet, but the parking area next to the restaurant is huge and you can easily get a place there.

Once you enter the restaurant you're floored by the grandness of the place as it comes as something unexpected. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Owing to the summers, we opted for indoor seating. The tables are well spaced and there's enough distance between the adjacent tables to give you a premium experience.

The servers are well groomed, attentive and make good recommendations basis the specialities of the restaurant and after checking your preference. For starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti Kebab and Nachos. The Kebabs were well cooked and though a little spicy left a good after taste. The Nachos were light, crispy and had good amount of toppings. Despite Nachos being one of the common starters, I'd still recommend people to try the ones here.

For the main course we ordered the Lahori Paneer Combo that gets served with a small bowl of Dal Makhni and Naan/Pulao. The Paneer too tasted very good and had the right amount of spices which blended well with the Paneer. The Dal Makhni that came along with the Paneer was out of this world. It's a pity that it doesn't get served separately, but upon request the servers certainly obliged by offering another small bowl of the same. For something that's prepared so well, I feel that the patrons should get to taste more of it and would request the management of the restaurant to include it in their menu.

Finally the dessert. Tiramisu pastry. Simply no words. Right amount of sweetness, well blended flavour and that smooth after taste of coffee. After a good dinner, the Tiramisu sealed the deal for us to be one completely satisfied customers.

One small observation that I'd still like to add is that despite a good number of servers, they tend to get distracted and slightly inefficient when all the tables start getting full. Towards the end we had to remind them about the dessert and it was evident that they had missed bringing it. However considering that they were attentive and friendly for most of our time there, I wouldn't penalize the restaurant with a star but would request to keep a check on the observation and continue to maintain the quality of the food to keep ensuring repeat visits.",5,"266 Reviews , 1559 Followers",5/12/2019 18:36,7,,"{'food': ['Lotus Stem Galouti Kebab', 'Lahori Paneer Combo', 'Dal Makhni'], 'drink': []}"

The Glass Onion,The Hungry Turtle,"This place looks really nice with some good music. They have both outdoor and indoor seating facility and it's a best place to hangout with the family and friends. Outdoor seating has an amazing view of the Golf ground and can be enjoyed during evening.

They welcomed us with a welcome drink which was really nice.
First we ordered Screw Driver, Tropical Delight and Mint Cooler which was really good.

Screw Driver - It was a Cocktail which contains Vodka and Orange juice.

Tropical Delight - It had Orange, Pineapple, Mango and cream which taste differently. I personally liked that blend but my friends didn't. I would rate 3.8/5.

Mint Cooler - It is just normal Virgin Mojito what we gets in other places as well. Nothing special was not their. 3.5/5

For Starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti which was ok ok. The kulcha was bit hard so that we need to chew it more. 3.4/5

Next we ordered BBQ Roasted Chicken pizza which was good. The pizza was properly cooked but bit burned at the end which can happen. But that was covered by the taste. 4/5

Overall the experience was really good and it is located in a calm area where we can sit and enjoy with our kids or family or friends.

And when we asked them to pack some of the remaining food, they didn't seem too happy about it. The appetizers and soup were good, but the quantity was too little. We ordered the ""Classic Mezeh Platter"" and when asked for some pita bread, the waiters frowned upon us and did not give us an appropriate response.

Ambience was really good. We had experience of both indoor and outdoor dining. Outdoor dining truly outscored indoor experience.

Food was good but a bit higher on the price looking at portion size. We ordered Mediterranean platter, Bruschetta for vegetarians. The mocktails were nice.

It was couple of days before elections and apparently alcohol was not to be served. What really impressed me was that they followed rules. That's really good to see.

For main course we ordered a north indian combo, a very customised pasta and couple more things. They tasted good. Deserts were good but served delayed.

The Glass Onion,Jay Mehta,"2 stars for the place for rest 3, need good food, service, presentation and experience

Lets start with the good part for which the two stars.

Ambience , location and the place is amazing nothing like other places in hyd. The rain today made it even better. Outdoor has this chil lounge vibe with good house music and indoor being this good energy family or dinner vibe.

Thats it to the place and good part!

Service was bad, food was ok. If a restaurant does not serve filter water it is a huge problem. Buying water is a choice not force. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are local udipi or a five star. We were told we dont have filter water something is broken so you buy. While leaving we did see other tables served normal water.

We did have zomato gold to use, but the experience was not so great to use it. First turnoff , dont have kingfisher beers.

We ordered veg tandoor platter, margherita pizza , tiramisu and cheesecake.

Pizza was the best part and yet i would say a 3.5/5. Generous amount of sauce and cheese but 3 basil leaf to count. We asked for mustard and denied.

The platter had many things but of of which was paneer tikka n no grilled onion or peppers or tomato. Whole platter didnt come with any onion et al side. Extra chutney took forever to come.

Tiramisu was average will not try again or recommend

Cheesecake was pretty bad. Packed to throw i guess. The blueberry on it ...is red color which is super confusing. The creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard.

They gave a birthday brownie, Which frankly was average too. However, the server comes and tells me during payment, i have not charged you for brownie. WTF!!!!!

Overall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks. Hop to jonathans for food or some place in indiranagar.",2,"46 Reviews , 43 Followers",5/11/2019 22:12,6,,"{'food': ['veg tandoor platter', 'margherita pizza', 'tiramisu', 'cheesecake'], 'drink': ['zomato gold']}"

About food, quality of food is good, but waiters need to be taught that when four people order two different dishes, all those to be served at same time. What happens was, we two finished out veg food and the nob veg waa not even delivered when we finished our veg food.

We ordered Lotus stem Galouti, the taste of Galouti was good, but keeping one small kulcha was not going well. I know it must be an experiment, but I guess it is not working out as it was not going well with Galouti.

The New York cheesecake (with blueberry sauce) was good, but I won't deny that I have tasted better cheesecakes before. We ordered one pizza which, was quite filling and with generous amount of smoked and mozzarella cheese was enough for two. Special shoutout to the manager and the head waiter (I apologize I don't remember his name, but he definitely needs some appreciation. I remember he said he was from Delhi and also Kolkata) who was very courteous and offered us a complementary dessert. This definitely made our night because it tasted so good.

The Glass Onion,Gautam,"We visited the restaurant yesterday. We got outside table as all insides were reserved. Being 42 degrees outside, they only had fans running in such upscale restaurant and mist fans. They are charging 1400 RS for buffet and is considered upscale restaurant. Quite amazed on how upscale restaurants cannot afford coolers. Felt bad for waiters also as they were fully sweating and running around..I had same experience few months back. We went in th evening and it rained. We took the outside seating due to nice weather plus all the water was gushing inside and they had nothing to prevent that.

The main course was a custom made ravioli pasta in mixed sauce which was very good and a stir fry veg Udon noodles.

They can improve on service a bit as no one bothered to serve us food..not even first time!

The Glass Onion,Amlan Jena,"I will start off by talking about it's ambience and location which I believe (and am sure most will agree) are it's highlights. Located inside the serenity of Boulder hills ,away from the hullabaloo of the busy city ,it offers a sense of calm. The simple yet elegant decor , is what clicked for me right from the moment I walked in. It has both and indoor and outdoor sitting. The indoor sitting though comfortable and well lit, I would suggest the outdoor one simply because of the view it has to offer. The streches of green pasture of the golf club adjacent to it and the mild breeze that blows across it , definitely refreshes your soul as you sit sipping on your drink. I visited it on a summer evening and it was a pleasant experience to say the least. Now coming to the food and beverages part, definitely a little on the bulkier side but you got to expect that from a place like this located in the midst of all VIP locality . The cocktails are good and do ask the waiter for in house food specialities which may not be mentioned in the menu. And yes they have a novel concept of High tea served along with alcoholic beverages , which is served during the early hours of the evening (4-7 pm) , with the set up they have I believe this is a must try. Overall it's a nice place to spend a quiet afternoon or evening , with family or friends.

This was my dinner night with Naina at Glass Onion, a beautiful restaurant at Boulder Hills, Hyderabad. The best thing is definitely the vast lush green golf course which gives joy and you are definitely chilling out at the finest properties in Hyderabad.
.
Let‚Äôs take the food starting right off with beer battered fish and pizza it was all perfection at affordable rates. The beer battered fish was soft and finely fried. Lovely textures I must tell. Pizza was thin crusted and we chose a veggie pizza, called Four Cheese Pizza! Yea as you wonder it has all the right mix of different types of cheese and we just loved it. A classic wood fired pizza flocks!!
.
The penne had an attractive aroma when it reached our tables, and I must say I forgot to even take a better picture before we start digging in. It was delicious and completely uplifted the mood. We surely had our drinks to give us great company and must tell ya, the Stallion a whiskey based cocktail made with passion fruit, lemon juice and grapes were simply fantastic. Make sure to use your Zomato gold in good use here.
.
The cherry on top was Apple pie our parting order, such a warm dessert served with delicious custard sauce, almond praline topped of with vanilla flavoured icecream. We surely enjoyed this dinner and this place is a great find for couples to have a romantic dinner.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating at this place. We chose to sit outside as it got a beautiful view and it was just amazing with the view and the weather.

There is quite a large selection of food from Italian, continental to Indian. We ordered for some starters from which we really like Bakchoy fry and also Malai Broccoli, chilli potato and Red chilli chicken were really nice and if you like to have some soup I would definitely suggest hi for Broccoli soup. For the Main course we ordered some White sauce pasta, Grilled chicken with Lemon Butter Garlic Sauce, Vegetarian Fried rice and my favorite Pork Spare Ribs which was just Scrumptious and beautifully cooked pork. We also ordered a cheese platter with wine and I would suggest this for the people who love to enjoy and cheese and wine.

We had less food and lot of alcohol but people who are going only to eat some food it‚Äôs really not that expensive and it‚Äôs totally worth it for the view and for the food.

The place was well lit, with a posh ambience, perfect seating and tranquil yet charming environment. Really loved the idea of the hanging plants amidst the lights.
We ordered Lotus stem galauti kebab, kung paw chicken, teriyaki mushroom. The starters were delicious especially the chicken. Beware of the cocktail as you might be in for some surprises.
Ordered stir fried udon Noodles for main course. Although a bit oily, it was tasty, full of vegetables ! The dark brownie ordered as desert was mouth watering, the taste lingers.

The Glass Onion,Aditya ReDdy,"It was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place. I reserved a table for us on the same day itself. To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.

The Glass Onion,Hungry Soul,"Vegetarian Review ~

Hopped in on a day before Holi for dinner and unfortunately it was a dry day. Survived with food that day. It's on the road to isb and is spread on a huge area with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements while is outdoor has the view of the golf course and if the weather is great, this is the best place to be. Light music playing through the night was soothing.

We ordered lotus stem galouti with cheese kulcha, Korean waffle fries, veg penne Alfredo pasta and apple pie.

Lotus stem galouti - The galouti tasted great with the flavours of Vegetables and didn't taste much of lotus stem and went well with green chutney and cheese kulcha.

Waffle fries - The waffle had lot of honey, sesame and soy and garlic with a burnt taste. The waffle wasn't crispy and the didn't wasn't that great for my taste buds.

Alfredo pasta - The pasta was creamy and had all the veggies, the consistency was good and it tasted well overall.

Apple pie - This was star of the night for me with the pie tasted great with the falvours of apple and cardamom and the icecream was cheery on the cake and the whole dessert was mouth watering and heart filling.

The staff is good and friendly, I remember being the last one to exit and they were still nice. Keep up the good service. The whole order was around 1400 bucks which is a bit expensive for without alcohol but you get a dining experience and embience so good.

We ordered the lamb lasagna and we literally had ONE piece of lasagna which really shocked me. Then we had the chicken steak which was decent - nothing special. We gave up on their main courses so went straight to desserts. We ordered the warm apple pie, cheesecake, and the Brazilian chocolate cremeux.

3. Pepper chicken bao
4. Ginger chicken bao
5. Fish and chips
6. Cajun chicken breast sizzler

The bao's are a must try. Both of them were yummy. Fish and chips were in the same category as well but this time the fish wasn't that great. Coming to the sizzler...i felt chicken was a little hard and the veges needed a pinch of salt. A little bland for my taste.

Tried their grilled tenderloin steak as well, but it did not live upto the expectations. It was dry and chewy sadly. Their pastas are quite tasty (we tried ours in pink sauce), so are their pizzas (we tried garden veg). If you like fish and chips, try it out here, will not be disappointed. Their cold coffee isn't that great, bitter and watery (I like the creamy and balanced kind). If you like mocktails, I would suggest that you leave out the Ginger Lime fizz.

Deli 9 Bistro,Moonis Ahmed,"Been here quite a number of times and have tried their varitey of burgers, pizzas and grilled chicken. My all time favourites have been cajun marinated chicken breast and tex-mex burger. It is just the way they cook the meat that it becomes succulent and juicy without losing any of its flavors. I would highly recommend the tex-mex burger. Delicious cheese and patty with vegetables makes one hell of a bite. Their pizzas are also taste worthy. Despite being a non-vegetarian, I really enjoyed their garden veg pizzas with their thin crusts and generous toppings. 

Besides the food, their service is quick and the ambiance is definitely something you can enjoy with your friends and colleagues even on a weekday.

Highly recommended if you are in the area near Wipro circle Gachibowli.
