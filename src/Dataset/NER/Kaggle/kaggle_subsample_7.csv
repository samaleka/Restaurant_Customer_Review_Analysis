PourHouse7,Suman Ghosh,"Pocket-friendly place for a quick round of drinks. Tried their LIIT & Tequila Sunrise, along with a bunch of Chicken, Fish & veg starters. In the drinks, the Tequila Sunrise stood out with a distinct flavor, while LIIT was just the standard one. Would recommend to try the Chicken Nazakath - it lived up to its name with juicy and succulent pieces :-)

The place has 2+2 on Zomato Gold, and offers happy hours every day till evening. So saves the pocket-pinch.",3,"81 Reviews , 240 Followers",5/25/2019 14:48,0,,"{'food': ['Chicken', 'Fish', 'veg'], 'drink': ['Tequila Sunrise', 'LIIT']}"

PourHouse7,Rohan - Total Foodie,"Usually don't get a chance to go out for lunch on weekdays, but finally got a chance with colleagues to do so after a client meeting. Since the meeting was in Gachibowli, we decided to try out a place not too far from IKEA.
So we landed at PourHouse7 which is located above the maruti showroom.
For appetizers we started by ordering Kung Pao chicken, spicy black pin chicken, stir fried vegetables and also order a veg spring salad. Both the chicken appetizers were excellent, the Kung Pao chicken was hot and spicy and the spicy black pin was a little sweet and sour and full of flavor. The stir fried vegetables was made of a plethora of vegetables which included mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini, baby corn and carrots.
Along with appetizers we ordered mocktails, blue sea, virgin mojito, pinacolada and PH7's special in house mocktail. Among the mocktails the one which stood out was the special in house drink.
Coming to main course, we ordered paneer butter masala, butter chicken and rotis. The butter chicken was delicious, chicken was tender, buttery and cooked perfectly. Paneer was soft and fresh.
The best dish of our lunch was the 7H special biryani. Wrapped in an omelette, the biryani was visually appealing. The rice was flavorful, chicken full of spices and this biryani was amazing.
Overall we had a fantastic time. If anyone is around gachibowli and looking for a drink and good food, this is the place to visit.",5,"157 Reviews , 505 Followers",4/11/2019 15:13,6,,
PourHouse7,Sneha Panda,"Pour House 7 is very easy to locate as it is around half a kilometre away from IKEA. It is on the fourth floor if the building.

AMBIENCE -
It gives you best of both worlds. It has rooftop seatings and an air conditioned seating. The ambience is very sassy. It is surely a party place.

FOOD -

‚Ä¢MOCKTAILS-
I tried flavoured Mojito, Virgin Mojito, PH7 special Mojito, Pina Colada and Sweet Sunrise. All the mocktails were flavourful, beautiful and refreshing. My personal favourite was Sweet Sunrise.

‚Ä¢STARTERS AND SALAD
I tried Kung Pao Chicken, Crispy Corn, Stir Fried Vegetables, Veg Spring Salad and Spicy Black Pin.

Kung Pao Chicken: The chicken was well cooked and most importantly, it wasn't bland. The spices were just right for a person like me who prefers spicy food. The dish also included honey so it tasted slightly sweet which took the dish on another level. üÜô Definitely a must try!

Spicy Black Pin: It was kinda similar to Kung pao chicken but was grilled and wasn't sweet. It tasted nice.

Crispy Corn: It was sweet and crispy. Presentation was on point. üëå

Stir Fried Vegetables: The vegetables were cooked properly and the spices were complimenting the vegetables.

Veg Spring Salad: It was very tasty and healthy. The coating of the salad was bringing the best taste of the veggies.

‚Ä¢MAIN COURSE-
I tried Chicken Alfredo Pasta, Sicilian Pizza, Paneer Tikka Masala, Naan, Butter Chicken and 7H Biryani.

Chicken Alfredo Pasta: It was creamy and absolutely delicious. The chicken was very well cooked. Loved it!

Sicilian Pizza: It was loaded with veggies and the amount of cheese was okay. I'm not a "" too much Cheese"" person so it tasted good. Also, you can ask the staff to put more cheese.

Paneer tikka masala: It was spicy and flavourful. The paneer was soft and tender. Very well made üëå

Butter Chicken: The chicken was tender and juicy. The gravy was very rich. Loved it‚ú®

Naan: Perfectly madeüëå

7H Biryani: It had lip smacking flavours. The presentation was on a whole new level.üëå It was enclosed in omelette. The chicken was flavourful and the basmati rice and tender and tasty. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

All in all: 5/5

My personal favorite was definitely Pina colada! And how can I not mention their mouth water biryani and Kung Pao chicken the kung Pao chicken it's so flavor full at first you'll taste the garlic & then a hit of sweetness Because of it's honey I definitely recommend it to people

PourHouse7,Hardik Nahata,"Here is my Review!

LOCATION:-
Very easy to locate, it is very near to IKEA, a prominent landmark in Hyderabad. Its on the 4th floor, also rooftop option is available in the evening time. 

AMBIENCE :-

Once you enter the Pub, the interior will blow you away. The unique point about PH7 is the view it provides through big windows of the hustle of Gachibowli and high-rise buildings around.

FOOD :-
I tried lot many things here ! Here is the detailed review of every item:

MOCKTAILS:
-
PH7 SPECIAL MOCKTAIL- It literally holds the name! The most colorful mojito I ever came across, the flavors will tickle your taste buds!

BLUE SEA- Its so beautiful to look at! The blue shade darkens down the bottom which contains lichi cream and makes this mojito special for sweet lovers.

PINA COLADA- You might wanna skip this one, I found the flavors not complementing each other.

FLAVORED VIRGIN MOJITO - Most recommended drink for hot summers. Refreshing, minty and relaxing !

SALADS:-
STIR FRIED VEGETABLES- The main thing about the salads is its seasoning, the taste of the cooked veggies was so good. They could go a bit less on the oil though.

VEG SPRING SALAD- It gives you the authentic taste of the vegetables, the dressing of the salad and spices used makes it tasty!

MAIN:-

BUTTER PANEER & ROTI- I prefer Paneer curries to be spicy and buttery, and no doubt they nail it! Its pretty heavy, I was almost done with 2 Rotis.

SICILIAN PIZZA - The pizza was stuffed a lot with toppings, cheese was a bit less. You can mention to add more cheese to make it better. It was okay overall.

CRISPY CORN - The presentation of the dish was unique and catchy. The taste was anyway a bit different from my liking, as i prefer it salty n spicy, and not sweet. Could be my own preference. You can still try it out.

OVERALL:-
Pour House 7 is the go-to spot if you're around Gachibowli and are hunger-stuck! I would surely recommend this place. Do try out in the night-time and enjoy the rooftop :)",5,"10 Reviews , 139 Followers",4/10/2019 21:15,11,,"{'food': ['MOCKTAILS:', 'BLUE SEA:', 'PINA COLADA:', 'FLAVORED VIRGIN MOJITO:', 'STIR FRIED VEGETABLES:', 'VEG SPRING SALAD:', 'BUTTER PANEER & ROTI:', 'SICILIAN PIZZA:', 'CRISPY CORN:', 'OVERALL:', 'POUR HOUSE 7'], 'drink': []}"

Dj was good and adapted according to the crowd.
We started off with Butter garlic prawns and chicken popcorn. Both of them turned out to be very oily. We further ordered Fish tikka which was okayish. Masala papad was in good quantity and tastier for a change. They wer unable to manage a bunch of hooligan crowd who were throwing beer around unable to differentiate it with champagne.

PourHouse7 is a spacious rooftop bar that offers amazing ambiance, like a bird-eye point of view, with live music and screening. They have comfortable seating arrangement according to our convenience. And the service was prompt and the staff was polite & friendly.

Coming to Mocktails:
We tried Virgin Mojito, Virgin Colada and Sweet Sunrise. The Virgin Mojito and Sweet sunrise were really refreshing and the Virgin Colada was okay.

Appetizers:
Murgh lasooni Kali mirch tikka:
Tandoori Chicken with black pepper, cardamom & garam masala. Chicken skewers soaked in marinade, cooked in a tandoor with spices, giving it the rustic feels which were super delicious. Highly recommend.

Crispy chilli fish:
The flavour and the texture of this crispy chilli fish was really amazing.

Classic chicken spring rolls:
The rolls filled with chicken and full of veggies were deeply fried. The taste was amazing and the crispness was on point. And served with a sweet & spicy sauce dip. Must try out.

Great Nawabi pizza:
The pizza was loaded with cheese, chicken and veggies. And the taste was great but the presentation could have been better.

Tangadi kabab:
Chicken drumsticks marinated in aromatic Indian spices and grilled to perfection which were really amazing in terms of taste.

Onion rings:
These easy onion rings are double dipped in a batter that is seasoned to perfection. The crust was crisp and the onions were tender and sweet served with hot & spicy sauce.

Main course
7H biryani:
The biryani was enclose in egg omelette, the chicken was tender and the basmati rice was fluffy which was amazing in taste.

Pesto-rice with chicken stroganoff:
Pesto green rice is flavoured with jarred pesto and topped with fresh herbs and chicken stroganoff made with chicken breast smothered in a sour cream stroganoff sauce which was really delicious.

Dessert:
We tried Brownie with vanilla ice-cream topped with Hershey‚Äôs syrup which was a treat to our taste buds.

There was just one bartender on a Friday night, which really escalated the waiting time. Service on the food section was even slower. As the fries ordered at 9pm were served at 10pm. I was extremely displeased.

It took three people from their staff one after the other to confirm what we had ordered and it was only one dish. We had to wait for 25-30 minutes for the order only to realise they had served it to somebody else. This was when there were only 5 tables occupied. The staff seemed inexperienced.
The toilet's location is just bad. Whenever somebody opens the toilet door the whole place stinks up like piss.
We just gave up on the place and left paying for the drinks that they had managed to serve.

Preferred drinking a full bottle than sipping on shots along side ordered for Corn kernels, Chic Lollipop, Malai Broccoli as accompaniment to the alcohol and all were indeed severed on time, tasted good too.

This place is a newbie in town (or maybe I am wrong) However, I got to meet an Old Pal who was playing on sets as the guest Dj for that night there.

Then we ordered nazaakat kebab(chicken starter),wakto cylindo chicken.
These tasted good and would love to go back to have these.
Butte de kwaab a corn item which looks like hari bari kebab was also good .
The sea food starter,butter garlic fish which was also well cooked and served.
The classic onion rings (called burj kalifa because of its presentation) which was the best among all the starters.
It was served with tamato sauce which was a great combination.

They have a seating arrangement for rooftop and indoor seating arrangement.

Coming to the Foood!

Was here for a lunch session.

Started by some delicious mocktails.

All were good. The one which I liked the most was Raspberry. Though they didn‚Äôt had much variety on the menu for mocktails still they served us 8 different mocktails.

Soups.

‚Ä¢Healthy Broth Soup:-It was just Ok in taste.

‚Ä¢Tom Kai Soup:- Non Veg one. It was good.

Starters.

‚Ä¢Nazakat Kebab:- It was really tasty and spicy they could‚Äôve served with mayo but still it was good.

‚Ä¢Hariyali Paneer Tikka:-Green In color, soft and spicy.

‚Ä¢Wakto Cylindo Chicken:-Perfectly marinated good in taste. Loved the taste.

‚Ä¢Hong Kong Paneer:-Soft and Juicy could‚Äôve improved.

‚Ä¢Bhutte Aee Kabab:- Veg item. Good one. Tasted good.

‚Ä¢Butter Garlic Fish:-Really good in taste. Must try here at Pour House.

‚Ä¢Chicken Alfredo Pasta:-Delicious Cheesy Pasta with shredded chicken. Loved it.

‚Ä¢Classic Onions Rings:-Beautifully presented crispy and tasty.

‚Ä¢Great Nawabi Pizza:- Could‚Äôve been better. But not bad. Serving mayo on the top was major Drawback.

Main course.

‚Ä¢7H Biryani:-One of the most delicious biryani I ever had. I must say it is one of the MUST TRY for all the Biryani lovers. Beautifully presented.

‚Ä¢Kadai Chicken:- Spicy and ok in taste.

‚Ä¢Miloni Sabzi:-Filled with so much Cream had a buttery taste.

‚Ä¢Roti Basket:- Assorted breads all kind of.

Desserts‚ù§Ô∏è

Brownie with Honey Sauce:-Brownie could‚Äôve been more soft that‚Äôs it. Good one.

Overall the place looks really good with decent ambience and pocket Friendly prices and friendly staff.
Place is highly recommended to try 7H special Biryani and Pasta and some mocktails too.

PourHouse7,Harshitha. K,"Pour House 7 is located just above Maruthi showroom, that's pretty close to Ikea at Gachibowli.
Ambience- So, the place is really spacious with both indoor seating( club ) and a rooftop bar! Their indoor section has a simple bar set up with vibrant paintings on the wall at the entrance, cozy leather sofas in black and dim lighting. Their rooftop area is well done with brick walls, high chairs/ tables and trees planted in pots. They've a DJ set up and a big screen as well! So guys, how about beating the heat with their cocktails while enjoying the fabulous view of the city from the rooftop?

Food- I was here with my friends the other day for lunch and we tried the following,
APPETIZERS
* Tandoori malai broccoli- Broccoli are marinated in cheese & cashew paste and cooked in a tandoor! It was scrumptious. ( 4/5 )

* Crispy chapa- Fish fillets are marinated in Indian masala and deep fried to perfection! It was topped with fried curry leaves and chillies. Must try! ( 5/5 )

* Chicken nachos- Tortilla chips topped with pieces of chicken, red beans, corn and other veggies were delish you guys! Another favourite. ( 4/5 )

* Fish fingers- Fish fillets cut into strips are coated with bread crumbs and deep fried. They were so crispy from the outside and tender from the inside. It came along with french fries and mayonnaise. ( 5/5 )

* Moroccan chicken sticks- Grilled chicken skewers marinated in olive oil and other spices! They were smoky and appetizing. ( 4/5 )

* Jhinga nasheela- Prawns marinated in Indian masala and grilled! It was crispy and medium spiced. ( 3/5 )

* Bruschetta- Slices of sandwich bread are topped with veggies & cheese and baked! They were seasoned with red chilli flakes. Honestly, It wasn't even bruschetta in the first place! Give it a miss. ( 2/5 )

MAIN COURSE-
* 7H special chicken biryani- Basmati rice cooked along with pieces of chicken marinated in Indian masala! The entire dish was covered with an omelette that was topped with fried onions. It was truly unique in terms of both taste and presentation. Highly recommend the biryani! ( 5/5 )

* Spaghetti aglio e olio( veg )- Spaghetti tossed in olive oil along with black olives, garlic and chilli flakes! It was appetizing. ( 4/5 )

* Great nawabi pizza- Pizza topped with chicken tikka, veggies and mayo! Although the toppings were generous and spicy, the base of the pizza was a serious let down! It was hard. ( 3/5 )

* Alishaan chicken s/w- Pieces of chicken, lettuce and other veggies along with mayo are sandwiched between two grilled breads! Served along with fries and salad. It was just okay-ish. ( 3/5 )

DRINKS
So we tried a few mocktails( about 5 ) and honestly they were bad! The only saviour was Virgin Mojito.

The staff are polite and friendly!

We started off with Haryali paneer tikka whixh was extremely tender and juicy
The other vegetarian delicacies we had were Chilly paneer and Bhutte de kebab . Loved the kebab unexpectedly. Recommending that kebab.
Butter Garlic fish was something differently exquisite. It was topped with gravy and when you eat a piece it was crunchy. Its very tough to do that,Kudos to the chef.
Nazakhat kebab and Mutton mazedaar were kind of favourites because of their awesome taste.
For maincourse we had the 7 H Biryani. It was delicious biryani full of chicken and masala covered totally by an omelet topping.
The crispy onion rings and its special sauce were the showstoppers of the day. Totally loved it.
For desserts we had the caramelized brownie with ice cream.

Been here last weekend and tasted some of the Sig ature delicacies.

Roof-top had a beautiful ambiance and a beautiful skyline view of High Rise buildings in the surrounding.

Started off with Some exotic colourful mocktails. Mocktails tasted good but they lacked that Fizz! Informed the same to the manager who was polite to take it as a feedback. Chocotina shake was superbbbb!

Starters which I really liked were, 7 house Crispy Fish, Chicken Majestic and Paneer ke Sholay.

Fish was juicy and crispy on the outside, and tasted so good with the spices that were coated.

There was this Burj Khalifa Onion Rings appetizer, which was innovative and was best with the sauce that it came with.

They have Special Biryani in their maincourse which was worth Having.

Great Nawabi Pizza was with trying. Also,NonVeg Pasta in White sauce.

Choco Brownie with Vanilla ice Cream and Gulab Jamun with Vanilla Icecream were in the desserts.

PourHouse7,Karna Nair,"Today I visited this place called Pour House 7 in Gachibowli.The place has indoors as well as rooftop seating.The rooftop seating gives you a panoramic view of the area and is breezy and well lit.The indoor seating is more of like a party space which will be ideal for small to medium sized groups.Coming to the food it was really mind blowing.We tried a bunch of items and majority of them tasted great.Lets have a look at the items we tried starting from Mocktails to appetizers and main course and ending it with desserts.
Firstly we had Tandoori Malai Broccoli which literally surprised me.Who had thought Broccoli could be that tasty....It tasted amazing with a creamy taste to it.Next we had Crispy chapa which is basically crispy crump coated fried fish with curry leaves seasoning which gave it a unique flavour.This was an outstanding dish and all of us loved it.Morrocan Chicken sticks was our next item and this one was also pretty good.The chicken was slightly smoky with a good amount of spicy seasonings on top.The chicken was nice tender and juicy too.I love seafood and so I ended up ordering a Jhinga Nasheela...This tasted good but nothing extraordinary about it.It was just good that's it.We also had Chicken Nachos which was served in a big bowl with lots of cheese and salsa and the right seasoning.Loved it.We also had a Bruschetta which was average.Along with these we also ordered Aalishaan Chicken sandwich which I would say was not at all aalishaan.This was not good.It lacked the right amount of chicken in it and was overall not tasty.Next we had a Nawabi Chicken pizza and it was really good.The topping was great with lots of chicken and cheese and was true to its name but the down side of the pizza was its base.The pizza base was really hard and dry which overall brings down the dish but I still had it because of the amazing topping.We had a platter of Fish Fingers and fries and it was excellent.Both the fish fingers and the fries were good.
After devouring all these starters we could only go for two main course dishes and so we decided to go for the Special 7H Biriyani and Spaghetti Aglio-e-olio.I am in love with their biriyani.It was not like any other biriyani that I have ever tasted before.It was unique and it was excellent too.It has a completely different flavour from all the other biriyanis in Hyderabad and I could not guess what's the secret ingredient was.The spaghetti I would say was decent but was definitely not among my favourites.
Now coming to the desserts we had vanilla ice cream and Gulab Jamuns.I would say the dessert section does not provide for much choices.The Jamuna were decent.
We also had some moctails in between which were not up to the mark.They need to improve their moctails.The only one I felt was perfect was the Virgin Mojito.Other Mocktails we had were not good.We had some litchi based ones and orange based ones and also a pinacolada flavoured one.But we did not like these much.

Overall I would say that the place offers really good food and the ambience is also great.The drinks need immense improvement.Thats it folks.This was my review of the place.Hope you like it.",5,"30 Reviews , 63 Followers",2/22/2019 21:30,15,,"{'food': ['Tandoori Malai Broccoli', 'Crispy Chapa', 'Moroccan Chicken Sticks', 'Jhinga Nasheela', 'Chicken Nachos', 'Bruschetta', 'Aalishaan Chicken Sandwich', 'Nawabi Chicken Pizza', 'Fish Fingers and Fries', 'Special 7H Biriyani', 'Spaghetti Aglio-e-olio', 'Vanilla Ice Cream', 'Gulab Jamuns', 'Virgin Mojito'], 'drink': []}"

The staff doesn't know a thing about service. Tables are unclean and stick! As usual the stupid DJ is Soo loud but it got better later. Poor maintainince of the place adds to everything. I literally had to go and shout to have someone take my order. Waiter is so absent minded. Imagine not even getting a glass of water for 40mins.
The poor manager had to wait tables and supply cutlery to the required people. Some waiters were just standing there and enjoying music as if they own the place. There was this one particular guy who was soo arrogant that he started back talking and arguing. It was a really pathetic experience and I would definitely choose a different place next time.

Special mention to Dharmender, who was very attentive.
I haven't tasted much of their menu, but the white sauce penne pasta was average, I expected it to be more flavorful and have consistent creamy texture but it wasnt. The chicken wings were a little sweet and not that great if you want to have some spicy good to go with your drinks. The only thing I liked about the place was that it stocked Kalhua which was out of stock at almost all other places.

We visited this place for dinner. The weather was freezing cold, i was craving some hot soup.
We ordered chicken manchow soup and lemon coriander soup. The soups were perfect for a freezing cold evening.
Comming to the mocktails the virgin colada, chatpata madness and sex on the beach were very soothing.
Starters were delicious we had
Hyderabadi tawa fish which was so much flavourful.
Lahsuni paneer tikka was so smooth and melting in mouth.
Tandoori broccoli was my favourite from this place.
Main course was really gud.
Finishing with the desserts the hot chocolate brownie with ice cream was too tempting and sweet.

PourHouse7,Eat Like Jo üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥,"At Gachibowli we have a new rooftop dining place which captures the astonishing view of Hyderabad‚Äôs new side overlooking the mighty IKEA. We dined at Pourhouse7 where they house a club too at the floor below the rooftop.
.
It was drop dead gorgeous view from there and the weather was cold with chill winds so we had to put our jackets back on. But on a regular evening, the place would be warm. They have been serving us some nice cocktails and some punchy mocktails like chatpata masala.
.
The starters were not that great and needs much improvement. They had chicken manchow soup, and coriander soup which were really bleak and the place won‚Äôt be expecting much orders on them as it‚Äôs a bar. The Hyderabadi Tawa Fish was exceptionally great and turned out to be my favourite of the night. In the vegetarian department I‚Äôll recommend Tandoori Broccoli ü•¶.
.
Further to the main course the Tangadi kebab was perfectly cooked juicy chicken legs. The masalas of Cashew nut chicken and chicken tikka were soo tasty. They were an amazing combination with the rotis. The place has improve a lot on a handful of starters and rest will be taken care of.

Right from the Entry there was a confusion. We did a booking through Dine Out for 8:30 pm which didn't really make sense as the table were not blocked. To figure this out we have to wait for 20 mins for the manager to come. When asked about the reservation, Manager was totally Rude and said to my wife that ""She should be happy that she got a table"". I mean WOW, it was an eye opener for us.
And at that point I realised this is one of the mostly badly managed places.

No doubt its huge with good lighting , Ambience and Dance floor but the service is pathetic.
The Food is average and costly. Nothing great in drinks. Prices are all on a higher side. 
We just got a drink and a platter and left to a much better managed and a calm place.

Prism Club & Kitchen,Mohammed Talib,"The new place in the financial district which everyone is talking about and is known for its dance floor as its USP.

I went here with my team on Friday night and booked upper deck for the same. The place no doubt is very spacious and has one of the best dance floors in Hyderabad. The light system and other props were good. It reminded me of Club Octagon in Gangnam, Seoul. Overall ambience is good with 2 levels of seating where ground floor can is suitable for small groups or couples and upper deck has sofa sets for bigger groups.

Food is just average here. Starters like paneer tikka, baby corn or chicken tikka were very greasy. Main course was also not upto the mark.

Worst thing I experienced about this place is the service.
I asked person attending us to start the main course at 8.30 pm. To which he replied it will take another half an hour to get the main course ready. It would have been fine if main course got started at the said time but after many more follow ups it started at 10 pm !! This really pissed me off and ruined whole experience.

I wanted to give 1 star but giving it 2 just because of ambience.

Prism Club & Kitchen,Sugandha Saxena,"Prism is touted to be the owner of a huge club space, and rightly so.

The place is located somewhere in Financial District, after you take a turn from the Lemon Tree hotel. I pretty much had no clue about where I was exactly, and the almost stranded road is of not much help. Until you suddenly see the big lit up sign with the word Prism inscribed on it, though conveniently covered by the bushes around it. Another 100m or so, you reach their parking yard, and finally the enter the premises after it.

A huge velvety door opens into this big sized covered arena (for a lack of better word), that tell you that it can never get overcrowded on the dance floor. The place has high tables next to the dance area, and then some couches on the far side. There is a beautifully lit up staircase, that leads to a more relaxed lounge kind of seating.

And that is just one part of it. They have an outdoor seating, where the projector is put up for the match screening, and doubles up as the smoking zone. Apart from this, they have a pool, which would be apt for a private gathering.

I am no club expert, but their light system is sure one of their USP. The DJ played majorly Bollywood that evening (it was a Wednesday), and did a decent enough job.

While the place is all decked up pretty well, the food on offer didn't impress me much.

üî∏STARTERS

üîπBurmese Roll with sweet chilli dip: A bit too oily, they were okay to munch on. They could have done with a bit more filling, though.

üîπPunjabi Paneer Tikka with mint dip: Failed to impress. The paneer was too rubbery in some places, and in others, too charred. The lingering taste was merely of chilli, and nothing else.

üî∏MAINS

üîπPrism Special Veggie Lover Pizzaüåü: The dish that fared best with me. It was thin crust and had a good amount of cheese. For the price, it may seem a bit costly, but quite worth it, as compared to other dishes.

üîπSpaghetti: Their take of spaghetti aglio olio, with mushrooms and black olive toppings. This was also decent.

üîπPenne Alfredo: This was just regular, nothing good or bad. And this also goes for the accompanying garlic bread.

I didn't find the Indian mains anything great, and needs to be improved a lot.

The dessert was another downer. Chocolate Truffle was all goey and just cream.

From the mocktails section, I chose the safest bet Go Crazy. It was a twist on the oreo shake, with the inclusion of KitKat, but it wasn't great either. Lacked the comfort of a regular oreo shake.

If you are looking for a party place, that has a happening setup, good crowd and amazing ambience, this is your best bet. But for the food, it is better you stick with safe bets such as pizzas and pastas. They would give you the best value for money. The alcohol is also a little pricey, but you wouldn't mind that in a place like this.",3,"150 Reviews , 2135 Followers",3/31/2019 14:36,17,,
Prism Club & Kitchen,Vivek Jain,"By Invite

The pub is located in the Financial District in Gachibowli, the pub is currently the largest in Hyderabad in terms of area. As you enter you cross your way through a large parking space and pathway to overlook a huge monkey like figure enjoying music.

The pub feels start as soon as a glance falls on the building with colorful lights. The ambience inside is amazing and is spread over two floors with the ground floor having the huge dance floor and pubs and a seating area upstairs. The USP of the dance floor is the literally lit up chandelier made of LED rings grooving to the beat of the music also the walls have lights synced to this.

There is also an outdoor seating where you can watch your favorite matches and when bored head to the dance floor back indoor.

Coming to the Food:

Punjabi Paneer Tikka (Rs. 325):
Thick cubes of paneer marinated with mustard and curd base. Was not soft and requires lot of improvement. A strict no to this dish.

Burmese Rolls (Rs. 275):
A different kind of spring rolls filled with corn, garlic and cheese. The taste was delectable with the right balance of flavors and enhanced by the sweet chilli dip. The only issue was not that crispy and a bit more oily.

Mains:

For the mains we had Exotic Vegetables in Black Pepper with Rice, the curry was just ok had a decent flavor but didn't have the distinctive flavor of the pepper sauce in it.

Prism Special Veg Pizza:
The thin crust pizza loaded with cheese and topped with veggies like zucchini was the best main course that we had among the served. The pizza was decent in taste had not much of marinara base but was not bland either. The pizza was although not crispy as we got busy catching up the tricks performed by the bartenders.

Apart from these we were also served Veg Pulao and Meloni Tarkari curry which was completely average and to be skipped.

Drinks:

Cucumber Coriander Mocktail: The cucumber coriander mocktail was too sweet. The flavor of cucumber had dominated the slight tinge of coriander.

Go Crazy:
The blend of Oreo and chocolates was nothing out of the box and tasted like a regular chocolate shake.

Recommended Dishes:

Burmese Rolls
Prism Pizza (If you need a main course)

The place is highly average in terms of food despite being an ideal place to enjoy the night life. So is not recommended.

Prism Club & Kitchen,Asha JS,"Emerging as one of the best clubs in Hyderabad...............for those who love partying this place is indeed for you.

Plus points:-
1. Great space
2. Utilized well in terms of inner area, private section, seating's, lighting, DJ console, outer smoke area and swimming pool space for mini party gatherings and very important PARKING.
3. Dance floor is great, unless in lot of clubs its get so crowded and claustrophobic.
4. Bar counter looks absolute great.
5. Barmen showing all juggling skills, is eye candy experience.
6. Good varieties of drinks but they can improve on that part a bit.
7. Few good finger foods get you sorted for your party plans.

Minus :-

1. Food wise they need to improve as it's normal nothing special or different and price wise it's not that competitive.
2. Staff over here need bit of training in terms of hospitality, being rigid spoils the mood. A cute smile can change lot of things.............:-)

Starters :-

Chicken Lahsooni was good, garlic taste was evident but overpowered which is a good thing, served with mini papad rolls and chutney. Burmese rolls is something which I relished with corn and green chilies with some cheese stuffing it got in my favorite list. Fish fingers was too was decent enough. Pizza was good too both chicken and farm fresh pizza as toppings were loaded, but make sure you have it hot or warm as you like. They certainly need to improve the pasta and paneer tikka. 

All in all a great place for partying and events organised by Prism management - don't miss them at all. Monday to Thursday they mostly play Bollywood and commercial hits. Corporate crowd is regular as lots of Multi National Companies are in neighborhood. Friday to Sunday they have different themes like Electro, Techno and EDM so all those partyholics have a blast at this new place in Hyderabad.

Happy Partying Guys...........................:-)

Prism Club & Kitchen,Shreshth Malhotra,"An evening well spent at Prism club and Kitchen. The place is situated relatively outside the main city in Financial district and has a huge area to offer. One can enjoy Poolside as well as at the sitting which is offered near the Dance floor. With big live screens and a great DJ, there is a lot of entertainment that you can expect out of the place.

Started my food experience with their Appetizers. I tried out their Punjabi Paneer tikka, Fish Finger, Lehsooni Murgh tikka and Veg Burmese rolls. The Punjabi Paneer tikka was good. It had an exquisite flavor to it which was top notch. Served along with Onion salad and traditional mint chutney, one can give this dish a shot. Next up, their Fish fingers were quite normal for my palate. They could improve the side dip and can use tartar dip as an option. 

My favorite dish of the night was their Lehsooni Murgh tikka. It had a really fantastic smoky flavor of garlic flakes to it and was super tender. The spice mix was really complimenting the chicken and is a must try for you all. Veg Burmese rolls was a big disappointment for me. It had some extra oil to it which could have been clearly avoided. They need to work on the filling as well as the outer crust of the rolls.

For their drinks, I tried out their Cosmopolitan, Margarita and Passion. All the drinks were simply wonderful. It was truly a great experience overall to have the right kind of drinks at this place.

For mains, I had their Exotic vegetables in Black pepper sauce with Rice, Farmer Chicken pizza, Penne white sauce pasta. Exotic vegetables in Black pepper sauce was good. I usually don't like to have this at most outlets due to the overpowering taste of the Black pepper sauce but somehow these guys served it very well alongside some Rice. Their Farmer Chicken pizza was too good. Loved the overall consistency of the dish. A slight work needs to be put up in their Pasta. I didn't find it much cheesy and tasty. 

The place setup is quite big and they certainly have a good potential to improve on their food. Great place for partying for sure.

Prism Club & Kitchen,Pranay Bejjenki,"Such a pathetic experience I had in this place. 
First, I called them on their number to check if it is open at 6 PM on a Sunday. The person who received call on behave of Prism stated that it is open from 6 PM. Once we reach there by 6:30 PM, no staff was ready to respond and said who told you it is open now. The way they spoke to their customer is really annoying. ""I Don't know to whom you have called and taken the confirmation about the open hours but, as you came early I am considering you and giving a table"". Is this how low they treat a customer? 

Secondly, When requested for a good seat as there is no crowd available. The manager or a person with attitude told us ""No, there are no seats available""(In a bold manner). When I checked from Zomato there are plenty of tables available. I got pinched with irritation. Though, I felt the lighting is good and order for drinks to my friends.

Finally, Me and my friends were feeling uncomfortable with the way people treating their customer. And then, mosquitoes came into picture. There are full of mosquitoes hissing around our heads and of course no AC has turned ON. Out of frustration, we tried cancelling the food that was ordered by us and everything we ordered. They said, it is not possible to cancel the order and your order will be here in 20 minutes. I was like ""WTF"". I asked for cheque and paid the bill without having anything and left the place. Such a disappointing experience it was. I suggest do not visit this place where customers are not treated well.",1,"3 Reviews , 1 Follower",3/27/2019 14:25,0,,"{'food': ['Such a pathetic experience I had in this place.'], 'drink': []}"

The place has got good dance floor... it has got many areas in it indoor... pool area ... garden area....
Visited this place for event hilight tribe booked a VIP pass entry ... from book my show app near the entry they taped a band our wrist after entering into the prism the managers over there and bouncers over there didn‚Äôt allow us to enter the area which was up , saying it‚Äôs full than okay den make us seat some where they where like stand near the bar counter it was so annoying we paid some 3000 rupees for vip entry per ticket and they don‚Äôt allow to vip area and say to stand near bar ... dan we asked the manager two give table he said u have to pay 10000 per table ..... I said it‚Äôs not mentioned in book my show app tat we have to pay for table and ur not allowing us to go up to vip area ...what is this he was like ur wish madam dan I said see we r all gals u should at least allow us to enter VIP area he was again like full dan we got really paronoid .... seee gals need safety we just can‚Äôt be in common crowd he didn‚Äôt understood tat also dan we had to make a call.... hope u understand DAN we got a table after a calll so cheap f these managers there....
than we got our personal waiter too after d call
My question is what about a common people who can‚Äôt make calls and get the work done so better develop ur managers if u have taken money for vip let d crowd enter into tat area if u don‚Äôt have place don‚Äôt issue tickets mention in book my show about booking a table separately for the amount make sure u serve the people for what u have told

The drinks and food was not that great it‚Äôs over priced compared to other top places in Hyderabad

Every one earns there money with hard work so the owner of the place plz do think f the common crowd u charge but provide dem for what u have charged hope u understand and make the changes

The Property is huge as you enter the Club. There not much seating for crowd as I have heard its biggest club in Hyderabad. The food was tasty and service very quick even after they have huge crowd. The staff is polite and helpful.. DJ Suketu was awesome he played superb Bollywood tunes. It has a seperate smoking zone outside which is good.

Prism Club & Kitchen,Deepak Banka,"Pros:
Awesome dance floor with stunning lighting and a giant screen.
Cool ambience.
They always have the best DJs.
Cons:
Too much Vip culture. Almost all the tables are reserved. It's almost impossible to get a table. You are told to get a place in the bar counter but there also, its always packed and if you would find one empty space and go and stand there, you would be told that even that space of bar counter is reserved and that bar tender is also reserved to serve only the VIPs. Even if you somehow managed to order, standing in that cranked space you won't be able to enjoy the food. Entry fee is 2k with 500 cover charge. After paying that you would atleast expect a place where you can stand and enjoy your food and drinks.

Prism Club & Kitchen,Ashok Choudhary,"I have been on Friday night and reached at round 10pm.
It was almost full we hardly get space for standing.
They occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking 500 bucks for just entry out of 2k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead.
We could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood.
I must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group.
Dj was playing good track and it was enjoyable moment we spent.
Zomato is showing 1200 for two ppl which is really surprising üòÇ even though you cant step down to this place until unless spend 2k bucks so be aware and keep your pocket tight as this place is not for normal class people üòâ.",3,"90 Reviews , 289 Followers",1/26/2019 16:35,1,,"{'food': ['Friday night', 'round 10pm', 'huge space', 'designed interior'], 'drink': []}"

Dine O China,Abhishek Priyadarshi,"Ohh finally the wait is over, I have been seeing this restaurant from quite sometime and finally I am at Dine O China. From outside it looks good. I got flat 50% offer from Dine out ""that's exciting""..

First thing to try was Chicken Tom Yum soup.. ohh it was one good tasting soup I had for a while. And then from nowhere we ordered butter garlic prawn.. it surprised me as well.. never seen this in a Chinese restaurant and to no surprise it was HORRIBLE.. battered fried butter garlic prawn with no hint of butter anywhere.. with my experience I would call it a piece of &#-+.. it was all crapy.. and when I asked I got the reply that the Chinese chef has changed... And they replaced the item with chilly garlic prawn.. it was ok for my liking..

Now we have ordered

 Chicken drumsticks

Shezwan chicken dimsums

Singapore noodles mix

Chinese chopsuey

Yang Chow Rice

Schezwan Chicken

To sum up the best item was chicken drumsticks. 

Dimsums where stale and the outer coating was all soggy.

Singapore noodles was more vermicelli than noodles.

Yan chow rice was good

So was Schezwan chicken.

Experience was decent I would say specially with the offer I got.. flat 50% off.

A loud shout out to the dine out team ..

I would wish to come again if I get such offer .. but a friendly suggestion to the restaurant.. please try and make some change as we have very less Chinese restaurant nearby..

Dine O China,Nidhi Joshi,"It was a date with my girls who wanted to eat Chinese so we decided to go to Dine O China for the simple reason that it is close to home and it turned out that we chose a super place to have Chinese.
The restaurant is located in Gachibowli and is easy to drive to from ORR and has a proper basement parking so no issues even on the busy Gachibowli road; for me it is a major point of concern if I am driving on my own so at least parking was sorted.
We entered the restaurant and were warmly welcomed by a stewardess who took down our order and served us. It felt like by the women for the women. It felt comfortable that is all.
The seating arrangement is quite comfortable and I particularly liked the chairs as they were so comfortable. We ordered chicken drumsticks and honey chilli potato for starters and both the dishes were awesome. Kids liked the chicken drumsticks and finished the plate. They were juicy and done to perfection and my girls told me that they were fresh also. Honey chilli potato was crunchy and sweet and chilly just like it should be.
For our main course we ordered veg dimsums and chicken dimsums and mix Chinese chopsuey. Both the dimsums were tasty and the wrapping was quite thin so you could taste the filling which was quite substantial. But I would recommend that you have dimsums with the sauce that they serve with honey chilly potato. I find it tastes better with this chilly sauce rather than the sauce that they serve with dimsums.
The mix Chinese chopsuey has a mix of egg, chicken and seafood and the girls told me that they liked the taste of it.
For dessert we tried chocolate fried ice cream which can be given a pass as I didn't like it that much.
Infact we liked the food so much that we got chilli garlic noodles packed for dinner also. And also the girls could not finish the chopsuey so we got it packed and will now have it in dinner.
We liked the place very much and once the husband gets back to Hyderabad we are visiting this place again for sure.

Pity Zomato doesn't give me chance to review the place on my second visit. Like I mentioned we would come back to this place we went there yesterday afternoon for some snacks and got some dinner packed for ourselves. We tried chilli garlic fish, kids' favourite chicken drumsticks again, chicken satay and lemon chicken coriander soup and veg talumein soup. All of which was great.
We asked for crispy chilly baby corn which turned out to be too salty and on complaining the stewardess served us a fresh batch which was quite tasty.
Definitely a must visit place. Will be back again when I am craving for some yummy Chinese food.

Dine O China,Uddipana Goswami,I went to this place as a part of our Sunday dinner. I already heard so much about this place from my friend. The taste of the food is no doubt good but I found stone in the soup I ordered. Thankfully it doesn‚Äôt go inside my stomach. Unfortunately no body bothers to say sorry they just gave 73 discount to us. The waiter was also very cunning first when we complained about the stone he said he will discount but later he came with the bill without discount. So we again asked him to give some discount then only he came up with new bill.,2,"10 Reviews , 13 Followers",8/13/2018 22:51,0,,"{'food': ['I went to this place as a part of our Sunday dinner.', 'The taste of the food is no doubt good but I found stone in the soup I ordered.'], 'drink': ['The waiter was also very cunning first when we complained about the stone he said he will discount but later he came with the bill without discount.']}"

When my friend arrived the staff at the kitchen told there is no ala-carte tonight. Only option is buffet. So they started with buffet. When I reached it a little surprise to me and I checked with the manager there Mr. Abhiveer. He also denied about the ala-carte. So we continued with buffet later while walking around the buffet spread we learnt that ala-Carte is also there and three ppl lied to us. As I am a big fan of their Hamas and pita dish I asked for the menu and Mr. Abhiveer is sayin we don‚Äôt have menu, please check the menu in Zomato. What? Who the hell ll publish the menu only on zomato in a restaurant and are the customers fool enough?

Buffet food options for vegetarians are very less. Their dessert spread was good though.

Their service was also pathetic for the indian bread and other stuff. After asking numerous time for spoons and tissues, this is how the tissues were served to us on the table (plz refer the pic). We had 3 kids with us, imagine how long these tissues would have been their in this manner! üòÄ

This place not just welcomes regular customers but make the leave a mark, literally. You'll find name plates of it's regular customers all over the bar. And their bartenders absolutely know how to keep the customers happy. This is one place where you will find more people sitting at the bar, rather than the regular seating arrangement it has.

Sonu being their star bartender, you'll find almost everyone calling him out for their drinks and he absolutely takes care of all his regulars with a smile. We usually order a whiskey sour and sangria, being our absolute favorite. Accompanied by crispy corn and their signature pizza, which is baked fresh out of their Jonathan's kitchen.

If you're a party animal you'll find this place a hit on Thursdays where they take their ladies night very seriously. All drinks on the house.

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rajat Goel ‚ú≥Ô∏è,"Komatose on a Sunday night is the perfect place to be, happened to be drizzling, which made for the perfect atmosphere to chill outside in the cabanas.

Inside was a pretty small area for a bar, but had loads of seating space which extended out to a floor above, overlooking the area below. Lighting was funky and great, the vibrant colors adding to the vibe. üíì

Being a big bunch, we ordered different drinks and luckily I got to taste all. The most special of these were from 'the 7 deadly sins of Koma' menu. The taste was as described on the menu. Lust in particular was something different I'd never tasted before, a chilli-spiced vodka, strawberry infusionüå∂Ô∏èüç∏.

The appetizers we had we're really good, something I enjoyed more than the alcohol.
Dragon prawnsüç§, Grilled pomfretüêü, Peshawar Chapali Kebabs are some of the must orders! Didn't quite like the Nawabi Shikhampuri. While all the items tasted great, I felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price.

Best for the last, not being a kid here, but the mocktails were just mind-blowing. Had a few different fruit flavors, peach, mango, green apple, lime, out of which the peach was the best. Multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush üçπ.

The service was professional and quick. Would've wished for better music, and there was no DJ at the music station. However we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great! It's a perfect place to watch a match screening, have a party, or if you're in the mood for it, go into 'Comatose' üòâ.

Coming to the food, after a long time I had a great Paav Bhaji. This was part of the live counters there. I hasked for some extra butter on paavs, to which the cook readily complied :D
Another live counter had paneer and veg rolls. Tried the paneer one, and liked it. For the mains, you have a lot of options to choose from. Do give the pizza a try.
The desserts are another wide spread. You find both desi and fancy desserts. I tried the blueberry cake, kiwi mousse, fruit cake, orange cake, brownie, burfi ‚Äî everything was so well done!

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Satwinder Singh,"Well next to Jonathans Kitchen is this place to down a few.
Komatose is a good crowd puller, with plenty of weekend party groups and people from nearby IT companies.
The team at the bar does a phenomenon job. Their interaction with guests is over the top, no wonder I heard of people visiting this place almost every day of the year.

Also, from my experience, this is one of those few places where the Sound Acoustics are so well designed that its loud yet comfortable. You will not come out with a sore throat.

The food comes from its sibling Jonathans Kitchen, so we know it can never go wrong. About the drinks, well what could go wrong with them ! ) and Oh ! did I mention the Cheese Chilli Toast.. Its Different.. Try it..

The outdoor cabanas can seat about 8 ~ 10 people each, wonderful for the evenings.

Great Music with shows on specific days of the week.

Aromas@11SIX,Priyank Almal,"This place is located in khajaguda. It used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste, quantity and pricing. I used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week.

Food is no doubt good..their soups, starters dal makhani, etc.. However there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden.

Prices have been almost doubled . I used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs.. I believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50% is really a good decision with no changes in ambience. ? I believe their main USP was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience.. Even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and Moti Mahal have lower prices and better ambience..

With hike in prices, customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience, fancy cutlery on the table .. well decorated tables , and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use, well dressed waiters.. etc..

Hope the management would rethink..",3,"7 Reviews , 6 Followers",5/5/2019 10:24,0,,"{'food': ['soups', 'starters', 'dal makhani'], 'drink': []}"
Aromas@11SIX,Onefussyfoodie,"This review was long due. Located on the Khajaguda Road this restaurant claims to be part of the Gachibowli cluster and when I asked the owner he said he was just on the edge of Gachibowli and, therefore, technically they are in Gachibowli. The place has good parking and nice natural setup which has still been maintained despite the recent road construction.

Coming to the food we went for the Gulaabi Chaap after checking on Google, unfortunately this is the only place in India that offers this dish and we had no clue about the dish until we got it. Simply put it was amazing, mild rose smelling chicken cooked in the tandoor and served with mint sauce. It gave a heavenly feeling. Next on the list was the Chicken Momo which was soft and fresh again reminded me of some amazing momos I had in Manali. I hope some day they make Mutton Momos as well.

Butter Chicken was by far the best in town which went very well with another amazing bread called the Malai Warki Paratha. It was soft and was melting in the mouth with the Butter Chicken. Seemed like a match made in heaven. Much said about the main course we went for their version of Special Biryani. As is known from my reviews I don't eat too spicy food and this was just the perfect spicy level one could ask for. It had boneless pieces of chicken pan fried and served on top of the Biryani Rice. The taste was good and to my liking. Our Vegetarians friends were enjoying their Daal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala which was again good and their Veg Biryani as per them was equally good.

Thanks to the friendly staff we went on eating for close to 2 and half hours without feeling the time passing by. The large projector added to the aura of the place and we enjoyed the IPL on the large screen. They offered us a 20% discount and another 10% on our next visit apparently one of their limited time running offer. Thank you aromas@11six for being such a good host and an amazing food.

Aromas@11SIX,Mithun Ravindranathan,"Review No 514: 
 
In my recent visit to Hyderabad, I was introduced to Aromas@11Six. While the name sounds interesting, but I was not able to find the reason behind their name. 

Our teams in Hyderabad have been ordering food from here for team events etc for quite some time and hence when we ordered food from here, I was keen to find out how they fared. 
 
Here's what we ended up ordering over a few days from Aromas@11Six 
 
Gosht Rogan Josh: What a beautiful preparation of spices and meat. The meat in specific was cooked very well and the spices were also within moderation. I usually get scared with the spice level in such dishes but Aromas@11Six got it absolutely right with this dish. 
 
Butter Rotis: Even when they were delivered to us at home and as well in the office, they were warm and soft. Nothing beats such a meal on an unusual cold Hyderabad winter evening. 
 
Paneer Butter Masala: The quality of the Paneer used was excellent. The quantity of the gravy and the paneer pieces were adequate. I loved the consistency of the gravy and the balance in the spices used.  
 
Dal Fry: Again, in many instances I have seen how it can go easily wrong with this humble dish. Thank you for serving this up well.  

Paneer Biryani: On of the days, I could not have non-veg food and ended up ordering their Paneer Biryani and it was filling to the core. The quality of the rice and preparation was nice. Thank you for not being stingy with the Paneer. 

See if you can check for some good combos on popular food app portals. That way you can try this great dish and club it with something else as well. 
 
Price: In line with the competition. They have tie ups with some of the popular food apps and hence sometimes we end up getting a good deal. 
 
Service: They have ensure we always got our orders within the stipulated time in spite of the rush in the orders (especially during dinner time). 
 
Ambience: We have only done take aways from here and hence going to leave this neutral. 

Here‚Äôs the final ratings basis my experience at Aromas@11six. I‚Äôm going to hold back a bit on the ratings because they have depth in their Menu and I would want to try them out more and perhaps revisit my ratings again in the near future.:

Food: 4/5 
Price: 4/5

This is the best and spiciest chicken kolhapuri I had in last 2 years.

The aroma was fantastic and was feeling great having this curry.

I can still feel it in my mouth... Kudos to the chef

Aromas@11SIX,Rupam Saha,"The ambience was good. We 12 ppl went there for dinner. Some of us ordered biriyani, some had kulcha nun with Kadai murg. For starters we all ordered chicken drumsticks. Starter was delicious but they didn't provide salad and sufficient chatney. For biriyani they took much time and at the end when we tasted it we felt disappointed. They told special chicken biriyani and mutton keema biriyani are their special dishes. But the rice was sour. With biriyani the gravy they provided didn't have any salt. May b they tried to compensate. One of my friends ordered jaljeera which was the most humorous and worthless thing they provided and it took 40 Rs.
And about the service, it was good till we pay the bill. Frankly speaking we found this restaurant from dine out app and we wanted to pay via that app. But they showed some vague reasons and showed reluctance to accept. Atlast though they agreed.

Ambience is spot on arabic, songs played are romantic. The guy who served us had a smile on his face all the time he's serving us. Nothing to complain about the place at the same time nothing to praise too.
We ordered bbq chiken mandi and grill fish..
Grill fish was oki dint like it much but my friend loved it.. She likes fish may be thats why!
BBQ chiken mandi was amazing i can place them in top 5 mandis in hyderabad..! Trust me with a lot of mandi places its a tough to be on top 5...Bbq chiken pieces wer juicy and very flavour full...they give you mayonise and chutney to go along!

The ambience is very spacious and resembles the Arabic style of interior decor and seating. This also has camel prototype placed in the entrance.

If you're a hater of sea food, you will start loving it after eating the Grill Fish Tikka from here.

Food we tried here:

Chicken BBQ Tikka
Grill Fish Tikka
Chicken Arabian Mix Mandi

All the 3 items that we tried here are the best of it's kind. Chicken BBQ Tikka is the best of the grilled chicken that I have tried before. Grill Fish Tikka comes with a single complete grilled fish without any bones. It just melts in your mouth and if you try it with white mayonnaise it tastes the best.

Chicken Arabian Mix Mandi comes with Arabian Mix Grill Platter. It's comes with a combination of Chicken Tikka, chicken wings, Grill Fish Tikka, Chicken BBQ Tikka and Mutton.

This was the best Mandi I ever had. It has rice cooked in Arabian style with Kaju, kishmish and fried onions sprinkled all over the rice. This combination of rice with grilled non-veg Tikka gives you a foodgasm. And also it easily serves for 4 to 5 people if you're on a very high appetite.

Service here is really good and cost is reasonable for all the items.

So, This place has an amazing ambience with dim Lighting, well equipped furniture & a large LCD screen & the light music just makes it perfect during a cricket match.

Well, Coming to food, I opted for a Veg buffet. The starters tasted really good specially the cheese garlic bread & ghee idly.

We had enough dishes in the main course & there were mocktails being served whenever asked, Raspberry tasted the best.

Deserts weren't that great. Vanilla scoops were just fine.

Overall, It seemed like a great place to hang out with a large crowd & also alone (Yes, for those cricket maniacs, you can just get yourself a beer & relax).

Either ways, it seemed at its best with proper space, lights, music & yaa, privacy.

We started with a mango mocktail called Mango Festival which was the best mango drink I've tasted.

Cajun spiceed Chicken was heavy on cajun spice and did not taste anything else.

Cheese Broccoli was an amazing dish. Both cheese a d Broccoli were fresh and were perfectly cooked.

The Cilantro Fish was another great starter where in meaty Basa chunks were marinated with coriander leaves a d cooked to perfection. No fish smell....that's it. It's a hit!

They have some interesting items on the menu that one wouldn't expect at a place like this.

Ghee fried idli was a surprise and was amazing! Highly aromatic d spicy idli pieces that just fill your mouth with flavours.

Peanut salad. Similar to roadside peanut chat that we get, in a fine dine form. The quantity is great and you just cant stop eating it.

In the main course, I ordered Lamb Chops. The chops were big and meaty but they could have been cooked better.

The grilled fish with rice was again an amazing dish with fresh grilled fish a d flavourful rice.

In the desserts, Cheesecake didn't impress me. They should start baking it.

While the newly opened micro-breweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently, TILT fills in the vacuum. It was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the Trappist monks. Also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !

We tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing Belgian Kreik, Chamborlette, La Trappe Witte, Dubbel, Erdinger Weisbier, Erdinger Dunkel and Schuimzuiper. Of these we liked the Dubbel, La Trappe Witte and the Erdinger Dunkel. They also serve a variety of mocktails, our favorite ones were Mint Mango and After Glow.

Their food menu compliments the beers very well. In appetizers we liked the Cajun Spice Grilled Chicken, Zesty Chicken Wings, Cilantro Grilled Fish, Cheese Broccoli and guess what, Spicy Fried Idly ! We were not expecting Spicy Fried Idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it, we understood why this was their most popular appetizer. We loved the Chicken Wings, they were at their juiciest best.

In the main course, we were served Grilled Fish with veggies and Lamb Chops with Rice & French fries, both the mains were great. In desserts, we had the Blueberry Cheese Cake and Choco Lava cake. While the Cheese Cake failed to impress us, the Choco Lava cake was finger licking good !

We ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of Smeets Waffle Jenever, it has a brilliant sweet after taste of Belgian waffles, a must try !

Overall TILT European Bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food.",5,"169 Reviews , 1261 Followers",2/26/2019 0:04,10,,"{'food': ['Cajun Spice Grilled Chicken', 'Zesty Chicken Wings', 'Cilantro Grilled Fish', 'Cheese Broccoli', 'Spicy Fried Idly'], 'drink': ['Mint Mango', 'After Glow']}"

The Tilt Bar Republic,Arjun,"I went there last night with a friend and had a pretty good experience. The place is on the second floor and you can view the traffic near the Biodiversity Park junction. It's not very crowded either and thus you're able to get a good amount of attention from the staff. They are courteous and efficient and if not sure they do check and come back with the right response.

They have a good variety of Tap Beers. We initially tasted the Chambourlette, La Trappe Witte, Schuimzuiper and Erdinger Weisbier. Chambourlette is very mild, slightly fruity too, La Trappe Witte was smooth, hada flavour of some good fresh spices and no bitter after taste, Schuimzuiper was a little bitter and Erdinger Weisbier was very mild. The obvious choice for us was La Trappe Witte.

For food, we ordered Nachos, Chicken Wings and Schezwan Paneer. Nachos was okay, basically it lacked topping. It looked as if the cheese was applied using a brush and the toppings were more like a garnish. Schezwan Paneer was amazing, the Paneer too had actually soaked the taste of the spices and was wonderful. For main course we ordered Veg Hakka Noodles, which was again prepared well and the noodles too were quite light.

The ambiance of this place is okay, the music is at the right volume and doesn't make you yell to talk. The place however is very dimly lit that your eyes strain while reading the menu as well. But overall a fairly good place to hangout with friends and quench your thirst.",4,"266 Reviews , 1559 Followers",1/13/2019 13:18,2,,"{'food': ['Nachos', 'Schezwan Paneer', 'Veg Hakka Noodles'], 'drink': ['Chambourlette', 'La Trappe Witte', 'Erdinger Weisbier']}"

The Tilt Bar Republic,Krishna Chaitanya,"‚Äú Must visit for Tap beer‚Äù

Went here on a Saturday evening for a couple of drinks and this place didn‚Äôt disappoint.

The place is a dimly lit bar scene overlooking the Biodiversity park signal, not crowded when we went there. We got ourselves into a table with good view of the city.

We tried Weissbeer and Mango Tango mocktail. The beer was a wheat beer, which has similar taste of a draught beer you usually get but it was different in a good way.Mocktail was pulpy and sweet. Overall Drinks were üëç

To go along with the drinks we ordered charcoal spiced chicken and a folded cheese omelette. The chicken starter was good with perfect amount of spice perfectly burnt to get that charcoal feel. The cheese omelette was just good with little cheese as my expectations were high. Overall Food was good.

The service was quick and prompt(maybe due to less crowd when we went) and no issues there.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place for a casual drinks night with friends or family.",4,"79 Reviews , 291 Followers",1/6/2019 2:17,0,,"{'food': ['charcoal spiced chicken', 'folded cheese omelette'], 'drink': ['Weissbeer', 'Mango Tango mocktail']}"

Went here with my pals.
We ordered Peri
- Peri Chicken pizza and Assorted Pizza.

Service: The waiters were courteous and gave a good suggestion on what to order and helped while splitting the bill as well.
The service wasn‚Äôt the quickest with around 6-8 people in the house.
Good parking available here.

Food: The pizzas were pretty mediocre. I liked the cheese quality and the toppings were in generous amount. We asked for a medium crust and the crust was a bit stiff.
Peri peri chicken was pretty good as the flavor was indulging.
The pizzas were missing the wow factor and wasn‚Äôt really specially.
My friends ordered pastas and wings.
Wings were pretty good and the pastas were less in quantity and wasn‚Äôt too good.

Ambience: It has dim low light and calm ambience with a street view and a music üéµ. Really liked the ambience and the decor as well. The tables were typically made out of moulded tin and gave a different feel and look.

Perfect place for Belgian Beer!!
I visited this place for Sunday Drunch(as they say it.. Breakfast+lunch+drinks).
It costs for Rs1000 per person inclusive of taxes which includes welcome drink, soup, starters, main course, dessert and 2 tap beer of your choice.
I loved their hospitality.. For welcome drink they asked our choice and prepared it fresh.

In soup they had Hot and sour which was yummy.

In starters they provided 6-7 differnt varieties which included crispy corn, paneer tikka, garlic bread etc.

Coming to the main course they had limited menu with Dal Fry, Dal Makhani, Mix veg, Paneer korma, Naan, chapati, curd, fryums and 3 kinds of salad.

They also cooked white sause paste just for us!!

In Desserts, they had walnut cake, cutfruits, gulab jamun, shahi tukda, icecream and chocolava cake.

Drinks we asked for was Belgian Kriek, Erdinger dunkel and Schzuimzuiper.

Desserts were kind of okay.. so my suggestion is to make them better..

The Tilt Bar Republic,Kamal Sardiwal,"TILT BAR or EUROPEAN BAR? 

I was surprised to hear of Belgian beers being served in here. They are served nowhere else across India.

From Bitter to Spicy Sweet, the options in imported beers are available in heaps. La Trappe Trappist is one of the most recommended beers in here endured through 600 years old history of Monks brewing it.

For those who like it sweet, you should try Belgian Kriek. Taste is perfectly balanced with rich sweetness giving it a fresh finish without the bitter aftertaste.

No beer belly!

Beer hunters, this is the right place to rejoice if you are after some exotic beer.

Must try bottle beers!

I'll let you in a little secret - ASK FOR THE DESSERT OF DRINKS (Smeets Waffle Jenever Shot) AND DON'T YOU MISS!

Mocktail:

After glow - An amalgamation of fresh fruits mixed with mint and topped with litchi grape juices.

Starters I'd recommend:

Chicken Wings, Stuffed mushrooms and Cheese broccoli

Mains:

Honey glazed lamb chops served with fries and rice. The rice flavour should be enhanced with an increase in quantity. 

Desserts:

Blueberry cheesecake. It stands out from the rest I have had at other places.

The staff is amicable and polite. Swift service provided.

Live music available as well. Music system needs to be improved as the audio quality of vocalist sounds completely distorted.

The Food, ambiance, service is exceptionally good but what really stands out is their beers.

The liquor section Of Tilt is hands down the most rare one, I say this cause of the beers they offer. I am not a beer person but here the beers are like nothing I've had before.

The beers are imported from different parts of the world and specially from those areas cause you wouldn't get the taste elsewhere.

The Tilt Bar Republic,Tornadointhekitchen,"Lovely European Bar with probably the best drinks hyderabad has to offer (No exaggeration)

Most of the drinks they have are imported from Europe and are supposedly not found any where else across India.

They also serve Trappist beers which are basically drinks brewed by monks for a charitable cause
And they also claim that all their booze is glycerine free without any preservatives and won't give you a beer belly

Everything aside they officially serve the smoothest drinks in town and I can vouch for that!!!! They're pricey but worth it!!!

Drinks-
Beer: La trappe Trippel (Bottled)

Belgian Kreik
Chamborlette
Erdinger Weisbier
Erdinger Dunkel
Schuimpzuiper
Miss spicy - They mean it when they say spicy
Barbar blond (bottled)

Jenever shots (Pronounced yenever) (20% alcohol)
A type of Dutch Gin produced only in Europe with juniper flavour

These were absolutely amazing
The smoothest shots I've ever had

Smeets bessen Jenever - fruity gin with a sweet base
Citroen Jenever- Citrus flavoured shots with a tangy, zesty taste
Wafel Jenever- Hands down the best shot I've had. Ever.
Tastes like waffle syrup. Notes of caramel and pop corn. Sweet, smooth and simply sublime

Project 51- Brandy cocktail with notes of cinnamon and spicy jalapenos

Mango mint mocktail- Super sweet mango flavoured drink with a mildly minty taste

Food

Food was pretty good. We tried
Lasooni Murgh
Lamb chops - Tender and well cooked
Fries

Florentine saute mushrooms
Chickpea corn masala - Good stuff to munch on while having drinks. Had alot of Peanuts.
Cilantro grilled fish- Tasted pretty Indian

We tried the Egg Manchuria was pretty unique and then it was the Spicy Fried Idli was off beat
The Chicken tikka was standard

A little spicy on your pocket, but what the heck a few beers don‚Äôt harm..

Although the service could have been a little more prompt.

See the TILT in the Beer ;)  !!

The Tilt Bar Republic,Gourav Bhattacharya,It was almost after an decade I landed in Hyd and Zomato came in rescue for my Saturday night. I always feel the substance of the place is paramount and Tilt Bar won't dissapoint you. CraftB served here is smooth as the breeze and i got so drenched till the closing. Erdinger beer matched my DNA and with amazing pizza and garlic bread spread with cheese ball must for Vegetarian's. Lamb served was good and so was chicken.

The Tilt Bar Republic,Marsha,"I went to this place for a date and absolutely loved it. The layout , lighting, music is perfect for a romantic dinner. Even if you are with friends and don't want to miss out an important match this is a very nice place for good food, good company and the Indian team on a large screen :P. The staff is very very good (one of the best) .For the two of us they found a cosy corner where we would get some quietness yet not miss the match.When we were undecided about what to order, one of them politely suggested a Fish dish and that turned out to be oh so tasty! Cilantro fish is a must try here. I could have easily had another plate.The softness..the perfect marination..the taste of coriander...i loved it.Then i ordered the Non veg platter and I had wished i had just taken another suggestion :(. I didn't like prawn tempura at all.Pepper chicken,Soya chilli lamb and sesame fried fish were okayish.
For drinks again we turned to the waiter and he was again bang on with his choices.He got me a Belgian Kriek which is white beer based drink with the blend of cherry juice.I loved the tanginess followed by rich sweetness that lingers on in the mouth. My friend tried Erginder Dunkel - this is a wheat beer with delicate roasting aromas.I took a sip and liked it but i liked mine better.:P. Then came the best part of our dinner - the choco lava cake! The ice cream served in a seperate bowl and the brownie filled with chocolate syrup which oozes out when you cut it.Complete foodgasm!

Beers with fancy names and glasses was an attraction but that was the only point of attraction and the taste was a big let down. They don't have an in-house brewery but beers are imported as they claim and very costly too. In comparison to it, there are a lot of places to try in-house brewed beers like OTM brewery etc.
Even their food menu is so limited and we tried their chicken pizza and it was one of the worst tasting pizza I had in a long time, just chicken pieces and no other topping at all at 450 Bucks. Similar experience with fish and chips, the batter was running away from the fish and it was over fried and was more or less feels like eating chips then fish.
Really a disappointing experience and more disappointing as I went with high hopes.

The Indi Grill,Satyadivyak,"Went with our friends for a casual lunch on Friday
As usual it was Soo rush and waiters and staff over there are in hurry to serve us fast and want to throw us out of the restaurant.üòê
Yeahh it‚Äôs fine we can understand but there should be a polite way to convey the same,it should not be like ur time is done..leave now..leave now...
That is a negative of the management over there.
Coming to the food
For veg..the starters are only 3....potato..crispy corn and mushroom and on the grill pineapple and paneer. Not a worthy starters for veg
For non veg...starters were good..there are all varieties of non vegetarian on grill and served in plates
Main course...Not at all worthy...and not tasty..ü§¢
Only one rice item..tasteless and curries and other items were not tasty
Salads were good
Chat items not worthy
Deserts are good..3 desi sweets and as usual pastries cakes and pudding
And lastly the people working over there forces us to give 5 rating on zomato even before we complete our lunch and leave out.
They want us to give the rating infront of them

The best part is they mention the name and place allocated on the entrance.

Ambiance is good and they welcomed with a mocktail.

Coming to starters, non veg was awesome and veg starters looked quite ok. But they can introduce something new as its same everywhere.

We have chicken wings, chicken kabab, fish, prawns. They were just amazing.

We have Tawa chicken and Prawns but that was not up to the mark and that Tawa items needs a huge change in taste.

Main course was above average and they had some amazing dishes like Laal Maas(mutton), prawns were awesome(love to visit again to eat this amazing prawns)

Coming to Desserts, they were just melting in mouth, my all time favourite Jilebi with Rabdi, asked for some hot Jilebi at the end as well, I got a few.
Kheer was ok, gulab jamun was good.

Overall experience is good. It needs some minor changes in few dishes.

Combine this with courteous staff who ensure you have a good time right from the moment you step in and you have the perfect experience.

I would recommend visiting the place in the first slot, as things are reasonably quiet. Not surprised at all that the second slot starts getting crowded!

The Indi Grill,Santosh Pappachan,"This is located prominently along the main road and is a part of the same group which has the Moti Mahal chain of restaurants.

Hopped in for lunch on a weekday after a movie at the nearby mall and it was a good experience to put it across in a lucid manner. The starters have mostly the usual fare you'd see in a typical barbeque restaurant. There was chicken, fish, prawn, mutton seekh kebab, chicken tangdi, chicken meat balls etc. in the non veg fare. The veg had the typical paneer, pineapple, corn on the cob, crispy potatoes in sauce which I would say were delectable along with the crispy corns. There is a complimentary mocktail which was decent but the masala coke I ordered later had too much masala and too little fizz for my liking.

The chats were toothsome and lip smackingly tasty. I also liked the kulchhas and parathas in the main course. They were soft and had the right texture and taste. Just the way they should be. Special mention of the veg and non veg manchow soup which was appetizing. My wife had multiple rounds of the same. The chicken, fish and mutton curries were good but I liked the dal makhni and matar methi malai among the lot. The gulab jamun and halwa along with the jalebi and rabdi were supremely delicious in the desserts section.

The service was quick and prompt. Special mention of Raghuveer Singh who took care of our requirements and was always available when required. This is not a big place hence the ambiance is not much to talk about. They have seating on the first floor too which is an added bonus.

Fresh minced mutton made into soft kebabs tasted amazing
And crabs were little but slow cooked and prepared in such a way that the flesh comes off easily tasted amazing
