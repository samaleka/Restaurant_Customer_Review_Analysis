Yesterday ordered for one portion of puri-choley and one portion of puri-alu. The puris were fat and oily. The alu curry was more like hing(asafoetida) Curry and had to dig through the gravy for choley. Our breakfast was definitely spoiled. In my last order of Rajma-chawal, same thing had happened. I really had to search for the rajmas in the gravy.

On My Plate: Buttery Aloo Paratha||Paneer Makhani||Raita

The Paratha that you see is just one half of the entire paratha. So imagine how ginormous is. The stuffing was perfect, neither too less, nor too much.

The valet parking was a relief.
Unfortunately there was no maitre'd and we had to seat ourselves.
The ambience was great - I loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening.

The food was really good. The sushi (even the veg variant) was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb.

Service however was lacking on all parameters. It was cold and inefficient. It was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did, they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out (couple of women in particular - could not catch their names). The billing too took an unreasonable amount of time.

The food here is great, but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3. Quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant.

Still no questions asked on why we're leaving. I guess one can plan a visit if they have a lot of time in their hands and or are not hungry.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,IStay,Did not enjoy our evening at all. Just realised not to order Sushi if it's not an authentic Japanese restaurant. Nigiri and uramaki were rice and rice and rice.. I made it a little interesting by adding as much wasabi as my brain could take. Waiters were very transactional. Told them it's my daughter's birthday and asked for a cake. They had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that's all they can offer. We'll ordered the cake and had her cut it. None of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. Why do I bring this up? Cos this is a 3-4 star hotel and the staff is expected to be well trained and courteous.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sana Ahmed,"A peaceful n quite place is something u want after a hectic schedule where u can spend some quality time with friends or family that relaxes u for sometime.....even I wanted to relax n take a break from my hectic schedule.......one or two days later few of my friends invited me to this place n was delighted to know this place n it was perfect for me as I exactly wanted to head to a place similar to this......believe me guyz it's an awsome place n definitely u will fall in love with it.......

LETS begin with drinks first

They served so many MOCKTAILS like

ORANGE DELIGHT had amazing blend of vit C to give u the boost in this hot weather

CUCUMBER n MINT very refreshing to beat the heat n taste was good too

VIRGIN PINA COLADA not good as it had coconut n pineapple flavor n I'm not a fan of coconut flavor especially in drinks,so it was a No No for me

BLACK CURRANT tasted good

SPICY TANGO had a tinge of masala like jaljeera n a dash of spiciness dat had a pinching sensation on the throat.....little different n can be taken

BLUE LAGOON as the name says it's a blue colored drink dat had blue caracao syrup added with few lemon wedges n mint leaves.....tasted realllllyyy good

FOOD

GRILLED POMFRET
a big fat good looking pomfret😋 marinated with an awsome blend of very basic n flavorful spices n grilled to perfection....served with mint yogurt dip along with onion rings n lemon wedges.......fish was full of flavors with each bite giving superb taste n it was fresh as the taste of fish meat was very good n not at all smelly......well presented n delicious👌

CHILLI CHICKEN
Chunks of boneless chicken coated with batter n fried till golden brown,tossed in a chilli soy based sauce with onion,cubed capsicum,dry red chillies n spring onion stalks topped with handful of cashews n raw cabbage.....overall tasted very good n chicken was perfectly cooked n the sauce that was coating it was fab too...

CRISPY CORN
Crunchy corn topped with some garlic n onions is the best of anything that one could possibly desire for........ if you love crispy corn then u you cannot miss this.....it was a fantastic appetizer to start our meal with.......do not miss this guyzz 👍

THAI BASIL CHICKEN WINGS
When chicken wings are coated in a delicious schezwan style thai chilli garlic sauce with a touch of basil leaves u get an awsome result.....it was very different kinda wings which we don't usually get at other places.......delicious

CHICKEN WONTON
Minced chicken filling wrapped in wonton sheets served with sweet chilli dip......filling had a quite dominant flavor of vinegar otherwise it was fine.....

NAWABI SHIKAMPURI KEBAB
Usually shikampur is flat round shape n filled with yogurt,but here it was in a round ball shape filled with yogurt n onion dip.....shikampur was cooked very well n was going very well with the mint sahi chutney n onions on the side...

DRAGON PRAWNS
Crispy fried prawns tossed in red chili n garlic sauce

BUTTER GARLIC PRAWNS
By far one of the best butter garlic prawns I had till now.....crispy fried prawns tossed in a velvety buttery n garlicky sauce with onions n spring onion stalks topped with sesame seeds n raw cabbage......👌

TIGER PRAWNS
Jumbo is also a small word to describe the size of these prawns....whoa mahn!!!!
Tiger prawns was the right name given to this dish as the prawns sized huge....tossed in a very basic garlic,salt n pepper sauce served on a bed of blanched spinach topped with lemon wedge.....it was a bit hard but other than that the flavors were good

DAL TADKA
Well blended with perfect tempering of dry red chillies,chopped garlic,cumin seeds n oil.....was one of my favorite from the main course items.....delicious

RARA GOSHT
Minced meat gravy dat was delicious n spices did not overpower the whole dish which was the best part of this dish

BUTTER NAAN n AMRISTSARI KULCHA tasted yummmmm

BURNT FRIED RICE WITH SCHEZWAN CHICKEN GRAVY
This combo can never go wrong.....both the dishes complimented each other n it tasted fab!!!

DESSERTS

GULAB JAMUN
Perfect rounds of gulab jamun served with sugar syrup n sprinkled with chopped almonds wer yummmmmm
Perfectly cooked with just the right color

CREME BRULEE
It consists of a rich custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar....... it was served slightly chilled topped with plenty of fruit cuts n presented with apple slices by the side.......
It was different from other places n tasted yummm

CHOCOLATE FONDANT WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM
When a warm choco lava cake is topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with loadz of chocolate sauce n dusted with powdered sugar den there is nothing else u want in ur life😋

SERVICE was on point.....staff was very polite n humble
Delivered each n every item with punctuality n was never rude even if we asked something too many times....good team

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Anita Majhi,"I love the food here they have a great spread for their buffet. However I have never had the buffet so I wouldn’t comment on the taste, but the spread is definitely good cz I checked that out. I come here and order right out of the menu and over time have fallen in love with their Fish items from the grill section. I have had the Blackened salmon steak, Cilantro Fish and the Murrel Crust and have loved each one. However, if I had to pick one it would be the Salmon and that too would win by a very close margin. Apart from their fish I love their Spring Chicken and Chicken Confit as well. If you love grilled meat that is cooked delicately in continental cooking style, then this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit.

Coming to the ambiance, it’s minimalistic and chic. The staff is polite and warm. They have a Zomato gold offer on food, so that’s amazing because the food is a little on the pricier side. I definitely plan to have their buffet soon and will update this post accordingly.",5,"21 Reviews , 58 Followers",3/28/2019 14:30,2,,"{'food': ['Fish', 'Spring Chicken', 'Chicken Confit'], 'drink': []}"

Dessert- I went their only for dessert once and had Tiramisu and chocolate ganache...both of them tasted amazing...except Tiramisu base was little watery after sometime but still it managed to satisfy my craving.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Foodbite,"Best place Ever Jonathan's Kitchen

If you are near Gachibowli and are planning to have a perfect lunch or dinner so I recommend you the best place is Jonathan's kitchen, where you can visit with your family and friends. I really loved this place from it’s ambiance to food and service, everything’s top notch.

It was Wednesday night and we were near Gachibowli and really hungry, when I suggested we will visit Jonathan's Kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. I was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters Grilled Pomfret, Chili chicken , Crispy Corn , Chicken Wings, Nawabi shikampuri kebab, Dragon prawns and Tiger prawns. All of the starters were the best, I have never tried such before anywhere. Now that the starting was the best, I promise at the end it will be a blast.

Grilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. It was so good! Chili chicken wasn’t much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. Crispy corn I have tried at many restaurants and I loved Flechazo’s before, but now I can say the best crispy corn is at Jonathan's kitchen. I think this is the best compliment. Chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!

Then my favorite part were the prawns. Here we tried 3 different types of prawns, Butter Garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, Dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, Mr. Tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. It is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, Tiger prawns; these were too large in size, I have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.

Then we ordered some mocktails because it’s mandatory; Orange delight ,Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada ,Black current, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. Every mocktail has their own specialty. Orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. Black current is really good in taste and refreshing. Spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. Every mocktail is best at Jonathan's kitchen.

Then it’s time for main course, in that we ordered Dal Tadka and Rara Gosht with Butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha, and Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. Every dish just left us speechless! Dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at Jonathan's kitchen.

But without dessert, I never end my dinner. So here we ordered Gulab jamun, Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and Cream brulee with Fresh fruits. All the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.

Thanks to Mr. Rashid for the lovely dinner at Jonathan's kitchen. Thanks to the entire team of Jonathan's kitchen who served us in a very good way and special thanks to Surrender and Chef vijay.

Huge disappointment this one was.Been here for lunch on holiday,even though i made a reservation before hand it took 30 min for us to get a table.Service, i always let go even if the service is not uptothemark cause it's understandable and afterall they are human.This one was unacceptable.It was a buffet(everything selfservice) only thing they are supposed to do was provide cutlery which they failed even after asking for multiple times.I walked upto the cutlery table to get it myself and they gave me 2 spoons and one plastic spoon for a table of 6.😂The taste of the food in the buffet,total off.Below average spread and taste.Nothing caught my attention to even write about it.The kebabs were all dry,the classic crispy corn was rock hard .The fish curry,i think they accidentally put fish in the salt gravy.Why is it so hyped,i still don't get it.May be i visited this on restaurent's bad day.But it was a bad lunch day for me and my friends.We just know how to have fun in the crisis,good for us,otherwise you can land up in a huge disappointment.",2,"85 Reviews , 673 Followers",3/24/2019 14:34,0,,"{'food': ['buffet'], 'drink': []}"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Mohammed Asim Khan,"One of Hyderabad's most stylish fine dining places, Jonathan's Kitchen serves lip-smacking culinary delights paired up with a cool and extensive bar menu. The luxurious ambiance and enchanting music make this place an ensemble of various occasions. I was here for a Tuesday night dinner with some friends and we experienced a flavorful time.

We started off with some amazing starters; Butter Garlic Prawns, Grilled Pomfret, Dragon Prawns, Crispy Corn Pepper Salt, Chicken Wonton and Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab. The Prawns were just fabulous, they were a perfect start to our dinner. Grilled Pomfret was also very good. Crispy Corn were the best that I've ever had, they've topped my last best opinion. Chicken Wonton had a perfect crisp covering and the filling was really great. Lastly, the Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab were very juicy and succulent.

Next we had some of the finest mocktails; Orange delight, Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada, Black currant, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. All of these were very refreshing and perfect to have before moving onto the main course, while still enjoying the appetizers. Although Virgin Pina Colada wasn't that great, and Orange Delight the best.

We had an array of dishes from the main course, starting off with the ambrosial Chateaubriand, tenderloin cooked medium rare and served with creamy spinach and mushroom cream. It is a high end dish, and it did keep it's name.

Then we savored Rara Gosht and Dal Tadka curries with Butter Naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Both curries were absolutely delectable and were a divine treat to our taste buds. Lastly, we had Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. This was an absolute favourite of all, a tempting and toothsome Chinese dish with succulent chicken crispy on the outside juicy inside, slathered with a hot sweet uniquely spicy and sticky Indo Chinese schezwan sauce that just made our night.

We ended our dinner with the most sumptuous desserts; a classic Gulab Jamun, a fruity Creme Brulee, and a luscious Chocolate Fondant Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. A perfect end to an amazing dinner.

They will stay at the corner and chit chat each other. There was a lady I said ur servicing was very worst and smiled in sarcastic way and went off. They will replace items after 20min. We have to wait for that item. Even bowls for sweets they will bring after half an hour that too not more than 5. At last I feed up with the services and had thought to have sweet and I find an Cockroache in the bowl I called the lady and waiter they did not responded. Then I went to kitchen and called a person ranjith he took the bowl and went inside the kitchen and came back and said sorry and offered 5 Ice creams. We were around 30 people. And he saying to come in the evng or next day. I don't know what they think about the customers. Basically it looks like decent and star hotel but the people and the service just like irani cafe. At least in cafe if we order they will get it fast or else inform us if it late. I heard lot about Jonathan kitchen food is absolutely good.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Suraj Soni,"Writing this review for so called much hyped restaurant of Hyderabad- Jonathan's kitchen

Went to celebrate my bday today..It was the worst food buffet I ever had in any above average costly restaurant.They charge so high for this shitty buffet.

1. Ambience- Even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall. No theme no decoration
2. Service- No serving of starters, no serving of even water until u ask,no serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here.
3. Food- The worst part of it..Some stale starters of chicken and fish. Veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days old.One chicken starter only had some taste. Main course is also pretty below average.Pasta is good.Pizza(so called best Hyderabadi pizza) was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza.
Deserts- they put some sweets of local shops as deserts.
Two juices as welcome drinks were Ok.

I gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday.Thanks for that.

Dahi ke Kababs were very nice and soft like they should be. Thai Basil Prawns were also nice and tasty. They were properly cooked and well served. Fresh lime soda was.....well fresh lime soda but Strawberry Mocktail was super sweet and is a must try. Penne Arrabiata pasta is one dish that I would recommend you all to try here.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Khaane_mey_kya_hey By Rony Samuel,"When you are in Gachibowli and have to make a quick descision for a team dinner/lunch or a buffet place..!! Jonathan's kitchen would be on the top of my list.

Been here twice (this time on birthday) :-p and never regretted the service or food, with live music(they do have a good taste for music) and courteous staff, this place is always buzzing and is on the roll.

checkout offers on buffet and you can strike a good deal if you have a large team visiting, amazing seating options indoors and outdoors,cool bar and buffet counter ,love their starters and live counters with really good varieits and options to choose from!!

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,ARYAN JHA,"Ambience: 5/5 (Both Indoors and Outdoors facility)
Value for Money: 3.5/5 (This is with respect to Sunday Brunch# costing Rs. 1200/- per person)
Staff Service: 5/5

Quality of Food: 5/5 Simply premium.Items I like the most are veg. maki (sushi), broccoli salad* from their regular menu.But even more outstanding are their live counter options such as Tawa Fish (Not your regular bland bone-less fish, but the way you eat fish at home) had some real flavour. Omelette, French toast, Pancakes were simply brilliant.
Variety of Food: 5/5 Enormous.This is where Jonathan's Kitchen truly excels, there has to be at least one item you will madly fall in love with. They claim to have over 60 items on their menu, which can be verified rather immediately upon looking at the serving table.
#In the name of unlimited drinks, there was no real variety to choose from. I couldn't even get my favourite soft drink Thums up (Franchise issue probably, I know), and on that particular day, there wasn't any option of Pina Colada.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rajjit Das,"I went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Four of us were there for lunch, out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for à la carte. I was among the two who went for à la carte. For the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band. The ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded, they offer open air seating as well. The starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor. Personally, I felt the seating isn't much comfortable as the chairs' backrest lacked comfort. The air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn't as comfortable as I expected it to be. However, the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can.
Coming to the food, I had ordered Mutton Sukha, Rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns. My companions went for the sunday brunch, as they told me the non-vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless. All the starters were very well balanced in flavour, the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite. Compared to the starters, the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing. Prawn cocktail was outstanding, the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet. Coming to the à la carte menu, the Mutton Sukha was great in every way, the spices were perfectly balanced they weren't overpowering the flavour of the meat, it's definitely a must try there. The rib eye steak didn't impress me much, the meat wasn't juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing. On the other hand, the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant, they were served on a bed of sautéd spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour.
Overall, it's a great place to visit which serves dishes from all the major cuisines around the world.",4,"17 Reviews , 399 Followers",3/1/2019 20:11,2,,"{'food': ['Mutton Sukha', 'Rib eye steak', 'Grilled tiger prawns'], 'drink': []}"

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Hungry Eyes,"This review has been long overdue, I visited this place for my birthday and gawd I wasn’t disappointed at all !! The place has this really sophisticated minimal design which isn’t too catchy but kinda looks like an elite ball room dining room.
The service is just amazing ! Every staff member that approaches the table knows the menu in and out, the warmth that they have just gives this place extra points.
Now coming to the main aspect of this restaurant; the food. The food is as authentic as it can get and this goes for every cuisine that the restaurant offers be it Mediterranean or Italian as a matter of fact even Indian.
Now I don’t want to go into detail with all that I ordered and describe it, I’ll attach images with this review and I’ll let the images talk for themselves albeit I’d like to describe a few dishes because those dishes deserve credit- to begin with I’d like to talk about the pizza, this was one of the finest pizzas I’ve ever had in Hyderabad, drizzled with a tad bit of olive oil and perfectly seasoned.
Moving forward I’d like to talk about the mutabak, the chef had taken pedantic efforts to make this dish as authentic as it could get, I’d have to give him brownie points for his painstaking ability to make this dish, the omelet was perfectly cooked and not crisp like the replicas of mutabak that are available in other so called Mediterranean restaurants. The carbonara was perfectly cooked, in the Italian way, the black pepper that stuck on each piece of pasta just showed how well versed the chef was with this recipe.
To summarize this I’d say yes this place is a must visit and I’d definitely recommend it for any formal or casual occasion be it birthdays or cooperate dinners, this place is the place to be !!",5,"104 Reviews , 5129 Followers",2/17/2019 13:02,4,,"{'food': ['pizza', 'mutabak', 'omelet', 'carbonara'], 'drink': []}"

surprisingly the entire place was empty and we were the only customers there

so, it was a very cozy comfy yummy and lovely experience.

the food was good, service was ok (surprisingly!!!), price is also okish

rating - 3 * coz the waiters/servers who were COMPLETELY free n unoccupied were continously busy huddling up in a corner n chatting with each other, i thought i would be getting that attention since i was the only customer there but sadly no. they were enjoying the free time rather than provide some excellent service.

Food not satisfied.
My review is only on vegetarian food.
Starters:
There were 5 veg starters. 2 paneer, crispy corn, cheese poppers and mixed veg. Crispy corn was disappointing and others were good.
Live counter:
Dosa was OK and Gobi paratha was good.
Main course:
I couldn't taste noodles as the dish was not refilled even after waiting for sometime.
All the gravy items were OK.
Deserts:
The dishes were Mysore Pak, kaaja, banana in hot jaggery liquid, kaju burfi, one type of laddu, apple crunch, answer kalakand.
Kaju burfi had more sugar and others were ok. When I called to the restaurant they said that they will have approximately how 100 items but I couldn't find even 40 vegetarian items there. I booked buffet in dineout offer. So, it was good deal for me.

I specifically wanted to try out the Sushi (Veg) in this place. I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available. In any case, I ordered a stater (shanghai rolls) which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself & wife and a pizza for my daughter. The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto (my fav place for asian cuisine). The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city. I also tried their creme brulee (best of the lot) which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping. In my opinion, they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself. I would have rated it 3.5 but for their really slow service (and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings). 

All in all, an average place to try out. I might go back to try some of their other items on the menu.

Went for Grill and Chill on Saturday night... Not a fun experience by any stretch of the imagination....

Ambience - it's ok... Nothing spectacular... Chairs weren't very comfortable and unsuitable for a relaxed dining experience...

Service - this is the truly sad part. Really slow service and servers are uninterested. This really hurt the experience and is unacceptable from a star property.

Food - starters were 4 varieties of chicken, 2 varieties of fish and 1 prawns.... The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka was nice... But unfortunately everything was served cold.... You ask for hot starters and you get cold starter's again...

Main course had lamb korma which was the best thing for the evening... Chicken curry was decent... Desserts were ok as well...

Overall, the buffet was extremely unimaginative and below average. Barbecue nation does a much better job!

The best part - they gave tissues instead of regular napkin ... And plastic spoons for dessert!! Pathetic!!!

VFM - Rs. 3000 for 3 people... And you get paper napkins and plastic spoons for dessert... I'm glad they didn't give us paper plates lol

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Ambience, service and location of this place is spot on..
Choice of menu is less and am sure they are clear about their strengths and they have curated the menu accordingly. Right balance of Indian, Chinese, etc
We ordered a Chicken starter which is very flavourful from the first bite and meat is juicy, succulent and fresh.
Chicken noodles is very subtle and at the same time very tasty.. Noodles looked freshly boiled and the veggies are as fresh as they can be.. :D You won't get this kind of flavour and taste to the noodles at many places.
Tried sushi for the first time.. It was served with a green pickle which is super spicy (a pinch of it can actually make you cry) and pickled ginger.. felt sushi is not made for my palate.. :D forgot to mention had hard time to eat with chopsticks.. finally had with fork and spoon.. LOL..

No fight or waiting to get place near to the screen.

We went here during IPL screening.

I went on a special day , so there was a live music band playing. But it was too loud. So the brightness and the loud music didn't do justice to so much as setting the mood.

Food was ok, taste wise. But price was on the higher side. Limited variety of food. But they have done some nice experiments with the wings. So , try worthy.

But there are very nice people working there. Very friendly, Nice staff. Service was very good.

Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

The service was fine like any other party place had and the taste of food was also decent. Even though we were 9 people, they allowed us to use 6 Zomato golds and I really appreciate it☺️

We had veg spring rolls, veg manchurian and chicken balls. All were great and I have ordered Long Island Iced tea which they made perfect.

On Wednesdays they have a guest DJ Maddy who plays super awesome tracks and in house DJ Akso is great too.

All the best guys.....keep rocking 👍

The place is dimly lit, but I guess that is on purpose to set up the mood and if you are a party animal you are most surely going to get engrossed by the music in no time. The DJ plays all the trending tunes and it is sure to make you sway. The staff is courteous and prompt , despite the high density of crowd that gathers here during weekends. The food is quite affordable and also appeals to the taste buds at the same time. I have visited this place 3-4 times and have never been disappointed.

We ordered :

Jalapeno Cheese poppers - 4/5 - Yummy cheese filled balls with right amount of spices and jalapenos.

Aloo Pakode - 3.5/5 - Pretty normal with a homely taste to it

I was allowed after they realized that one of my other friends was already inside the pub and taken the table. It was so frustrating that treating someone so unprofessional and with a rude behavior. If you don't want to allow stag ...say it straight forward or put a notice outside so that no stag would even wish to enter. Don't change your rules according to your convenience.

SHIT-FIT – So Happy Its Thursday cuz Friday Is Tomorrow..!!

While we hit the weekend and everyone looking at places to hang out, I would like to share my recent experience with TiKi Shack - Rooftop Bar, Gachibowli where I have organized my team party which can serve you as a recommendation if still planning .. Such a pulsating décor they got especially the blazing umbrella shaped roofing that sets the party vibe and takes you on. Their open rooftop gives a great evening view over food and drinks. This place can accommodate up to 200-300 pax (both sitting and standing crowd). Unlike many places around Gachibowli, Tikki Shack has got reasonable pricing (cost for 2 at 800-1000INR including alcohol) which answers the overcrowded weekends of this place. No Separate dance floor but the place opp to the bar counter turns out to be, after a while when the spirits go high.

We negotiated for a party package which needs a minimum of 20-25 pax to accommodate with at least 1 day prior notice/reservation priced at 1100 per person all-inclusive (has the flexibility to customise package and price depends accordingly). The menu includes Unlimited 3 Veg and Non-veg starters, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Pizza, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Biryani, 2 desserts, three varieties of mocktails (for teetotalers), draught beer/kingfisher ultra/premium (for people who drink). With least expectation, food esp starters turned out to be outstanding. Full house and the service was still attentive needs a special Mention.

Overall a satisfactory experience and I would highly recommend this place for all kinds of parties.

Kindly bare with the poor photography.

Starters [chilli chicken, fries, cheese poppers, some fish] were fine but nothing extra-ordinary, ambience was a bit crazy with random groups dancing here & there, DJ was average, Biryani was good I heard but did not try it myself.

Off lately, like from 4 weeks or so, whenever I ask for the beer of my choice(KF Ultra or KF Draught), you guys just bluntly tell me that it's not available. Once, I've asked Karan directly and he told me that they'd be available only during the weekdays. I've visited this place today i.e. Wednesday and it's the same story, again! I'm forced to order Heineken or Bira. The worst part was when I was about to push off after our hangout, I've seen almost everyone inside drinking towers of Draught beer and when I've asked, they just ignored and didn't even care to respond. Like really? Speaking on everyone's behalf, it could be a budget constraint or someone's personal preference of beer, but not providing equal service to every customer is unprofessional and I'm really disappointed this time.

3. BHEJ MANCHURIAN - Veg dry manchurian balls which were amazing!

4. JALAPENO CHEESE POPPERS - Unlike other jalapeno cheese poppers i've tasted elsewhere, these weren't very dry and bland. Also, good accompanying dip

5. ALOO PAKODE - aloo bhajiyas! Loved them! :D

We were escorted by one of the tiki shack staff and asked to sit on a 8 seater table
After 15 mins another staff member came and asked us to move to another smaller table (meant for 5 pol max) when we asked for reason he was super rude and said this is Friday night and we will accommodate 20 ppl like you on this 8 seater table

I was shocked by this behaviour because we booked in advance before going there and i was ashamed in front of my friends that I recommended this place

After 10 mins of requesting him to give proper table We started to leave and no one cared as if they don't even bother ..When I complained to receptionist he finally responded positively and managed to get us a decent seat where I can accommodate my 7 friends

After waiting for half an hour, we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all. We got a new waiter to whom we had to re-iterate the whole thing. Although the new waiter was really polite and helpful, but our experience was already ruined.

A super-hit club of Jubilee Hills, as per me, is finding hard to live up to its reputation.

Standard Cocktails can be made better. In food, Nachoz is good but don't expect too much non-veg in non-veg nachos - feels more like veg. Achari murg is good and so is garlic bread.

Tiki Shack,HungerDaddy,"Tiki Shak, Gachibowli - Hyderabad

The Gachibowli branch ofthis amazing pub was perhaps my best visit for having drinks, chit chat and dance with my group.

The place is only and solely for party animals, completely spacious with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have these amazing orange bulbs hanging from cane baskets on the ceiling and candlelit high seat tables.

The best time to go here is on Friday night after work, or when you feel claustrophobic at other pubs since the outdoor seating is breezy, plus there's live music by a DJ, live entertainment and wifi. So,dance at this spacious place without having to worry about bumping into your neighbours' feet.

Among drink they have everything from the regular combos of vodkas, regular margaritas, beer to Desi and angrezi whiskey. If you want to try something different after work, then do try their Helmet pop (for INR 980 - which is an experience in itself). This involves finishing your drinks bottoms up with a helmet that gets smashed with every glass you gulp.

For food, try their Chilli Cheese Toast, finger chips, Chilli chicken, masala peanuts and spring rolls. The prices are really pocket friendly.

Food is average to be honest. The french fries and nachos items could have been way better. Chicken tikka pizza was pretty bland. Chilli fish was really good though.
My friends had sex on the beach cocktail and i had virgin mojito mocktail and i must say, both of them were amazing. I had the mint cooler too and i liked virgin mojito better. Definitely worth a try.

So we just planned out of the blue, to go to a place. Mustang was on the way and we stopped there. Since it was a weekday, we got the top most seating. **Yeah, they have 3 levels of seating. And even the music was not too loud.
Addition to this, coincidentally it was an almost full moon. Everything was set for 'yeh raatein yeh mausam... No 'nadi ka keenara'😣, but there was 'chanchal hawa' 😬

Too dramatic??- I know 🤣
Anyway, so we had the topmost seating, and had this amazing, unobstructed view of the clean dark sky with an almost full moon. Could see the road stretched alongside with redlamps of cars.
Don't exactly remember the name of the cocktail, but I think it was wallbanger. And it will get you to bang the wall. 😜 Didn't have food, so can't comment. But from other tables, it was smelling delicious. A bit heavy on the pockets. But for the view it provides, worth it.

So, if it's all so good, y one star less? Here goes the answer. All was well until we were about to head out and I decided to go to the little girls room. And guess what..!! I got locked from outside 😭. Though, after I knocked on the door 3-4 times, they did open it, but how much ever I spent on the cocktails, was drained out with my conscious mind shaking me up with the realization that I was locked.

It's a happening place during weekends, not so much during weekdays, but I have never seen it overcrowded (which is why I love it so much). One negative I would say is that the price are a bit higher than their competition.",4,7 Reviews,1/30/2019 23:47,0,,"{'food': ['pizza', 'pasta'], 'drink': ['coffee', 'tea']}"

"3B's - Buddies, Bar & Barbecue",Bala Krishna,"Not worth it at all. Paid 500₹ just to end up eating curd rice for the night .

Went here last night, got a table for 3.
The service was extremely poor and slow .
The waiter.. brought ""warm"" water bottle on a summer day .. first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass .. asked for cold water .. he came back only after 3 reminders.
He was the only one around .. wearing a CSK T shirt.

When the starters started arriving I was shocked
The starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic. Un bearable.
For a person who has stayed in Hyderabad all my life .. the waiter gives an explanation that this is how Hyderabadi food tastes.

Mushroom wasn't good ..spicy and nothing less.
Fish wasn't cooked
Chicken was toooo spicy
Crispy corn .. basic item.. was oily and under cooked.
Potato Cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad

Panner didn't arrive at all

Water arrived

Left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course...
Biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora

Settled for curd rice

Icecream- asked for a butterscotch icecream with some ""gems""
Icecream was good but The gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate.. horrible .. had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry

When I was about to leave the panner starter arrived .. I had a bite .. it was ok

But I had enough already

Everyone around my table were complaining too..
But no use ..
Useless place

One should never order from Behroz biryani. Do not go with their briyani picturs shown on website in reality its only rice packed in some big attractive boxesNever try biryani here , However we were shocked to find just one piece of mutton in the Biryani. Not sure how Behrouz expected us to consume the box full of rice with a small piece of mutton. We have decided not to order anymore from this restaurant. worst of a kind and never tasted such filthy biryani in my life , and secondly they are charging bomb price for such filthy biryani ie 379 
No taste and no quality. I wonder where he brought his chef from to prepare biryani , guess from a local slum area to get this biryani made and serving to innocent public of Hyderabad

Behrouz Biryani,Khaane_mey_kya_hey By Rony Samuel,"Well this is an absolute honest review from a hardcore Hyderabadi and a true foodie.. I understand a lot of people complain about behrouz biryani but here's my review, behrouz is not a Hyderabadi biryani and is unique in itself and the brand claims it's biryani not being local.

I might not like it to the core as an Hyderabadi but as a food critique I don't have any complaints.. it's unique in it's preparation, was absolutely mild, ordered chicken lazeez biryani which had juicy chicken pieces, the quantity was sufficient for two moderate eaters, was aromatic and we'll garnished with dry fruits.

Felt the flavour was somewhere between a regular biryani and Mandi, now this review even holds strong backing as I had a Irani friend who liked it as well.

Really loved the packaging and the complimentary desert. The gulab jamun definitely killed the joy at the end, did regret eating it..and the mint raitha can definitely do be improved.

Ordered veg Shahi subz Dastarkwan which comes with the combination of veg Subz-e-biryani and falafel-e-khees. To my suprise I ordered veg and I got non-veg biryani I dont know was that an upgrade for me ?!

Nothing changed but got an add on “the black box” which has a chocolate lava cake which was the only thing good. The package was good like before and as expected. Nothing to say about that biryani because I didn’t taste it. On an assumetion the biryani was with good mutton peices and didnt look that spicy and had almond pieces over.

Chicken pieces were well cooked and melted in the mouth. Biryani tasted sweet, even with lots of masala, unlike the other conventional Hyderabadi spicy ones. Two add-On options available, Mirchi salan and mint raitha to order as required. Quantity and quality of rice is good.

Behrouz Biryani,Ankita Shilpa,"I had ordered Lazeez Bhuna Murgh Biriyani from Behrouz Biriyani. The packaging really impressed me, because in case of Biriyani when it is present in a bowl, it is tough to eat it directly from that, but Behrouz serves it in a plate kinda aluminum box, with the necessary cutleries attached, and the flat feature enables the consumer to have each spoon flavourful with no spices left out. Then about the taste of the Biriyani, well it wasn't exactly up to my expectations, as my personal choice of Biriyani is the one with the ittar aroma and spices as well, but this one had spices which tasted sweet. So it was basically a SWEET Biriyani. The chicken pieces were small and many, like big chunks, but were good. Mint raita was also impressive. If you have a sweet tooth in main courses too, then you can go for this Biriyani.

Hunger Maggi Point,Anupam Agarwal,"Its a small joint located near the DLF IT Park. Well who doesnt love Maggi and thats what draws you towards the outlet. You can either visit the place or even place order online. I have tried both methods with varying experience. 
I visited the outlet and Maggi i tasted was much better than when i ordered for home delivery. So one thing probably with Maggi is that you will relish it most of it is prepared and consumed hot without letting it dry. 

Double Egg Chicken Maggi - not as i would have expected it to be 
Double Masala chicken Maggi - definitely worth a try 
Chicken fried Maggi is my personal favorite 

Overall a nice small joint to satisfy your maggi cravings, would suggest order online if you live closeby.

I took two bites and just left it, those bites created a havoc for me the entire night. It left me with a very bad stomach pain I've never experienced before. Honestly I didn't even expect that it would create such a mess.

Always crowded with majority of the IT people nearby and all other food delivery agents waiting to take parcel. Got to know that they are also delivering till the wee hours of the night.

I was wanting to order from here once for that taste of Maggi. Who doesn't like a fancy maggi noodles? So one fine night, ordered for a Corn Masala Cheese Butter Maggi through Zomato.  That was the most fanciest name I could find on their menu. 

The delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork. The maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which I am not that big a fan of. It could have been a bit drier. But the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter & cheese in the maggi.

Late night #needforfood has been taken care by this outlet in DLF for every hungry soul out der but this time I though to order it to my office for my evening hunger. I ordered vegetable cheese Maggie and it came on time and was packed in a white box like you see in a picture.packaging is ok, the spoon was poor quality, could have been stronger to hold the Maggie.The moment I open the box, people around me could smell it and it was great, looks cheesy and yummm. So was the taste, it was good, never dissapoints. Price is nominal as well which is around 50 -70 bucks for various varieties they serve. Deserves a 4.5.

The operating time is just perfect. This place is open through the night and the area is lit. You could just go here have a cheap sumptuous meal of Maggie be it 2 or 3 am.

One portion is quite enough to fill your stomach. The place reminds one of college days and Maggi in the stalls around if you can relate.

Personal favourite: veg fried Maggi, would also recommend to try cheese veg Maggi.",3,"52 Reviews , 123 Followers",9/1/2018 0:59,0,,"{'food': ['Maggi', 'veg fried Maggi', 'cheese veg Maggi'], 'drink': []}"
